title: Synthetic aperture radar hybrid-quadrature-polarity method and architecture for obtaining the stokes parameters of radar backscatter
abstract: A synthetic aperture radar hybrid-quadrature-polarity method and architecture comprising transmitting both left and right circular polarizations (by alternately driving, at the minimum (Nyquist) sampling rate, orthogonal linear feeds simultaneously by two identical waveforms, +/−90° out of phase), and receiving two orthogonal linear polarizations, coherently. Once calibrated, the single-look complex amplitude data are sufficient to form all Stokes parameters, which fully characterize the radar backscatter.

This application is a continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 116 357 filed May 7 2008 issued as U.S. Pat. No. 7 746 267 on Jun. 29 2010 which claims the benefit of prior filed U.S. provisional application No. 60 916 673 filed on May 8 2007 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

This invention was made with Government support under Department of the Navy contract N00024 03 D 6606. The Government has certain rights in the invention.

The present invention relates generally to synthetic aperture radar SAR and more particularly to a method and architecture to maximize the measurement potential of a SAR using a unique polarimetric scheme for obtaining the Stokes parameters of the radar backscatter.

In many applications using space based synthetic aperture radar SAR the prime objective is to maximize the measurement potential thereof in response to backscatter from a random field whose elements have unknown orientation relative to the polarity of the radar s illumination. Measurement potential is maximized if and only if the data products are the Stokes parameters of the backscattered field or their logical equivalent see R. K. Raney Dual Polarized SAR and Stokes Parameters vol. 3 pp. 317 319 2006 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety . Rotational invariance implies that the transmitted polarization must be circular. The choice of polarization basis for the receiver is open to optimization of the radar s design within reliability mass and power constraints.

The high level objective of partial polarimetry or compact polarimetry these terms are used interchangeably herein is to exploit coherent dual polarized radar data to realize many of the benefits of a quadrature polarized system without the attendant costs such as halved swath coverage and doubled average transmitter power. It should be stressed that any partial polarimetry scheme is not an equivalent substitute for quadrature polarization. Partial polarimetry simply is a major and efficient step up from a single channel system towards full polarimetric measurement capabilities. Partial polarimetry is a reasonable strategy when system resources power mass data volume or cost preclude full polarimetry. Partial polarimetry is also compatible as an optional mode for any radar that implements full polarimetry.

One of the first partial polarimetric concepts was the 4 mode which posits radiating a linearly polarized field at 45 with respect to either horizontal H or vertical V orientations then receiving coherently the resulting H and V backscatter components. The concept subsequently was extended to include circularly polarized transmission with the suggestion that the two types of transmitted polarization should lead to equivalent results. It is now generally accepted that these two transmit polarizations lead to different results see R. K. Raney Decomposition of hybrid polarity SAR data presented at POLinSAR Frascati Italy 2007 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety . For clarity as used herein hybrid polarity refers to the circular transmit H V linear receive case in contrast to the 4 mode which refers to the slant linear transmit H V linear receive case. Both of these mixed polarity modes have been used extensively in meteorological radar.

In the 4 mode decomposition analyses are most successful for scatterers within the scene whose orientation distributions are predominantly horizontal or vertical. In contrast however the objective of many applications is to ascertain the prevailing orientation of backscattering constituents rather than to presume them at the outset. For such applications an a priori assumption on backscatterer orientation is not appropriate. Further there are important applications such as planetary geology in which decomposition should be able to classify dihedral like backscattering features regardless of their orientation. Such applications are best served by rotational invariance which requires that the illumination be circularly polarized. In short the preferred form of compact polarimetry depends on the intended application.

An alternative compact polarimetric approach is to receive coherent dual circular polarizations in response to a circularly polarized transmitted field. End to end circular polarization has an extensive heritage in radar astronomy from which very good results have been obtained including backscatter analyses based on Stokes parameters. A spacecraft SAR that is circularly polarized on transmit and dual circularly polarized on receive would be a viable alternative to the hybrid polarity architecture described herein but only if the required hardware were more appealing and the resulting measurements were comparably robust. However such an embodiment implies several disadvantages in hardware and performance that are avoided by the hybrid polarity method of this invention.

Circular polarization is not entirely foreign to Earth observing SARs. Noteworthy examples include analysis of quadrature polarized data from sloping terrain for which it has been shown that synthesis of circularly polarized data leads to results that are superior to those from the more conventional linearly polarized data construct. However in all such cases the starting point requires data generated by a quadrature polarized system thus invoking all of the attendant disadvantages of that mode.

Recent studies conducted in support of two radars being implemented for deployment at the Moon have looked carefully at alternative architectures within the constraints of small lunar orbiters. The science requirements include measurement of the circular polarization ratio maximized potential to distinguish between backscatter types and robustness to randomly oriented dihedral backscatterer distributions. The implementation requirements include minimal mass and power.

A dual polarimetric SAR transmits only one polarization and receives on two orthogonal polarizations. Conventional dual polarized SARs use only linear polarizations. Applicant s invention described and claimed in U.S. Pat. No. 7 746 267 posits transmitting circular polarization and receiving on two orthogonal linear polarizations.

A quadrature polarimetric SAR transmits on orthogonal polarizations one polarization at a time alternating between the two polarization states between transmissions. Two orthogonal polarizations are received following each transmission. Conventional quadrature polarization SARs use linear polarizations typically H OR V on transmission and H AND V on reception.

The present invention extends Applicant s prior invention described and claimed in U.S. Pat. No. 7 746 267 to a quadrature polarization SAR in which the transmissions are orthogonal circular polarizations alternating between left circular L OR right circular R and the received polarizations in each case are coherent linear polarizations H AND V .

Full characterization of the radar backscatter implies measurement of sixteen Stokes parameters a product of the four corresponding to the degrees of freedom in the transmitted fields and the four corresponding to the backscattered field.

A fundamental principal applies For either the transmitted or the received electromagnetic field the values of the Stokes parameters are independent of the polarization basis in which the fields are transmitted or observed.

Accordingly the present invention provides a method and architecture for a synthetic aperture radar SAR having a hybrid polarity architecture CL pol that transmits circular polarization and receives two orthogonal mutually coherent linear polarizations. This architecture applies equally to either a partial compact polarimetric SAR or to a fully quadrature polarimetric SAR.

According to one aspect of the invention a method is provided for obtaining the Stokes parameters representing a backscattered field from a partial polarimetric synthetic aperture radar SAR comprising the steps of 

According to another aspect of the invention a partial polarimetric synthetic aperture radar SAR is provided for obtaining the Stokes parameters representing a backscattered field comprising 

a dual linearly polarized antenna comprising as a representative example a horizontal H feed and a vertical V feed 

a 90 degree hybrid or a 90 degree hybrid operatively connected to the transmitter and the antenna for simultaneously driving the H and V feeds 90 degrees out of phase thereby causing the antenna to radiate a left circularly polarized field for a 90 degree hybrid or a right circularly polarized radiated field for a 90 degree hybrid 

a receiver operatively connected to the antenna for receiving a coherent H and V linearly polarized backscattered field and

a processor operatively connected to the receiver for obtaining the Stokes parameters from data embedded in the backscattered field.

According to another aspect of the invention the transmitted field may be either right circularly polarized R or left circularly polarized L .

According to another aspect of the invention if R and L transmissions are interleaved such that the pulse repetition frequency of each polarization satisfies the minimum Nyquist sampling rate and two orthogonal linear polarizations are received after each transmission then the resulting architecture is a hybrid quadrature polarized embodiment of the hybrid polarity architecture. This embodiment may be realized by the simple expedient of reversing the sign of the hybrid device between transmissions thus toggling back and forth between L and R circular transmissions.

According to another aspect of the invention if sufficient data in the hybrid quadrature polarized embodiment of the invention is collected to calculate the 4 4 coherency matrix of the complex scene reflectivity function then those data may be used to calculate the 16 Stokes parameters of the scattering function.

According to another aspect of the invention the received data from the partial polarimetric embodiment are used to calculate a 2 2 coherency matrix of the backscattered field.

According to another aspect of the invention the 4 Stokes parameters of the backscattered field or equivalently the coherency matrix can be analyzed by decomposition techniques whose parameter space is defined by a degree of polarization m and a relative phase delta two parameters that are presented as an example but are not meant to limit the scope of the invention.

Advantages of the resulting SAR method and architecture include minimizing sensitivity to relative errors and cross talk and optimizing several aspects of relative phase and amplitude calibration which are required for quantitative measurements. Further advantages include a simpler system with less RF hardware less mass and power requirements and fewer losses in comparison to alternative means of realizing a coherent dual polarized SAR.

Another advantage of this invention is that the swath width for a partially polarimetric SAR can be increased by ScanSAR techniques with respect to the width of a conventional strip mapping SAR mode while still being polarimetric in contrast to quadrature polarimetric mode in which the swath width is only one half that of a conventional strip map SAR.

A major advantage for the quadrature polarimetric embodiment is that the level of range ambiguities is minimized relative to the desired polarimetric signal. This has the benefit of extending the useful range swath and incident angle of the instrument.

Another major advantage of the quadrature polarimetric embodiment is that there always is equality between the mean signal levels in the two orthogonal receive channels thus simplifying receiver design and improving calibration.

In the following discussion numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. However those skilled in the art will appreciate that the present invention may be practiced without such specific details. In other instances well known elements have been illustrated in schematic or block diagram form in order not to obscure the present invention in unnecessary detail.

The underlying theory with regard to the Stokes parameters is well known in the art. A monochromatic electromagnetic EM field is represented by the ellipse swept out by its electric potential vector E EE . In general analytic form the orthogonal components of E are where represents the EM oscillation and represents the relative phase between the two components. Stokes proved that such a field could be represented by four real numbers known as the Stokes parameters S S S S . These often are represented as S SSSS which is a logical vector where denotes transpose. In this formalism the Stokes parameters expressed in the backscatter alignment BSA convention appropriate for a monostatic radar geometry are 2 2 2sin 2 2 where the . . . indicate temporal or locally spatial averages and the several J terms indicate elements of the 2 2 coherency matrix J which is Hermitian. The intensity of the field is the trace TrJ J J the first Stokes parameter and the degree of polarization in terms of the coherency matrix elements is 1 4 1 3 where 4 is the complex degree of coherence. These quantities together with other key parameters such as the two eigenvalues are rotationally invariant thus they are not dependent on the particular polarimetric basis in which their values are determined. This fundamental fact forms part of the foundation for the architecture of the invention described and claimed herein.

Given a coherent dual polarized synthetic aperture radar SAR where the SAR s transmitted field is right circularly polarized R then starting from focused single look complex data the four Stokes parameters in linear and circular polarization bases at the receiver are 2 2 2 2 5 In these expressions E is the complex voltage in the subscripted polarization denotes complex conjugate . . . denotes averaging multi looking in the SAR context and Re and Im select the real or the imaginary value respectively of the complex cross product amplitude. The first subscript denotes the transmit polarization and the second subscript indicates the receive polarization.

The customary model for dual polarization is to assume that the received basis is the same as the transmitted basis. In this context that would be circular in and circulars out for which the largest example is the Arecibo radar telescope at the Arecibo Observatory Puerto Rico. The right side column Eqn 5 corresponds to this familiar case. The invention described and claimed herein however is aimed at the unconventional alternative the circular in and linears out combination. The Stokes parameters in the left side column Eqn 5 correspond to this hybrid polarity CL pol architecture.

Each of the Stokes parameters is an elementary combination of two numbers drawn from the powers real in the two channels and the cross product of the complex amplitudes. The cross product or equivalently the corresponding differential phase consists of two real numbers the signed amplitudes of its real and imaginary components. The resulting set of four real numbers evaluated at each pixel location in the multi look image domain comprises the fundamental output data from a coherent dual polarized SAR. Of course there are alternative frames of reference for the data products such as the elements of the 2 2 coherency or covariance matrices. In principle what is described herein applies equally to all such formulations.

There are two essential points to the above 1 relative phase is required in addition to the amplitudes of the dual polarized images if the backscattered field is to be fully characterized and 2 for any given field the resulting characterization is independent of the particular basis vectors in which the coherent dual polarized measurements are made.

Three quantitative measures of direct relevance to what is described herein follow from the Stokes parameters measured in the backscattered field. The first of these is the degree of polarization 6 This form follows from the fundamental expression derived from the coherency matrix. Degree of polarization is closely related to the coherency parameter Eqn 4 which when expressed in terms of the Stokes parameters is 7 The second parameter of interest is the circular polarization ratio 0 8 which is the traditional indicator of frozen volatile deposits. The third parameter is the relative phase between the two linear E vectors of the backscattered field tan 180 

Transmission of any field that is dominated by a linearly polarized component introduces a rotational selectivity onto the observation. This is true regardless of the linearity orientation be it horizontal H or vertical V or somewhere in between. When illuminated by linearly polarized radiation the backscattered polarization from a dihedral for example will depend to first order on the relative alignment of the axis of the dihedral with respect to the incoming field.

One scheme that has been proposed to sidestep the problem of conventional horizontal H or vertical V transmit polarization is to choose a linear polarization at 45 with respect to horizontal. This scheme still retains unwanted sensitivity to the orientation of linear features in the scene. In general transmission of any field that has a dominant linearly polarized component will lead to ambiguities or omissions in double bounce decomposition. This is the fundamental characteristic that separates the present invention from any radar that transmits only in a single linear polarization.

The only globally valid solution to the above is to transmit circular polarization. Only a circularly polarized transmitted field leads to rotationally invariant backscatter since there is no favored linear alignment between the illumination and the scene s geometrical structure.

The expected sense of received circular polarization is opposite to the transmitted sense in terms of the jargon of radar astronomy. For example transmitting right R circularly polarized usually results in left L polarized backscatter being stronger so that R becomes the cross polarized receive state. This is because odd bounce reflection usually dominates as from specular facets Bragg scattering from random rough distributions or trihedrals 3 sided corners either natural or fabricated . Single bounce circular polarization reversal is put to good use for example to separate GPS sea surface specular reflections from the direct path transmissions. 

In contrast double bounce backscatter such as from dihedral reflectors imposes an even number of phase reversals in the linear EM component that is aligned with the dihedral s axis. This has the effect of two offsetting phase reversals leading to stronger backscatter in the same sense circular polarity. As a direct consequence double bounce reflections of circularly polarized waves are indicated rather sensitively by their relative phase. In the case of a lossless dihedral the phase would differ by 180 degrees relative to that from a single bounce scattering surface or from alternative odd bounce shapes.

Enhanced same sense circularly polarized returns also may arise for reasons other than double bounce. An important measurement in radar astronomy is the circular polarization ratio Eqn 8 . This usually is evaluated as an explicit ratio of the image power in the same sense circular polarization divided by the image power in the opposite sense circular polarization under the condition that the transmitted polarization is circular. The circular polarization ratio is anomalously large in response to volume scattering from ice deposits as on Europa or in the polar craters of Mercury. Under favorable conditions the observed can exceed unity from such natural features. Of course from a perfectly conducting dihedral could be very large indeed.

The fundamental point to be drawn from these and related considerations is that the radar must transmit circular polarization if the backscattered field is to be rotationally invariant with respect to the geometric characteristics of the scene or if circularly polarized signatures as well as linearly polarized signatures are to be observed.

Given that the transmitted polarization is circular it would be natural to assume that the radar must be dual circularly polarized on receive. However such a conventional approach would fail to realize the advantages afforded by the inventive method and architecture described and claimed herein.

To date all conventional dual polarized radars and also all quadrature polarized radars for that matter are designed such that the receive polarization basis agrees with the transmitted basis. It follows that there always must be a like polarized and a cross polarized channel in the receiver in which signal levels differ by up to 10 dB or more. Performance of a multi polarization radar usually is limited by the weaker cross polarized link which is most impacted by additive noise and by cross talk and ambiguities from the stronger like polarized signal.

Fundamental principles assure that the total power backscattered from a given scene element will be conserved when split into any pair of orthogonal polarizations. The obvious implication is that the energy will be divided evenly if and only if the receive polarizations have no like or cross polarized relationship to the transmitted polarization. Thus if circular polarization is transmitted the receive polarization basis should be linear. While this combination is contrarian it is objectively superior to all alternatives. This feature is a characteristic of the method and architecture of the present invention.

The Stokes parameters provide the foundation for this approach since their evaluation does not depend on the measurement polarization basis. Consider an example. The circular polarization ratio expressed in terms of the Stokes parameters is S S S S . Hence may be calculated from either linearly polarized or circularly polarized received data if the surface is illuminated by circularly polarized transmissions.

The underlying principle of the hybrid polarity architecture is that linear polarization is a perfectly acceptable basis for a dual polarized receiver observing backscatter from circularly polarized transmissions.

A generic diagram of the hybrid polarity CL pol architecture that results from the above discussion is shown in . A dual linearly polarized antenna radiates circular polarization if the H and V feeds are driven simultaneously by equal average power 90 out of phase. As in the passive antenna embodiment illustrated in this requires passing the transmitter output through a 90 hybrid whose outputs feed the H elements and the V elements respectively. Also shown are receiver comprising channels for receiving a coherent H and V linearly polarized backscattered field. Timing and control means and a processor to process the data from the receiver channels are also shown. The antennas for several contemporary Earth observing SARs are active arrays invariably comprised of H or V polarized elements in which case each the same methodology applies. In such embodiments each of the active elements would have to be activated and phased accordingly.

In the passive case if there were a requirement to receive dual circular polarizations then there would have to be an additional pair of 90 hybrids in the receive paths either directly after the antenna or further along down each of the receive chains. However 90 hybrids introduce additional mass and losses as well as additional error sources in amplitude and phase. The hybrid polarity method and architecture of the present invention avoids these extra burdens.

Target decomposition methodologies similar to those applied to fully polarimetric data are applicable to data from a hybrid polarity system. For example double bounce backscatter generates an unambiguous and distinct phase signature through a hybrid polarity SAR. The double bounce phase signature is independent of the relative orientation of reflecting dihedrals with respect to the linear basis vectors of the receive channels.

The precedent for quadrature polarimetric radar target decomposition is extensive see S. R. Cloude and E. Pottier A review of target decomposition theorems in radar polarimetry vol. 34 pp. 498 518 1996 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety but the techniques are not necessarily appropriate for the simpler CL pol architecture. The applicable 2 2 coherency matrix Eqn 3 lends itself to a streamlined decomposition methodology.

At the outset note that the two normalized eigenvalues depend upon only one parameter the degree of polarization m Eqns 3 and 6 . The eigenvalues are 1 where 1 and 01 10 The entropy of coherent dual polarized data is ln ln 11 which is monotonic between the minimum value of zero when 1 and the maximum value of unity when . Respectively these extrema represent the fully polarized case m 1 and the fully depolarized case m 0 . The degree of polarization has long been recognized as the single most important parameter characteristic of a partially polarized EM field see E. Wolf Coherence properties of partially polarized electromagnetic radiation vol. 13 pp. 1165 1181 1959 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety . The close relationship between entropy and degree of polarization has been verified experimentally see A. Aiello and J. P. Woerdman Physical bounds to the entropy depolarization relation in random light scattering vol. 94 pp. 1 4 2005 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety . The CL pol decomposition scheme described and claimed herein is based on degree of polarization m as its first discriminant.

The Stokes parameters offer several candidates for a second decomposition parameter. Of these the relative phase Eqn 9 has the advantages that it is the most sensitive to polarimetric variations in the backscattered field and that it is independent of a gain imbalance between the H and V receive channels. Under the condition of circularly polarized illumination is the prime indicator of double bounce backscatter and is the dominant ingredient in Stokes derived norms such as the circular polarization ratio Eqn 8 .

There are alternatives to the above. For example the coherent single look complex SLC H V data are sufficient to calculate the 2 2 coherency matrix. Principal component analysis would follow from the coherency matrix eigenvectors Likewise the coherency matrix could be expanded into the four Pauli spin matrices whose weighting coefficients are the Stokes parameters see U. Fano A Stokes parameter technique for the treatment of polarization in quantum mechanics vol. 93 pp. 121 123 1954 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety .

The over arching inventive concept is that all of the data embedded in a dual polarized backscattered field set up by an CL pol radar can be captured by the Stokes parameters. Once these data are in hand then any appropriate analysis methodology may be applied.

The famous AIRSAR L band data collected by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory JPL over the city of San Francisco provides a valuable test case to demonstrate the effectiveness of the CL pol architecture in general and m decomposition in particular. In brief the original quad pol data were transformed to replicate circularly polarized transmission and coherent H and V polarized reception. The synthesis methodology for this transformation is outlined in the Appendix. The degree of polarization m and the relative phase were found from the resulting Stokes parameters.

The results are shown in an m feature space plot which is similar in principle to the entropy alpha H decomposition although there are significant differences. The histograms of m and are shown in . Note that fully polarized fully coherent appears at m 1 in the m decomposition which is the obverse of fully polarized that corresponds to H 0 in the H method. One might argue that fully polarized unity is satisfying since it is parallel to full coherence unity . Note also that has a span of 360 .

The San Francisco CL pol data demonstrate clear clustering tendencies in m space such as the neighborhoods of 0.85 90 and 0.95 90 . These correspond to the expected opposite circular polarization return from quasi specular odd bounce reflectors and same sense circular polarization from dihedral reflectors in response to right circularly polarized transmission. This decomposition suggests that the dominant scattering mechanism within the San Francisco scene is double bounce most likely from the urban dihedral dominated buildings which agrees with the original quad pol interpretation. See the Appendix for a verification of this partition and also for proof that the CL pol architecture is not sensitive to the relative orientation of the dihedral axis with respect to horizontal. 

Note that the nominally pure circularly polarized dihedral distribution is centered at about 75 rather than 90 . In effect this provides an indirect measure of the imperfect circularity of the transmitted field synthesized from AirSAR s interleaved H and V transmissions . This demonstrates two interesting properties of the CL pol architecture 1 robustness in the face of imperfect transmitted circular polarity and 2 a means of calibration that does not require controlled point targets active or passive in the scene. More on the calibration aspects of this architecture may be found in a POLinSAR paper incorporated by reference above.

The above discussion illustrates that data from CL pol SAR architecture has a high potential for quantitative techniques. Analysis of such data by m feature space or alternative methodologies is novel.

Hybrid polarity SAR architecture leads to an efficient and flight worthy instrument that supports a complete and objective dual polarized measurement taxonomy. The architecture is characterized by several advantages 

Stokes parameter data products. Coherently dual polarized received signals in the linear basis are sufficient to calculate the four Stokes parameters which are rotationally invariant with respect to geometric trends in the scene since the transmit polarization is circular. Data products derived from the Stokes parameters do not depend on the polarization basis of the observation. All information in the backscattered field is retained.

Comparable signal levels. Neither receive channel is disadvantaged by being cross polarized. Mean signal levels in the two channels of a CL pol radar should always agree. For the same transmitted average power the mean signal levels will be weaker by 3 dB than the signal level of the like or expected polarization in a conventional dual polarized radar hence 3 dB to 7 dB stronger than would be seen in the cross or unexpected polarized channel. There are two alternatives for circumventing the apparent 3 dB disadvantage the first Stokes parameter preserves all backscattered power and the single look complex data could also be synthesized in the processor to provide explicit R and L images.

Cross talk. Since the mean signal levels in the two receive channels have comparable levels there is less risk of cross talk or ambiguities from the stronger polarization corrupting the weaker polarization.

Calibration. When the radar is looking at nominally level but otherwise random terrain at nadir the first and second order statistics of the signals in the two receive paths should be identical regardless of the geometrical characteristics of the backscattering elements. If in practice they are not equal such as gain or spectral offsets then these discrepancies can be measured and compensated. Likewise the relative phase between the H and V components of the transmitted circular polarization and the received polarizations H and V can be separately observed in real random backscatter then compensated. These self checking properties are unique to the hybrid polarity architecture.

Error sensitivity. A sensitivity analysis shows that the circular polarization ratio derived through a CL pol SAR is less sensitive to channel imbalance by at least a factor of two than if explicitly calculated through the traditional same sense over opposite sense ratio. The hybrid polarity error sensitivity advantage is more pronounced when the relative signal to noise ratios of the two polarization components are included in the analysis.

Favorable flight hardware. In many specific cases less RF hardware is required in the CL pol architecture than for an alternative design in which the radar is circularly polarized on both transmit and receive. The simpler CL pol architecture implies fewer losses and fewer sources of potential channel to channel mismatch. For planetary or lunar missions for which mass and power are severely limited these hardware advantages coupled with the enhanced measurement capabilities of the present invention point to the CL pol as the optimum architecture.

Quadrature polarimetric embodiment. The hybrid polarity architecture when operated such that the transmissions are alternated between L and R at Nyquist rate and in each case the received data are orthogonal linear polarizations and their relative phase becomes a hybrid quadrature polarity radar.

Range ambiguity suppression. The most troublesome range ambiguities those false signals arriving at the receiver from terrain to either side of the intended range swath are always much weaker in the hybrid quadrature polarimetric architecture than for any other combination of transmit and receive polarizations including especially the conventional SAR architecture in which matched linear polarizations are used on both transmission and reception.

The dual polarized hybrid polarity architecture may be operated in a ScanSAR mode in principle identical to ScanSAR swath widening techniques in a single polarity side looking imaging radar. This is true because only one transmitted polarization is required for the hybrid polarity architecture in distinct contrast to a quadrature polarized SAR for which two orthogonal polarizations must be transmitted interleaved at an effective pulse repetition frequency PRF that is twice that of the normal single polarity mapping mode. Double PRF means that the swath width can be no more than half that of the single polarity mapping mode. Thus the hybrid polarity method and architecture of the present invention enables polarimetric SAR operations over swaths that are four times or more the width that are the upper limit for an otherwise equivalent quadrature polarimetric SAR.

The objective of the invention in the dual polarized embodiment is full characterization and exploitation of the backscattered field with a monostatic radar that transmits in only one polarization that is invariant to geometrical orientations in the scene and that minimizes on board resource requirements. Full characterization of the field requires measurement of the four Stokes parameters. Once these parameters are stipulated to be the radar s data products then hybrid polarity CL pol architecture is the logical result. The arguments to this end progress through four ordered conclusions 1 the receiver must be coherently dual polarized 2 the transmit polarization must be circular 3 the receiver polarization basis does not have to be circular and 4 the optimum receiver polarization basis is linear.

The pivotal objective reasons for these conclusions are 1 the Stokes parameters require measuring the relative phase as well as the amplitudes of the received backscatter 2 any non circular illuminating polarization would impose preferential selectivity onto the backscattered polarizations in response to the relative alignment between the principal axis of the incoming elliptically polarized field and the angular orientation of scene constituents 3 Stokes parameter values are independent of the observation polarization basis and 4 signal levels in the two receivers are comparable if and only if the like and cross polarized constituents are evenly shared because backscattered energy is conserved within any dual polarized basis.

The CL pol SAR architecture minimizes sensitivity to relative errors and cross talk and optimizes several aspects of relative phase and amplitude calibration which are required for quantitative measurements. The CL pol architecture can lead to a simpler system with less RF hardware less mass and power requirements and fewer losses in comparison to alternative means of realizing a coherent dual polarized SAR all of which are required for a lunar planetary or earth observing orbital radar.

Any extant radar that has simultaneous linearly polarized dual channel reception and that transmits either H or V polarization can be operated as a CL pol system if the H and V transmissions are simultaneous and 90 degrees out of phase. In contrast to an otherwise similar quadrature polarized radar a CL pol system is not compromised by doubled average transmit power and halved swath width.

The Stokes parameters or their equivalent derived from the radar processor s single look complex data output products support more and better quantitative measurements than would be available from a conventional dual polarized radar including the circular polarization ratio along with several other quantitative characterizations in the image domain. Data from a CL pol SAR are fully characterized through a 2 2 matrix which is well suited to a streamlined decomposition strategy. The effectiveness of CL pol decomposition is comparable to that of quad pol target decomposition in several regards as demonstrated by the m method.

The CL pol architecture circular transmit polarization and coherent dual linear polarization is an alternative mode for Earth observing imaging radars and as the prime architecture for all lunar or planetary imaging radar missions.

All of the foregoing observations relative to the partial polarimetric single transmitted polarization carry over to the alternating dual circularly polarized case namely the hybrid quad pol embodiment.

While the invention has been described with reference to an example embodiment it will be understood by those skilled in the art that a variety of modifications additions and deletions are within the scope of the invention as defined by the claims set forth below.
