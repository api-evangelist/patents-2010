title: System and method of application development using replaceable self-contained components (RSCCS)
abstract: A method and system for creating a software application code including multiple Replaceable Self-Contained Components (RSCCs) is disclosed. In one embodiment, the method includes creating each RSCC by instantiating and initializing an object instance of a Replaceable Component Class (RCC) that substantially encapsulates construction code of a Self-Contained Component (SCC), creating an RSCC registration module which resides in each of a first set of RSCCs for registering each of the services provided by each of the first set of RSCCs with the service registration object, and creating an RSCC service finding module which resides in each of a second set of RSCCs for consuming each of the services provided by one of the first set of RSCCs for facilitating communication between the RSCCs in the software application code upon an event selected from the group consisting of a user event, a sensor event, a timer event, and a data/state change event.
