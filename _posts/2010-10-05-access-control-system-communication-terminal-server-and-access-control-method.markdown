The present invention relates to an access control system a communication terminal a server and an access control method and particularly to an access control system a communication terminal a server and an access control method capable of being applied to providing services through a communication network.

Many web services are provided through the Internet. A server web server provides a service in response to a request from a client terminal. Specifically for example services provided include information providing services through websites providing web applications application programs and providing other kinds of information. Some of web servers are configured to change display layouts or decide on whether to provide services on a per client terminal basis.

A user agent UA given to an HTTP HyperText Transfer Protocol request header is often used as client terminal determination means.

A web server can refer to the UA to determine a client terminal. Specifically the type of a web browser program being used hereinafter simply called a web browser or a browser as well or the model name of a client terminal can be identified. However for example it cannot determine which application is to run on a web browser like a web application.

Therefore the web server cannot make determinations on whether to provide a service to trusted applications and not to provide the service to the others. To enable such determinations it is required a mechanism for notifying a web server of the feature of a calling application from a client terminal when the application running on the client terminal accesses the web server i.e. for example when the client terminal makes a connection request to the web server through the Internet under the control of an application program installed thereon. Note that the feature of an application means for example an origin of the application specifically for example a creator of the application or an authority that has certified the creator .

The confirmation of an application feature is made through a certification process and a signature affixed to the application is often used in the certification process. In the certification process it is verified whether a certificate for the signature was issued by a trusted certificate authority CA to determine whether the application is trusted. Whether the CA is trusted is generally determined by a certificate called a root certificate issued by a root certificate authority.

As a method of notifying the web server of the application feature there is considered a method of notifying the web server of the result of the certification process executed by the client terminal. For example the client terminal verifies an SSL Secure Sockets Layer certificate sent from web server A to execute a certification process for determining whether an application provided by the web server A is trusted. Then the application sends the result of the certification process to server B as an access destination. Based on the sent certification result the web server B can determine whether it is a connection request from a trusted application to restrict access restrict connection processing .

Patent Literature PTL 1 discloses a system equipped with an access control server for determining the advisability of a connection to a service providing server.

Since any root certificate contained in a web browser can be added by a user the above mentioned method of notifying the web server of the application feature may cause a case where information such as the root certificate is information untrusted for the web server. However even if a certification process is executed on the application based on such an added root certificate the client terminal will certify that the application is trusted. As a result since the web server recognizes that the request to the web server from the application installed on the client terminal is a request from a trusted application accesses unintended by the web server to allow may be made. In other words when a root certificate is added a connection request to be originally denied by the web server may be allowed.

The system described in PTL 1 uses an access control server for determining the advisability of a connection to a service providing server and this causes a problem that the introduction and management of the system is costly. Further since the system described in PTL 1 is to determine the advisability of the connection to the service providing server on a user by user basis access unintended originally by the web server to allow may be made from an application used by a user the connection of which is allowed.

It is an object of the present invention to provide an access control system a communication terminal a server and an access control method capable of denying access in response to an access request from an application the connection of which is not intended by the server to allow.

According to the present invention access in response to an access request from an application unintended by the server to allow can be denied. In other words access control can be performed on an application by application basis.

An access control system of a first exemplary embodiment according to the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. is a block diagram showing a configuration example of the access control system of the first exemplary embodiment according to the present invention.

As shown in the access control system of the first exemplary embodiment according to the present invention includes a communication terminal and a server where an application server is connected to the communication terminal . The communication terminal is also connected to the server .

The application server includes an application storage section in which an application as an application program provided to the communication terminal is stored. The application is downloaded by the communication terminal .

The communication terminal includes application acquisition means an application storage section application certification means a certificate storage section a certification information storage section request means and application execution means .

The server includes request accepting means request certification means a certificate storage section a service storage section access control means and a policy storage section .

Referring next to the block diagram and flowcharts the operation of the access control system of the exemplary embodiment will be described.

The operation of the access control system is divided into the following three operations 1 an application certification process executed by the communication terminal 2 a request process from the communication terminal to the server and 3 a request certification process performed by the server . The following will describe respective processes in the exemplary embodiment.

First 1 the application certification process executed by the communication terminal will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. is a flowchart showing the application certification process. The application acquisition means of the communication terminal downloads DL the application from the application server step S .

When a certificate is added to the application Yes in step S the application certification means execute a certificate verification process certification process step S . For example the certificate electronic certificate is electronic data signed by a CA or the like in an electronic manner. For example the certificate includes the name of a certificate holder a public key of the certificate holder the ID of the CA an electronic signature of the CA and the like.

The certificate verification process is for example a process of determining whether a certificate stored in the certificate storage section agrees with the certificate added to the application . The certificate verification process may be executed by any other method.

When determining in the certificate verification process in step S that the certificate stored in the certificate storage section agrees with the certificate added to the application Yes in step S the application certification means stores certification information in the certification information storage section as a verification result step S . Specifically the application certification means stores the application information in the certification information storage section in association with certification information. When the certificate stored in the certificate storage section agrees with the certificate added to the application the certification information is stored in the certification information storage section as the verification result. Therefore the certification information stored in the certification information storage section means that the application indicated by the application information associated with the certification information is certified in the certificate verification process certification process .

Then the application acquisition means stores in the application storage section the application downloaded from the application server in the processing step S step S .

Next 2 the request process from the communication terminal to the server will be described. is a flowchart showing the request process. The following will be described by taking as an example a case where the communication terminal accesses the server based on the program control of the application downloaded by the communication terminal in the above processing step S when it makes a connection request access request . During execution of the application stored in the application storage section the application execution means outputs to the request means an instruction given to make an access request to the server hereinafter simply called the access request based on the program control of the application step S .

In response to receipt of the access request the request means acquires certification information corresponding to the application from the certification information storage section step S . Specifically it tries to acquire the certification information. In the example shown in since the certification information associated with the URL of the application is stored in the certification information storage section Yes in step S the hash value for the certificate as the certification information is obtained by using as a key the ID of the application specifically the URL indicative of the storage location of the application . After acquiring the certification information the request means adds the certification information to the access request step S and sends a request access request information to the server step S . is an explanatory drawing showing an example of the access request information in the exemplary embodiment. In the example shown in the access request information includes the ID of a calling application the URL of the application a content requested requested content information and certification information. In the example shown in the access request information is information requested by the application to the server to send data.

Next 3 the request certification process executed by the server will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. is a flowchart showing the request certification process. The request accepting means receives an access request specifically access request information from the communication terminal step S and passes the access request information to the request certification means to perform verification step S .

The request certification means fetches certification information from the access request information to check whether it matches a certificate prestored in the certificate storage section . In this example as shown in since the access request information includes a hash value for a certificate as the certification information the request certification means calculates a hash value for the certificate prestored in the certificate storage section to check whether the hash value as the calculation result matches the hash value indicated by the certification information.

Here it is assumed that the hash value indicated by the certification information matches a hash value for a certificate issued by a certificate authority a CA  prestored in the certificate storage section . After that the access control means refers to a policy stored in the policy storage section to determine the advisability of access step S . Note that the policy policy information is information indicating by which certificate authority a certificate contained in an application has issued and which data the application is allowed to access. In the policy storage section IDs of certificate authorities e.g. CA  CA  CA  and data e.g. data data data data to which access is allowed for each ID of the certificate authorities are stored.

In this example since the hash value included in the access request information matches the hash value for the certificate issued by the certificate authority a CA  the application is allowed to access data Yes in step S . When the access is allowed Yes in step S the request accepting means fetches data data from the service storage section step S and returns a response to the communication terminal step S . Specifically the fetched data data is sent to the communication terminal .

In the exemplary embodiment since the communication terminal sends certification information on an application to the server the server can figure out upon which application the request is based specifically by which certificate authority the application is certified . Since the server verifies the certification information the validity of the certification process executed by the communication terminal is confirmed. Further access control can be performed according to a policy stored in the policy storage section of the server . Even if the user of the communication terminal adds a certificate to the certificate storage section and the application is certified by the certificate since the access can be denied in the request certification process and access control using the policy performed by the server the server will not allow unintended access. In other words a policy based on a certificate issued by a predetermined certificate authority can be set for the server to perform access control on each application.

Thus in the exemplary embodiment the server can restrict access for each requester s content. The reason is that the communication terminal sends the server the request with the content of the certification information added thereto. Further the server can restrict access according to a server s policy. The reason is that the server side has a mechanism for performing certification again according to its own policy based on the certification information sent from the communication terminal.

An access control system of a second exemplary embodiment according to the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. is a block diagram showing a configuration example of the access control system of the second exemplary embodiment according to the present invention.

As shown in in the access control system of the second exemplary embodiment according to the present invention an additional certificate storage section and verification means are added to the communication terminal in the first exemplary embodiment shown in . Further the server in the access control system of the second exemplary embodiment according to the present invention does not include the request certification means and the certificate storage section . In the additional certificate storage section a certificate added by the user of the communication terminal is stored. The verification means verifies in a certificate verification process whether a certificate matching the certificate added to the application is the certificate stored in the certificate storage section .

The operation of the access control system of the exemplary embodiment will be described. In the exemplary embodiment in the processing step S of 1 the application certification process executed by the communication terminal shown in it is determined whether the certificate added to the application matches the certificate stored in the certificate storage section or the certificate stored in the additional certificate storage section . Since the other processing is the same as 1 the application certification process executed by the communication terminal in the first exemplary embodiment shown in the description thereof will be omitted.

Next 2 the request process from the communication terminal to the server in the exemplary embodiment will be described. is a flowchart showing processing added in the exemplary embodiment to the 2 the request process from the communication terminal to the server in the first exemplary embodiment shown in .

In the first exemplary embodiment the request means acquires the certification information in the processing step S shown in while in the exemplary embodiment the verification means acquires certification information from the certification information storage section after the request means acquires the certification information step S .

Further in the first exemplary embodiment when there is the certification information in the processing step S shown in the processing step S for adding the certification information is performed. However in the second exemplary embodiment the verification means verifies the certification information before the processing step S step S . The verification means checks whether the certification information is verified by the certificate stored in the certificate storage section in the processing step S of 1 the application certification process executed by the communication terminal .

Specifically a hash value for the certificate stored in the certificate storage section is calculated to check whether the hash value matches the hash value for the certificate added to the application illustrated in . When they match the verification means determines that the request is from the application verified by the certificate stored in the certificate storage section . When they do not match it determines that the request is verified by the added certificate stored in the additional certificate storage section .

When it is determined that the request is verified by the certificate stored in the certificate storage section Yes in S the procedure moves to the processing step S. In the first exemplary embodiment the request means adds in the processing step S a hash value to the access request as certification information while in the second exemplary embodiment the request means adds in the processing step S the ID of the certificate authority to the access request. is an explanatory drawing showing an example of access request information in the exemplary embodiment. The access request information in the exemplary embodiment shown in includes the ID of a calling application the URL of the application a content requested and the ID of a certificate authority. The request means acquires the ID of the certificate authority from the certificate stored in the certificate storage section .

Next 3 the request certification process executed by the server in the exemplary embodiment will be described. In the first exemplary embodiment the verification process is executed on the access request information in step S of while in the exemplary embodiment the procedure moves to the processing step S after completion of the processing step S without performing the processing step S. In other words as shown in since the ID of the certificate authority is included in the certification information sent from the communication terminal to the server the procedure moves to the determination on the advisability of access in step S after completion of the processing step S. Since the subsequent processing is the same as that in the first exemplary embodiment the description thereof will be omitted.

In the exemplary embodiment the certificate originally installed on the communication terminal prestored in the certification information storage section and the added certificate stored in the additional certificate storage section are managed separately. Then it is configured that when the hash value for the certificate of the application matches the hash value for the certificate originally installed the ID of the certificate authority is sent to the server . Therefore when the communication terminal accesses the server the server can determine whether the accessing application is certified by the certificate originally installed. Thus unlike in the first exemplary embodiment there is no need for the server side to execute the request certification process. This can lead to reduction in the processing load on the server .

In the exemplary embodiment it is predicated that the certificate managed on the server side the certificate stored in the certificate storage section in the first exemplary embodiment is identical to the certificate managed on the communication terminal the certificate stored in the certificate storage section .

Other exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described below. In the first exemplary embodiment mentioned above the hash value for the certificate is stored in the certification information storage section in the processing step S shown in . This hash value may be calculated from the certificate using a unique hash function or using a fingerprint stored in the certificate. Further it may be calculated using a fingerprint decrypted from an encrypted fingerprint stored in the certificate.

Further although in the first exemplary embodiment the certification information sent from the communication terminal to the server is the hash value for the certificate but it is not limited thereto. The certificate itself may also be sent.

Further although in the first exemplary embodiment when a request is made from the communication terminal the request certification means of the server calculates a hash value for the certificate stored in the certificate storage section in step S shown in but it is not limited thereto. The request certification means may be configured to pre calculate the hash value for the certificate stored in the certificate storage section so as to make only a comparison when the request is made.

Further although in the first exemplary embodiment the request means acquires certification information corresponding to the requesting application from the certification information storage section before sending the request from the communication terminal to the server but it is not limited thereto. It would be enough for the request means to be able to acquire the certification information corresponding to the requesting application. For example since there is an API Application Programming Interface such as getCertificate function to acquire a certificate corresponding to the requesting application the request means may issue this to acquire the certificate calculate a hash value from the certificate and send it to the server . According to this method when the communication terminal executes the application certification process the certification result does not need to be stored in the certification information storage section .

Further in the first exemplary embodiment and the second exemplary embodiment it is predicated that the certificate stored in the certificate storage section of the server will not be updated but this is not limited thereto. Means may be provided to notify the communication terminal of the updated certificate to update the certificate stored in the certificate storage section on the communication terminal . In this case certificate update means may be provided on the communication terminal to provide such a mechanism that the server sends a notification or the communication terminal performs polling periodically to update the certificate stored in the certificate storage section .

Further in the second exemplary embodiment the certificate storage section and the additional certificate storage section are provided separately as shown in but they may be the same storage section as long as they are separated logically. In other words it has just to be configured that the verification means can know whether the application is verified by the originally installed certificate before the request is sent from the communication terminal to the server .

Further in the first exemplary embodiment and the second exemplary embodiment when the communication terminal sends the request to the server the application ID is sent together as illustrated in but it is not limited thereto. The application ID may not be sent as long as the certification information i.e. information on the certificate authority to indicate from which the application has won an endorsement is included in the access request information.

Further in the first exemplary embodiment and the second exemplary embodiment a table is used to associate between the ID of a CA illustrated in and accessible data in the determination on the advisability of access in step S shown in but the association is not limited to this combination. The association may be between an URL and accessible data or a combination of the ID of the CA the URL and the accessible data.

Next the operation of the access control system according to the present invention will be described by using a specific example. In the example description will be made by taking as an example a case where a communication terminal communication terminal executes a web application stored on a web server application server to access data stored on the server server when a web browser installed on the communication terminal is running .

First 1 the application certification process executed by the communication terminal will be described. The user of the communication terminal uses the web browser to access the web server application server perform connection processing . When the URL of the web server starts with https it is indicated that SSL communication is performed and hence a certificate is exchanged between the web server and the communication terminal .

Specifically for example the application certification means uses the certificate sent from the application server and the root certificate stored in the certificate storage section to check whether the web application is authorized by a certificate authority in which the web server is trusted. In this example it is assumed that the URL of the application server and the hash value for the root certificate are stored in the certification information storage section in association with each other on the precondition that the application server is trusted. is an explanatory drawing showing the URL of the web server and the hash value for the certificate stored in the certification information storage section in this example. In this example as shown in https appserver1.com as the URL of the web server and 3jlsdk0d103j0817eub as the hash value for the root certificate are stored in the certification information storage section .

After confirmation of the web application using the root certificate an HTML HyperText Markup Language file of the website is displayed. When the web application is included in this HTML file the web application is executed when the browser is running. Specifically the application execution means executes the web application stored in the application storage section .

Next 2 the request process from the communication terminal to the server will be described. The web application issues the API of the server specifically for example it issues an API key to make a request for data stored in the service storage section of the server . For example an API such as call http appserver3.com getData data is issued to request the server to send data. 

When the web application issues the API the request means detects it specifically for example the request means detects that the application execution means has issued the API key based on the program control of the web application . Then certification information corresponding to the requesting web application actually a server i.e. the application server from which the web application is delivered is fetched from the certification information storage section . The request means sends the server a request specifically for example access request information with this certification information added thereto. is an explanatory drawing showing an example in which the certification information is added to an HTTP request header. In the example shown in referer is set as information on the requesting application and x cert hash is set as the certification information.

Next 3 the request certification process executed by the server will be described. When the request accepting means accepts the request from the communication terminal for example when it receives the access request information sent from the communication terminal the request certification means acquires the certification information from the HTTP header. For example as the method of acquiring the certification information from the HTTP header there is a method of calling an API such as getHTTPHeader referer to acquire the information on the requesting web application and the certification information. The request certification means verifies whether the acquired certification information matches the certificate stored in the certificate storage section .

Here when they do not match the communication terminal recognizes that the requesting application application stored on the application server is a trusted application while the server in the policy of the server recognizes that the application application stored on the application server is an untrusted application. For example it is considered that it happens like this i.e. that the hash value indicated by the certification information sent from the communication terminal does not match the hash value for CA  when the application is certified by a certificate additional certificate added by the user on the communication terminal . In other words when a request specifically for example access request information with a hash value for the additional certificate given thereto is sent since this certificate does not exist on the server side e.g. it is not stored in the certificate storage section of the server it follows that the certificate given to the request does not match the certificate contained in the server in the step of request certification.

Upon completion of the certification process the access control means checks on a policy for CA  for the application having the certificate issued by the CA  . As shown in mentioned above since the policy to allow the application having the certificate issued by the CA  to access data is stored in the policy storage section it is determined that the right of access is given. After that the request accepting means fetches data stored in the service storage section and returns sends to the communication terminal an HTTP response with the data added thereto.

The web application is targeted in this example but it is not limited thereto. For example it can be applied to a JAVA registered trademark application or the like. In this case upon downloading a JAVA application a JAVAVM JAVA Virtual Machine as its execution environment certifies the application and manages the application and a certificate associated with the application. Then when the JAVA application requests a server to send data the JAVAVM detects the request and sends the server the request with hash value for a certificate corresponding to the request added thereto so that the request can be made.

The present invention can also be applied to other applications i.e. it can be applied to a device specific native application an application created in a script language and the like. Further the present invention can be applied to contents as well as the applications i.e. it can be applied to HTML files and the like. In the case of an HTML file when an image file is read with its own tag such as A tag it may include a link to any other site. In this case it is determined on the other site from which HTML file the access is made so that the determination can be used to perform access control related to providing the image file or the like.

Next a general outline of the present invention will be described. is a block diagram showing a general outline of the present invention. As shown in an access control system according to the present invention includes a server corresponding to the server shown in and a communication terminal corresponding to the communication terminal shown in . Then the communication terminal includes terminal certification means corresponding to the application certification means shown in and request means corresponding to the request means shown in . The server includes policy information storage means corresponding to the policy storage section shown in server certification means corresponding to the request certification means shown in access control means corresponding to the access control means shown in and process execution means corresponding to the request accepting means shown in .

The terminal certification means uses an electronic certificate added to a content to execute a certification process on the content and to manage in association with each other the content certified in the certification process and certification information on the content as information based on the electronic certificate to indicate that the content is certified in the certification process.

Upon accessing the server associated with the execution of a content the request means sends the server a request including the certification information on the content and requested content information indicative of a process requested of the server .

The policy information storage means prestores policy information indicating whether to execute the process according to the request based on the certification information and the requested content information included in the request sent from the communication terminal .

The server certification means performs certification on the request based on the certification information included in the request sent from the communication terminal .

When the server certification means certifies the request the access control means decides on whether to execute the process indicated by the requested content information based on the policy information stored in the policy information storage means and the certification information and the requested content information included in the request.

When the access control means decides to execute the process indicated by the requested content information the process execution means executes the process.

According to such a configuration since the request means of the communication terminal sends the server the certification information on the content the server can figure out upon which content the request is based specifically by which certificate authority the content is certified . Then since the access control means of the server decides on whether to execute the process according to the request based on the policy information stored in the policy information storage means access control can be performed based on the policy information stored in the policy information storage means of the server . Thus for example even if the user of the communication terminal adds a certificate and the content is certified by the certificate since access is deniable based on the policy information on the server access unintended by the server is never be made. In other words a policy based on a certificate issued by a predetermined certificate authority is set on the server to enable access control for each content.

In each of the aforementioned exemplary embodiments the following access control systems are also disclosed 

An access control system in which the terminal certification means manages a hash value for an electronic certificate of a content a fingerprint or an electronic certificate itself as certification information on the content in association with the content.

An access control system in which verification means verifies whether an electronic certificate used in a certification process for a content matches an electronic certificate prestored in storage means. According to such a configuration when the communication terminal accesses the server the server can determine whether the content of an access source is certified by a certificate originally installed. This eliminates the need to execute the certification process on the server side enabling reduction in the processing load on the server .

An access control system in which the certification information on the content managed by the terminal certification means in association with the content includes the ID of an issuer of the electronic certificate of the content. An access control system in which an application program is handled as the content.

A configuration in which the communication terminal includes verification means corresponding to the verification means shown in and the server does not include the server certification means is also disclosed as follows 

A communication terminal configured such that upon accessing the server the verification means verifies whether the electronic certificate used in the certification process for the content is a predetermined electronic certificate.

According to such a configuration in addition to the above mentioned effect since it is verified on the communication terminal side whether the electronic certificate used in the certification process for the content is a predetermined electronic certificate there is no need to execute the certification process on the server side. This can lead to reduction in the processing load on the server .

As described above although the present invention is described with reference to the exemplary embodiments and example the present invention is not limited to the aforementioned exemplary embodiments and example. Various changes that can be understood by those skilled in the art within the scope of the present invention can be made to the configurations and details of the present invention.
