title: Catheter systems having flow restrictors
abstract: Infusion catheter systems and methods are described herein that incorporate flow restrictors to balance flow to multiple target sites serviced by delivery catheters. Fluids may be delivered to the target sites using multiple separate delivery catheters or through multiple separate lumens located in the same delivery catheter. Flow balancing may be performed between multiple catheters that are fed from a single fluid source, between multiple separate lumens in a single delivery catheter that are also fed from a single fluid source. Multiple catheters may be fluidly connected to one or more flow restrictors housed within an anchor or in another embodiment, a catheter may be fluidly connected to a restrictor housed in one anchor and another catheter fluidly connected to a second anchor wherein each of the restrictors is also fluidly connected to a single fluid source. Two or more anchors may be fed from a single source, with each anchor containing one or more flow restrictors that feed one, two or more delivery catheters that are attached to each of the anchors (i.e., each anchor may be attached to one, two, three, or more delivery catheters).

The present application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119 of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 146 231 titled CATHETER SYSTEMS HAVING FLOW RESTRICTORS filed on Jan. 21 2009 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Implantable medical devices are described herein and more particularly infusion catheter systems are described herein which incorporate two or more fluid pathways that are flow balanced by the use of two or more flow restrictors.

Implantable infusion systems are used to provide programmable long term delivery of a therapeutic agent e.g. infusate drug to a target site such as the brain or the spinal canal or epidural space. These systems typically include a pump implanted at a remote location e.g. within the abdominal or chest cavity and a catheter tunneled from the pump to the target site. A drug may be delivered from a reservoir in the pump to the target site via the catheter.

Some therapies e.g. treatment of many neurological diseases may benefit from infusion of a therapeutic agent to multiple locations within the body. For instance for the treatment of Parkinson s Disease it may be beneficial to deliver a substance e.g. Glial Derived Neurotrophic Factor GDNF to both hemispheres of the brain bilaterally . Infusing a drug to such multiple target sites can be accomplished by using multiple infusion systems e.g. a separate pump and catheter system with a single exit hole for each target site. However multiple systems result in not only increased costs and patient invasiveness as compared to single target site systems but also increased complexity that is inherent in such multiple systems.

Catheter systems and methods are described herein that incorporate flow restrictors to balance flow to multiple target sites. Fluids may be delivered to the target sites using multiple separate delivery catheters or through multiple separate lumens located in the same delivery catheter. In either case the catheter system includes multiple fluid pathways in which flow balancing is desired. That flow balancing may be performed between multiple catheters that are fed from a single fluid source between multiple separate lumens in a single delivery catheter that are also fed from a single fluid source. In some embodiments multiple catheters may be fluidly connected to one or more flow restrictors housed within an anchor or in another embodiment a catheter may be fluidly connected to a restrictor housed in one anchor and another catheter fluidly connected to a second anchor wherein each of the restrictors is also fluidly connected to a single fluid source. In some embodiments two or more anchors may be fed from a single source with each anchor containing one or more flow restrictors that feed one two or more delivery catheters that are attached to each of the anchors i.e. each anchor may be attached to one two three or more delivery catheters .

In some instances catheter systems and methods described herein may have a main or serial line that feeds or supplies fluid from a single source to multiple parallel lines with the system including a branch point between the serial line and the parallel lines. The multiple parallel lines may be contained within a single delivery catheter that includes multiple separate lumens feeding different target sites. Alternatively the multiple parallel lines may be provided in the form of separate delivery catheters feeding different target sites. The flow restrictors may preferably be located at the branch point i.e. the point at which the flow is converted to parallel flow lines from a common or supply flow line. That branch point may in some embodiments be located in an anchor or anchors used to hold the delivery catheters in place when implanted.

Some embodiments of the systems and methods described herein may include flow restrictors positioned in the anchors used to secure delivery catheters implanted in a patient and positioned to deliver fluids to a predetermined target site in the patient. The flow restrictors are used to restrict flow to the different delivery catheters to control flow to those delivery catheters e.g. to balance the flow to the different delivery catheters . Positioning the flow restrictors in the anchors may be advantageous because the flow restrictors may have a form factor that may be more amenable to placement in the anchors rather than in the delivery catheters. In addition replacement of flow restrictors that may become clogged or otherwise impaired or replacement of the flow restrictors to adjust fluid flow rates into the different delivery catheters may be more easily accomplished by locating the flow restrictors in anchors that may be more easily accessed after initial deployment of the system in a patient.

The words preferred and preferably refer to embodiments of the catheter systems and components that may afford certain benefits under certain circumstances. However other embodiments may also be preferred under the same or other circumstances. Furthermore the recitation of one or more preferred embodiments does not imply that other embodiments are not useful and is not intended to exclude other embodiments from the scope of the invention.

The above summary is not intended to describe each embodiment or every implementation of the catheter systems described herein. Rather a more complete understanding of the invention will become apparent and appreciated by reference to the following Description of Exemplary Embodiments and claims in view of the accompanying figures of the drawing.

In the following detailed description of illustrative embodiments of the systems and methods described herein reference is made to the accompanying figures of the drawing which form a part hereof and in which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the systems and methods described herein may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.

The fluids delivered using the systems and methods described herein preferably contain one or more drugs. A drug as used herein may include a therapeutic substance. Other substances may or may not be intended to have a therapeutic effect and are not easily classified such as e.g. saline solution fluoroscopy agents disease diagnostic agents etc. Unless otherwise noted in the following paragraphs the term drug as used herein may include any therapeutic diagnostic or other substance that is delivered using the implantable systems and methods described herein.

Therapeutic substances delivered using the systems and methods described herein may preferably be intended to have a therapeutic effect such as pharmaceutical compositions genetic materials biologics and other substances. Pharmaceutical compositions are typically chemical foimulations intended to have a therapeutic effect such as intrathecal antispasmodics pain medications chemotherapeutic agents and the like. Pharmaceutical compositions may be configured to function in an implanted environment with characteristics such as stability at body temperature to retain therapeutic qualities concentration to reduce the frequency of replenishment and the like. Genetic materials include substances intended to have a direct or indirect genetic therapeutic effect such as genetic vectors genetic regulator elements genetic structural elements DNA and the like. Biologics include substances that are living matter or derived from living matter intended to have a therapeutic effect such as stem cells platelets hormones biologically produced chemicals and the like.

As used herein and in the appended claims the singular forms a and and the include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus for example reference to a or the component may include one or more of the components and equivalents thereof known to those skilled in the art. Further the term and or means one or all of the listed elements or a combination of any two or more of the listed elements.

It is noted that the term s comprises and variations thereof do not have a limiting meaning where these terms appear in the accompanying description. Moreover a an the at least one and one or more are used interchangeably herein.

Relative terms such as left right forward rearward top bottom side upper lower horizontal vertical and the like may be used herein and if so are from the perspective observed in the particular figure. These terms are used only to simplify the description however and not to limit the scope of the invention in any way.

As used herein the term flow restrictor refers to a resistance that is added to a system to bring the total resistance above a specified value it does not necessarily refer to a singular component. For example two flow restrictors i.e. two components of equal resistance placed in series at the tip of a given catheter could be functionally equivalent to a single flow restrictor whose resistance is twice that of either of the series restrictors taken by itself.

Although the flow restrictors may be used in an attempt to equalize flow rates through the different legs of a branched catheter system the flow restrictors of the present invention may in some instances alternatively provide different flow rates through the different legs by varying the flow restriction provided by the different flow restrictors.

One potential benefit of flow restrictors as used in connection with the systems and methods described herein may be realized with catheter systems that e.g. deliver a substance to two or more separate target areas within a body. Catheter systems may divide flow from a first or proximal catheter to two or more legs to which are coupled secondary or distal catheters e.g. utilizing a Y coupling for a bifurcating catheter system. As a result a single infusion pump may be used to deliver one or more drugs to multiple locations within a body. To provide substantially equal flow to each distal catheter embodiments of the branching catheter systems may provide a flow resistor limiting flow through each leg. The flow restrictor may preferably contribute to balancing flow through each leg.

For simplicity the tubes catheters e.g. supply tube delivery catheter flow restrictor elements e.g. element capillary tubes e.g. capillary tubes fluid pathways e.g. fluid pathways etc. are described herein as being generally cylindrical in shape. However this configuration is not limiting and embodiments having different shapes are certainly possible without departing from the scope of the invention. For example the catheters and flow restrictor elements may include cross sectional profiles that are triangular oval elliptical hexagonal semicircular etc. Further the term diameter may refer to the greatest cross sectional dimension taken perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the component whether it has a circular or non circular cross sectional shape.

The supply tube may define a supply lumen that extends from a proximal end to a distal end. The supply tube may be formed of any medically acceptable material such as ETR silicone polyurethane polyurethane silicone blends or other elastomers etc. Although the supply tube may be flexible in some embodiments it may be provided in the form of a rigid tube manufactured from any suitable material or materials e.g. metals polymers etc. . Also the supply tube may have a varying length and or width depending on the application. For example the supply tube may be two or more times the length of the delivery catheter .

The proximal end of the supply tube may be coupled to the flow restrictor element as further described herein. Although not shown the distal end of the supply tube may be connected to a pump. While not wishing to be bound to any particular configuration the pump may be e.g. a SYNCHROMED II manufactured by Medtronic Inc. of Fridley Minn. USA.

The delivery catheter may define multiple fluid pathways that extend from the proximal end to the distal end. The delivery catheter may be formed of any medically acceptable material such as ETR silicone polyurethane polyurethane silicone blends or other elastomers etc. Although the delivery catheter may be flexible in some embodiments it may be provided in the form of a rigid tube manufactured from any suitable material or materials e.g. metals polymers etc. . Also the delivery catheter may have a varying length e.g. for a larger patient and or width depending on the application. In the embodiment depicted in the delivery catheter includes four fluid pathways with each of the fluid pathways being provided as a separate and distinct lumen in the catheter . However in alternative embodiments the delivery catheter may include more or fewer fluid pathways without departing from the scope of the invention. For example the delivery catheter may have two three five or more fluid pathways.

Each fluid pathway includes an exit opening located at an infusion section along the length of the delivery catheter . When the delivery catheter is inserted into a body each infusion section may correspond to a specific location within the body where fluid is to be dispersed.

The exit openings may be circular triangular oval elliptical hexagonal semicircular etc. Further each exit openings may have the same diameter or a different diameter. The exit openings may be formed by laser ablation molding drilling machining etc.

The distal end of the delivery catheter may be coupled to a cap which may substantially block the distal ends of the fluid pathways to e.g. seal the fluid pathways . The cap may be attached to the delivery catheter by an adhesive melt bonding welding interference fit etc. Further in alternative embodiments the cap may be integral with the delivery catheter . The cap may be formed of any medically acceptable material or materials.

The forward or distal end of the cap depicted in is rounded. However in alternative embodiments the forward end of the cap may be flat conical pyramidal etc. The largest diameter of the cap may be the same diameter of the delivery catheter . In alternative embodiments the largest diameter of the cap may be larger or smaller than the diameter of the delivery catheter .

The rear end of the cap may include a plug portion including individual plugs for each of the fluid passageways . Each plug may be sized relative to its corresponding fluid passageway to provide an interference fit and to substantially block e.g. seal the fluid passageway when attached. In some embodiments the plugs may be tapered or may have any other suitable shape. The rear end of the cap may be constructed of any suitable material or materials e.g. rigid materials such as metals e.g. stainless steel titanium tantalum platinum iridium etc.

As used herein the phrase interference fit refers to the coupling of a male member having a dimension larger than an undeflected or undeformed dimension of a mating female receptacle such that one or both of the male and female members deforms during assembly. As a result a substantially tight and leak free fit under all anticipated flow rates and pressures may be obtained once the parts are assembled.

The proximal end of the delivery catheter may be coupled to the flow restrictor element as further described herein. In this embodiment the flow restrictor element see includes an element body and multiple capillary tubes . It may be preferred that the capillary tubes be located within the same region of the delivery catheter such that the capillary tubes are substantially coextensive with each other although the capillary tubes may have different lengths .

The flow restrictor element body may be made from any medically acceptable material or materials. Examples of some potentially suitable materials may include e.g. ETR silicone polyurethane polyurethane silicone blends or other elastomers etc. Examples of some potentially suitable materials may include e.g. ELASTHANE 80A Nu Sil MED 4870 LSR 65 75 Shore A durometer etc.

The element body may include an enlarged portion that has a diameter that may be the same or larger than the diameter of the supply lumen and or the delivery catheter . The enlarged portion may be operable to abut the supply tube on one side and abut the delivery catheter on the opposite side when the flow restrictor element is coupled to the each of the catheters .

The element body may define one or more capillary apertures each capillary aperture sized to receive a capillary tube . The one or more capillary apertures and capillary tubes may align with the fluid passageways of the delivery catheter . As such each fluid passageway may receive a capillary tube .

The capillary tubes may by coupled within the capillary apertures of the element body and or the lumens in the catheter by any suitable technique e.g. using adhesive melt bonding welding interference fit etc. One potential technique may include e.g. slip fitting a capillary tube into an oversized capillary aperture in the element body and or lumen fluid passageway of the catheter following by re flowing one or more of the components to fix the capillary tube in position and force fluid to pass through the capillary tube rather than around the capillary tube .

The capillary tubes may be formed of any medically acceptable material such as ETR silicone polyurethane polyurethane silicone blends or other elastomers glasses e.g. fused silica etc. metals etc. In at least one embodiment the capillary tubes may be fused silica capillary restrictors that have a length of about 4 inches 102 millimeters and an inside diameter of about 0.0012 inches 30 microns .

The capillary tubes may have a length such that they extend through the element body and a portion of the delivery catheter . In the capillary tubes extend into the delivery catheter about half the length of the delivery catheter . However in other embodiments the capillary tubes may be longer or shorter relative to the delivery catheter than shown in . For example the capillary tubes may extend through the entire length of the delivery catheter to the plugs of the cap or the capillary tubes may only extend into a small portion of the delivery catheter . In at least one embodiment the capillary tubes may have a length of about 0.5 inches 13 millimeters to about 1.5 inches 38 millimeters .

The capillary tubes function as flow restrictors e.g. the capillary tubes provide flow resistance and thus backpressure so that a pressure sensor located upstream e.g. in an infusion pump can be utilized to detect cuts or occlusions between the capillary tube and the pump. That is by creating a measurable pressure in lumen of the supply tube upstream of the capillary tubes variations in that backpressure may potentially be utilized to predict occlusions increased pressure or leaks decreased pressure .

The length and inner diameters of the capillary tubes may be selected to obtain desired flow characteristics. For example the cross sectional openings within the capillary tubes and their lengths may be selected to obtain desired flow characteristics based on e.g. flow rates fluid viscosity the materials of the capillary tubes etc.

Because the back pressure created by the capillary tubes is sensitive to tolerance variations in the capillary tube construction the capillary tubes used in any one catheter system may be flow matched i.e. each capillary tube may have the same flow characteristics e.g. each capillary tube may have the same flow rate at a given pressure for the same fluid . The flow matching may result in the use of capillary tubes within the same catheter system that have different lengths provided that the flow restrictions provided by the different capillary tubes have the same flow characteristics.

The system may include a filter element a feed catheter an anchor and delivery catheters . Although not depicted as a part of the catheter system described with respect to it may be preferred to include a filter element upstream of the flow restrictors in any catheter system of the present invention to reduce the likelihood that particles may Occlude flow through the flow restrictor and or change the flow restriction provided by the flow restrictor by e.g. partially blocking the flow restrictor .

The filter element may include a pin portion for connecting to a device e.g. a pump implanted in an abdominal region of a patient. The pin portion may include ramped flanges to further secure the filter element to the fluid apparatus. The filter element may define a bore through the pin portion and into the filter portion .

The feed catheter may extend to an anchor which e.g. may be attached to the skull of a patient. The anchor may then couple the feed catheter to the delivery catheters each of which e.g. may be inserted into a specific region of the patient for fluid delivery to those specific regions.

Although the embodiment depicted in includes a bifurcating catheter system the present invention may include catheter systems with three or more branches. In other variations although the depicted system is implanted for delivery into the brain of a patient it should be understood that catheter systems of the present invention may be used to deliver fluids to other areas of the body.

A filter may preferably be attached to or integrally formed with the filter element . In one embodiment the filter element may preferably be made from titanium with the filter being a sintered titanium member welded to the element .

The capillary tubes may by coupled within the portion of the element and or the lumens in the feed catheter by any suitable technique e.g. using adhesive melt bonding welding interference fit etc. One potential technique may include e.g. slip fitting a capillary tube into an oversized lumen fluid passageway of the catheter following by re flowing one or more of the components to fix the capillary tubes in position and force fluid to pass through the capillary tubes rather than around the capillary tubes .

The feed catheter may further include a strain relief sleeve that may extend over a portion of the flow restrictor element and a portion of the feed catheter to e.g. provide further support to the feed catheter . The strain relief sleeve may be tapered with its largest diameter surrounding the flow restrictor element as shown. In this embodiment the strain relief sleeve and the feed catheter may be separate pieces. In other embodiments the strain relief sleeve may be integral with the feed catheter .

The second gasket may be substantially the same as the first gasket and may abut restrictor on one side and abut the catheter connection pin on its other side so as to provide a seal between the restrictor and the catheter connection pin .

The catheter connection pin may define a bore and include an enlarged portion which e.g. may be about the same size as the first and second gaskets and or the restrictor . The retaining clip holds the catheter connection pin first and second gaskets and the restrictor together to substantially seal the connection to the connector .

An anchor assembly that may be used to secure delivery catheters of the catheter systems described herein with respect to a burr hole formed in a patient s skull are described in commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 357 120 entitled BURR HOLE ANCHORS SYSTEMS AND METHODS filed on Jan. 21 2009 which application is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety to the extent it does not conflict with the disclosure presented herein. The burr hole anchor assemblies described therein form part of a system for infusing a therapeutic agent into the patient s brain via an intraparenchymal IPA or intracerbroventricular ICV delivery catheter that passes through a burr hole formed in the skull. The catheter systems described in connection with the anchor assembly embodiments will include supply or feed catheters and delivery catheters each of which may be formed of any medically acceptable material such as ETR silicone polyurethane polyurethane silicone blends or other elastomers etc. While the catheters may be flexible in some embodiments all or a portion thereof may be provided in the form of a rigid tube manufactured from any suitable material or materials e.g. metals polymers etc. .

The anchor may include a base and a module or insert that together form a body of the anchor. The anchor e.g. the base may be secured to selected tissue at a selected location via any acceptable method e.g. sutures tissue anchors bone screws etc. . In the case of a burr hole anchor surrounding a burr hole on the outer surface of the skull the anchor may be secured using e.g. bone screws not shown extending through openings formed through the base . Although the anchor may be designed for use as a burr hole anchor where the anchor body is operable to be secured to bone tissue surrounding a burr hole in patient s skull the anchors used in the systems described herein may include anchor body that is operable to be secured to selected tissue at any selected location on or in a patient. The selected tissue to which the anchor may be secured may include bone tissue soft tissue etc.

The body of the anchor may further include a supply catheter feed pin which in one embodiment extends outwardly from a peripheral edge of the anchor body e.g. from the insert . The feed pin may include a tubular male member that may be received within the lumen of the supply catheter .

The anchor may further include a catheter cutting or shearing mechanism . In one embodiment the mechanism is formed at least in part by a door pivotally attached to the body e.g. the base and having a shearing edge described in more detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 357 120 entitled BURR HOLE ANCHORS SYSTEMS AND METHODS filed on Jan. 21 2009.

The anchor body includes cavities and in which flow restrictors and are located. The cavities and may be open on the bottom surface of the anchor body to allow for removal and replacement of the flow restrictors and in the anchor body . Although access to the flow restrictors and in the depicted embodiment is through openings in the bottom surface of the anchor body the cavities and in the anchor body may also or alternatively open on the top surface of the anchor body i.e. the surface depicted in with the cavities covered by a cap . Anchor bodies with cavities that allow access to the flow restrictors located therein through the top surface of the anchor assembly to further facilitate their removal and replacement without requiring removal of the anchor body from its secured location.

The anchor body may include a connector that separates the flow into the anchor into two streams with a first stream flowing to the first flow restrictor and a second stream flowing to the second flow restrictor . The connector includes a first exit port connected to the inlet port of the first flow restrictor by tubing and a second exit port connected to the inlet port of the second flow restrictor by tubing . The other ports and respectively of the first and second restrictors are in fluid connection with a first and second delivery catheter as described herein not shown in .

Although a connector in the form of a manifold that is separate and discrete from the anchor body and tubes and is used to distribute flow in the depicted embodiment to the inlet ports of the flow restrictors located in the catheter body other embodiments may use any other suitable connector to distribute the incoming fluid to two or more different fluid paths. The connectors used to distribute flow from e.g. supply tube supply catheter etc. to two or more different fluid paths as described herein may be provided in any suitable form e.g. a discrete manifold that includes one or more supply ports and two or more exit ports a Y fitting a T fitting a cavity formed in an anchor body with the cavity including one or more supply ports and two or more exit ports etc.

In some embodiments the distribution of flow from the inlet to the first and second delivery catheters not shown in is controlled by the flow restrictors and . In some embodiments the flow through the flow restrictors and may be substantially equal while in other embodiments the flow may be distributed unequally but in a selected ration e.g. 60 through one flow restrictor and 40 through the other flow restrictor 75 through one flow restrictor and 25 through the other flow restrictor etc.

Also although the connector and the flow restrictors and are in the depicted embodiment provided as separate and discrete articles in some embodiments two or more flow restrictors may be integrated into a connector assembly such as e.g. the system depicted in . Such an integrated connector and flow restrictors may in some embodiments be located within an anchor as described herein to both distribute and control e.g. balance fluid flow from a single supply source to two or more delivery catheters.

One embodiment of a catheter system including two anchors is depicted in . In the depicted embodiment each of the anchors may be used to distribute flow from a single fluid source e.g. a pump or other source of therapeutic agent to one or more delivery catheters extending from the anchors . The flow from fluid source to the anchors may be delivered by a supply tube that directs flow into a supply port of connector e.g. a connector that in this embodiment is in the form of a T fitting with a first portion of the fluid passing through the connector to the anchor through an exit port of the connector and a second portion of the flow passing to the second anchor through a supply tube connected to another exit port of the connector .

The connector may as in the depicted embodiment be attached to the anchor while the supply tube fluidly connects the second anchor to the first anchor to form a daisy chain system of anchors that are fed from a single fluid source. Each of the anchors may be used to feed and connect one or more delivery catheters such that in one multi anchor embodiment the system includes two anchors with each anchor feeding one delivery catheter.

In the embodiment depicted in the system includes two pairs of delivery catheters with each pair of delivery catheters being connected to the components in the anchors such that fluid from source is distributed to the delivery catheters in manner dictated by the flow restrictors deployed within the infusion catheter system. As discussed herein in some embodiments those flow restrictors may be advantageously located in the anchors . In some embodiments one anchor e.g. anchor may preferably include two flow restrictors each of which distributes flow to a separate delivery catheter attached to the anchor and the second anchor may preferably include two flow restrictors each of which distributes flow to a separate delivery catheter attached to the anchor .

Although the embodiment of an infusion catheter system depicted in includes two anchors that are each connected to a separate pair of delivery catheters other embodiments may include three or more anchors. In another variation each of the anchors may be used to deliver fluid to any selected number of delivery catheters . For example anchor may be connected to only one delivery catheter or three or more delivery catheters depending on the needs of a user.

By employing a separate flow restrictor located upstream of each of the delivery catheters relative fluid flow into each of the delivery catheters may be controlled. For example if the flow restrictors used to feed each of the four delivery catheters depicted in are selected to provide substantially equivalent flow restrictions then the fluid flow to each of the delivery catheters may be substantially equal e.g. approximately 25 of the flow from the source would be delivered to each of the delivery catheters assuming that all other flow restrictions in each fluid path are equal and or insignificant as compared to the flow restriction provided by the flow restrictors . Other distributions of fluid flow between the delivery catheters may be achieved by selecting flow restrictors that provide different levels of flow restriction.

Each of the delivery catheters used in a system such as that depicted in may include one or more delivery lumens that extend through the delivery catheters to one or more infusion locations along the delivery catheter. The delivery catheters may be funned of any medically acceptable material such as ETR silicone polyurethane polyurethane silicone blends or other elastomers etc. Although the delivery catheters may be flexible in some embodiments they may be provided in the form of a rigid tube manufactured from any suitable material or materials e.g. metals polymers etc. .

The components of the flow restrictor may in some embodiments be housed in a length of medical tubing e.g. urethane tubing although other housings could also be used. Flow inlet of the flow restrictor may be defined by a tube having a lumen and may be coupled to e.g. a supply catheter through a connector as depicted in . Flow outlet may be defined by a tube having a lumen and may be e.g. connected to a delivery catheter or a delivery catheter connector as discussed herein. In the embodiment shown the flow restrictor includes a body that defines an orifice through which the fluid being restricted flows. The body may in some embodiments be in the form of a disc shaped ruby body. In some embodiments the bodies used in a flow restrictor such as restrictor may have a thickness of 0.010 inch 0.001 inch 0.25 millimeters 0.25 millimeters and include a generally circular orifice forming an opening having an inner diameter of 0.0004 inch 0.0002 inch a 10 micron inner diameter. If the body is in the form of a disc it may in some embodiments have an outside diameter of 0.060 inch 0.0005 inch 1.5 millimeters 0.013 millimeters .

The flow restrictor may also include a filter located between the body and the flow inlet such that it is located upstream of the body in the intended use of the flow restrictor . The filter may be e.g. a porous 2 micron titanium filter although any filter with suitable characteristics may be used.

The flow restrictor is described herein as having a housing with a flattened shape that includes two opposed major exterior surfaces defined by the base and lid see e.g. where each of the major exterior surfaces is significantly larger than the thickness or height defined by the side surface that extend between the two opposed major exterior surfaces. Flow restrictors with a flattened shape may be well suited for use in a cavity formed in an anchor as described herein by providing the desired flow restriction in a form factor that complements the low profile shape of the anchor in which it is located. In some embodiments a flow restrictor with a flattened shape may form rectangular prismatic body such as e.g. the flow restrictor which although including rounded edges is generally in the shape of a rectangular prism .

Flow restrictor includes a chip assembly that is formed by a first substrate and a second substrate . The term chip assembly is used as it is formed in a similar fashion as that of forming a microchip. The substrates and may be constructed of e.g. glass silicon or any other suitable material. The first substrate has a first surface and a second surface . The second substrate also has a first surface and a second surface . The first surface of the first substrate is positioned such that it faces the first surface of the second substrate . The first and second surfaces of the first and second substrates and may preferably be planar. It may be preferred that the first surface of the first substrate has a shape that is complementary to the first surface of the second substrate e.g. both surfaces may be planar one surface may be convex and the other concave etc. .

A continuous channel is provided on the first surface of the second substrate . When mated with the first substrate the channel provides a feature through which the fluid to be restricted flows. The amount of fluid e.g. therapeutic agent or drug that will flow through the restrictor can be varied by varying the size e.g. depth width etc. and length of the channel . In addition more than one channel can be provided. The channel may be formed by any suitable technique and or combination of techniques e.g. machining etching wet or dry scribing etc. In some embodiments the first surface of substrate which faces the surface in which channel is formed may be flat or featureless while in other embodiments the facing surface may also include features provided to help control fluid flow through the chip assembly.

Fluid is in the depicted embodiment delivered to the channel through a first opening that extends through the first substrate from the first surface to the second surface . Similarly a second opening extends through the substrate from the surface to the second surface . One or both of these openings may alternatively be formed in the second substrate i.e. the substrate that also contains the channel . The openings and are preferably aligned such that they expose a portion of the channel . If the channel and the opening s are located in the same substrate the channel preferably intersects or extends into the opening.

Some potentially useful dimensions for the channel may for example be a channel depth of 15 microns a channel width of 80 microns and a channel length of about 45 millimeters. The overall length of the substrates in which the channel and its mating surface are formed may be e.g. 0.250 inch 6.35 millimeters with a width of 0.100 inch 2.5 millimeters . All of these dimensions are exemplary only in other words they may be changed to achieve a desired flow rate pressure drop etc.

The opening in substrate of the depicted embodiment of flow restrictor is proximate the inlet port . The inlet port is in fluid communication via opening with the channel formed in the substrate . A filter may be provided in the flow path between the channel and the inlet to capture particulates that could potentially clog or obstruct the channel . In one embodiment the filter may have a micron rating of 5 microns. As depicted in e.g. the flow restrictor may also include a compression seal located in the flow restrictor to help control fluid flow through the restrictor.

Other flow restrictors including chip assemblies that may potentially be used in the catheter systems described herein are described in commonly assigned U.S. Published Pat. App. No. 2007 0043335 A1 entitled MINIATURE PUMP FOR DRUG DELIVERY.

Another embodiment of the invention includes a method of delivering fluids from a single source through two or more delivery catheters or delivery pathways to two or more predetermined target locations in a patient s brain comprising the steps of connecting a proximal end of each delivery catheter directly or indirectly to a flow restrictor positioned in an anchor used to anchor the implanted delivery catheter in place wherein the flow restrictor is also fluidly connected to a supply catheter and is located in the flow path from the fluid source to the delivery of fluid from the delivery catheter at the target location.
