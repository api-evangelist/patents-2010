This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Applications No. 61 157 063 filed Mar. 3 2009. This application is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.

This invention was made with United States Government support under Contract Number W911QX 04 C 0097 awarded by the United States Army. The United States Government has certain rights in this invention.

The invention relates to three dimensional matrix for micro machined coaxial components and more particularly to such a matrix wherein the coaxial components are disposed within a periodic matrix and routing grid.

Known supporting structures fail to facilitate stacking of multiple layers of coaxial line and access to both sides of a particular layer. A mechanically sound superstructure is required to capture components and RF transmission lines in a uniform assembly without adding further complexity to the fabrication process.

A known method for containing securing micro machined components illustrated in was to use a host substrate that through direct adhesion keeps the components in place. As illustrated in a section of coaxial line is mounted directly to a substrate which provides it with support on one side.

The principal disadvantage of this known method is that the substrate prevents the stacking of formed components and blocks access to the lower surface of the components since these are adhered to the substrate to fix them in place. Further if the securing substrate were removed the arrangement of the coaxial lines though weakly connected would not have the mechanical integrity needed for typical handling and assembly operations.

Clearly what is needed therefore is a method and system for securing and stacking formed components within a three dimensional matrix that provides mechanical strength and security and permits access to components from the lower surface of the matrix.

One embodiment of the present invention provides a system for three dimensional coaxial transmissions of signals in a micro machined component the system comprising a first micro machined component matrix comprising a first metallic sheet having a plurality of first access holes disposed therein a second metallic sheet having a plurality of second access holes disposed therein a plurality of metal posts disposed between the first and second metallic sheets such that the metallic sheets are maintained at a desired distance walls defining a coaxial transmission channel the walls being disposed between the first and second metallic sheets perpendicularly to the first and second metallic sheets a coaxial transmission core disposed within the channel.

A yet further embodiment of the present invention provides such a system further comprising a coaxial transmission core hole in the second sheet through which the coaxial transmission core passed to a space disposed between the second and third sheets.

Even another embodiment of the present invention provides such a system further comprising a plurality of the matrices that are electrically coupled to each other.

An even further embodiment of the present invention provides such a system wherein the metallic sheets are copper.

Yet still another embodiment of the present invention provides such a system wherein the metal posts are copper.

A yet still further embodiment of the present invention provides such a system further comprising a second micro machined component matrix disposed proximate to the first micro machined component matrix.

Still even another embodiment of the present invention provides such a system wherein a face of the first metallic sheet of the first micro machined component matrix is disposed proximate to a face of a first sheet of the second micro machined component matrix.

A still even further embodiment of the present invention provides such a system wherein an edge of the first micro machined component matrix is disposed proximate to an edge of the second micro machined component matrix.

A further embodiment of the present invention provides such a matrix wherein the columns are positioned such that the columns are disposed between the access holes.

The features and advantages described herein are not all inclusive and in particular many additional features and advantages will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the drawings specification and claims. Moreover it should be noted that the language used in the specification has been principally selected for readability and instructional purposes and not to limit the scope of the inventive subject matter.

One embodiment of the present invention utilizes stripline or tri plate transmission line medium utilizing upper and lower metal planes. One can then replace the core dielectric which provides the mechanical integrity with an arrangement of metal posts connected to the top middle and lower plates of the matrix to provide the rigidity somewhat like a honey comb laminate.

One embodiment of the present invention provides a method of embedding the components in a superstructure allows both stacking and surface access to the core of the coaxial component . As illustrated in sheets separated by an array of posts are provided comprising a matrix superstructure . This matrix superstructure is compatible with a process that forms the core or center conductor and side walls of component to be mounted therein thereby simplifying the construction process of both the components and the matrix. In one embodiment of the present invention the sheets side walls and posts may be configured from metal or other suitable conductive material and may according to one such embodiment be manufactured through a series of micromachining techniques such as that performed under the service mark POLYSTRATA by Nuvotronics of Radford VA. Such processes are known to those skilled in the art. One skilled in the art will appreciate that other materials with suitable conductivity may be used.

As illustrated in a center conductor and side walls of the structure are disposed between the top middle and bottom sheets of the matrix. These sheets provide both mechanical and electrical function. In such an embodiment the matrices are stacked and posts disposed so as to span the vertical distance between the lower sheet and middle sheet not shown . These posts are also arranged on the same pitch as the matrix release holes and appear at every intersection of the matrix that does not have component metal there already e.g. transmission line side wall .

A lower matrix sheet of one embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in providing a plurality of access holes in the sheet and correspond to access holes in the transmission line side walls . These holes disposed in the side walls of the transition line are necessary to chemically remove sacrificial material used in the device construction. Posts support and separate sheets . Such a configuration provides a uniform periodicity of the holes in the matrix sheet which is in turn reflected in the uniform periodicity of the holes disposed in the side walls of the transition line and allows the transmission line components including center elements to be laid out on a regular grid. One skilled in the art will appreciate that this provides a convenient mechanism for layout of large complex circuits. In one embodiment of the present invention the sheet configuration provides a 50 fill for the grid e.g. 250 um wide holes on a 500 um pitch one skilled in the art will appreciate that alternative embodiments may be made having differing fill ratios within the present invention. As illustrated in the posts located in the interior of the panel are equidistantly disposed from four proximate access holes in one sheet and four proximate second access holes in a second sheet .

In one embodiment illustrated in a plurality of such structures are joined so that a conductive center element may continue through a plurality of layers. The matrix sheets posts and holes are arrayed such that they are aligned as shown in between matrices and such that the line may conduct transmissions between the sections.

The foregoing description of the embodiments of the invention has been presented for the purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. Many modifications and variations are possible in light of this disclosure. It is intended that the scope of the invention be limited not by this detailed description but rather by the claims appended hereto.
