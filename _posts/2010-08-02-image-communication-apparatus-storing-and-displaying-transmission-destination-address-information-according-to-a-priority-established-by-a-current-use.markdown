This nonprovisional application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 a on Patent Application No. 2009 180623 filed in Japan on Aug. 3 2009 the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.

The present invention relates to an image communication apparatus represented by a facsimile apparatus in which facsimile numbers and or mail addresses of transmission destinations are registered in an address book in advance and a destination is designated using the address book at the time of transmission. More specifically the present invention relates to an image communication apparatus capable of appropriately managing an address book no matter whether it is a shared address book or a personal address book personal address book of each logged in user .

It has become increasingly common to connect an image forming apparatus having a printer function or a copy function to a network to allow use by a plurality of users. Further the number of apparatuses having a plurality of modes such as a copy mode an image communication mode typically a facsimile mode hereinafter facsimile may also be denoted as FAX or fax a network supported printer mode and a scanner mode such as MFPs multi function peripherals is increasing. The image communication mode includes the facsimile communication mode of transmitting receiving image data using public line an Internet facsimile communication mode of transmitting receiving image data using Internet connection an electronic mail communication mode of transmitting receiving image data as an attachment to an electronic mail scan to mail an image transfer mode of transferring image data to a storage inside of the MFP and an image transfer mode scan to folder of transferring image data to a specific folder using a network line.

In such an MFP in order to simplify user s operation and to prevent misdirection it is a common practice to register a destination name display name and a FAX number and or mail address as a speed dial or an abbreviated dial and to designate a destination using the speed dial or the abbreviated dial at the time of transmission.

Recent MFPs come to have larger storage capacity and allows registration of a huge number of destinations in an address book. It is often the case that such an MFP is shared by a number of users and when shared the address book is often shared when an MFP is shared it is also common to use a personal address for each logged in user . No matter whether one address book is shared in an MFP used by a number of users or personal address books are used in a shared MFP if the number of addresses registered in the address book increases it becomes necessary to search for a desired address from a large number of addresses. Hence it becomes difficult to designate a destination. In such a case it is necessary for an administrator for a shared address book and for the user of each personal address book to maintain the address book and to delete addresses not used not designated as destinations for a long time.

Though not directly related to such maintenance of address books Japanese Patent Laying Open No. 7 13732 hereinafter referred to as 732 Reference discloses a method of display letting the user know that an icon indicating a program or indicating a combination of a program and data has not been used for a long time in an information processing system such as a personal computer. According to the icon display method disclosed in 732 Reference icons are displayed on a display screen. When a user selectively designates a displayed icon information corresponding to the icon is designated. According to the display method elapsed time after the last designation of an icon is measured. If the counted time exceeds a first specific time the manner of display of the icon is changed to give an alarm. Further if the measured time exceeds a second specific time longer than a first specific time the alarm displayed icon is erased from the display screen.

According to the icon display method the user can grasp information icon not used for a prescribed elapse time. Further since display of an icon that is not used can be erased from the display screen the display screen can be used efficiently.

The icon display method disclosed in 732 Reference however has the following problem. Specifically the icon that is not used is eventually not displayed on the display screen. If the user wishes to use the icon again it is necessary to form the icon again. In other words simply by deleting information icon that is not used for a prescribed time period from the display screen it is impossible to appropriately meet the demand of the user to use the icon again.

Even when such a method of icon display is applied to maintenance of an address book what is attained is only an erasure of an address that has not been used for a long time. After an icon is erased it becomes impossible to designate it as a destination and it becomes necessary to register it again or to directly input a facsimile number or a mail address. Thus it is impossible in the image transmission process to simplify user s operation or to prevent misdirection.

Therefore it is desirable to provide an image communication apparatus in which facsimile numbers and or mail addresses are registered in an address book in advance and when a transmission destination is to be designated by speed dial or abbreviated dial designation of a transmission destination is made easier using the address book as well as to provide an image forming apparatus including such a communication apparatus. It is also desirable to have the address book maintained appropriately reflecting the use history of each user.

According to an aspect the present invention provides an image communication apparatus having a plurality of destinations registered in advance and transmitting image data to an address designated from said plurality of destinations as a transmission destination. The image communication apparatus includes a storage device storing destination information used by the image communication apparatus to identify the destination and frequency of use of the destination as a transmission destination a destination display device displaying the plurality of destinations registered in advance in the storage device giving higher priority to a destination having high frequency of use than a destination having low frequency a designating device connected to the destination display device allowing a user to designate a transmission destination from a plurality of destinations displayed by the destination display device an image data transmitting device connected to the designating device for transmitting image data to a transmission destination designated by the designating device and a display changing device connected to the storage device and the destination display device for changing if an address stored in the storage device and having low frequency of use and displayed without priority is designated as a transmission destination a manner of display by the display device to display the address with priority.

In the image communication apparatus at least one destination is designated as a transmission destination from among a plurality of destinations address book stored in advance as candidate of transmission destinations in case of multicast transmission a plurality of transmission destinations are designated . Here the plurality of destinations are displayed with frequently used ones given higher priority to less frequently used ones. Therefore it is easier to designate a destination that is frequently used. Even a destination that is not frequently used and displayed with low priority may be designated as a transmission destination. In such a case the manner of display of low priority corresponding to the low frequency is changed to a manner of display with high priority. Therefore once a destination that has been displayed with low priority as it is not used frequently is designated as a transmission destination the destination comes to be displayed with high priority. Since a destination designated as a transmission destination is always displayed with priority it is easy to designate a destination. In addition even a destination not frequently used can be designated as a transmission destination and once designated as a transmission destination it can be displayed with high priority. As a result when facsimile numbers and or mail addresses are registered in advance and a transmission destination is to be designated using speed dial or abbreviated dial the address book storing a plurality of destinations is maintained appropriately reflecting the use history of the user and hence an image communication apparatus allowing the user to easily designate a transmission destination can be provided.

Preferably the storage device includes a first area for storing information related to a destination having the high frequency and a second area for storing information related to a destination having the low frequency. The destination display device includes a hierarchical display device displaying the plurality of destinations registered in advance in the storage device in a hierarchical manner with a destination stored in the first area displayed on an upper layer than a destination stored in the second area. The display changing device includes an area changing device for changing if a destination stored in the second area and displayed on a lower layer is designated as a transmission destination the destination to be stored in the first area.

Information of a destination that is frequently designated as a transmission destination is stored in a first area and information of a destination that is not frequently designated as a transmission destination is stored in a second area. The destination stored in the first area is displayed on a layer upper than the destination stored in the second area. The destination stored in the first area which is more frequently designated as a transmission destination can be displayed with priority on a higher layer.

The display changing device may include a display manner changing device for changing the manner of display based on restore conditions if a destination of low frequency is designated as a transmission destination. Here the restore conditions may be related to how many times a destination is designated as a transmission destination. The restore conditions may be related to how many times a logged in user designated the destination as the transmission destination. The restore conditions may be related to the user who designated the destination as a transmission destination.

The restore condition related to how many times a destination of low frequency is designated as a transmission destination and the restore condition related to the user who designated the destination as the transmission destination are set. If a destination is designated a desired number of times as the transmission destination or if it is designated by a specific user as the transmission destination the manner of display is automatically changed so that the destination is displayed with priority. Therefore maintenance by the user is unnecessary.

According to another aspect the image forming apparatus in accordance with the present invention includes any of the above described image communication apparatuses.

When a transmission destination for transmitting an image is designated from a plurality of destinations in the image communication apparatus included in the image forming apparatus the plurality of destinations are displayed with frequently used ones given higher priority to less frequently used ones. Therefore it is easier to designate a destination that is frequently used. If a destination that is not frequently used and displayed with low priority is designated as a transmission destination the manner of display of low priority corresponding to the low frequency is changed to a manner of display with high priority. Therefore once a destination that has been displayed with low priority as it is not used frequently is designated as a transmission destination the destination comes to be displayed with high priority. Since a destination designated as a transmission destination is always displayed with priority it is easy to designate a destination. In addition even a destination not frequently used can be designated as a transmission destination and once designated as a transmission destination it can be displayed with high priority.

In the image communication apparatus and the image forming apparatus including the same in accordance with the present invention when facsimile numbers and or mail addresses are registered in advance and a transmission destination is to be designated using speed dial or abbreviated dial the address book storing a plurality of destinations is maintained appropriately reflecting the use history of the user and hence it becomes easier for the user to designate a transmission destination.

The foregoing and other objects features aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

In the following description the same components are denoted by the same reference characters. Their functions and names are also the same. Therefore detailed description thereof will not be repeated. In the following description it is assumed that the image forming apparatus in accordance with the present invention is an MFP. The present invention however is not limited to an MFP and it may be applicable to any apparatus that can use an address book and attains the function of an image communication mode facsimile communication mode Internet facsimile communication mode electronic mail communication mode scan to mail and the like for exchanging image data. Therefore an MFP having only the image communication mode that does not form any image but simply transmits an image may be encompassed by the image forming apparatus here. In the following description facsimile fax and FAX are used not specifically distinguished from each other.

Referring to an image forming apparatus as the image communication apparatus in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention includes a document reading unit an image forming unit a paper feed unit and a discharge processing device .

In the following an operation in the facsimile communication mode will be described for describing an internal configuration of image forming apparatus . In the facsimile communication mode also referred to as a facsimile image transmission mode a document reading unit scanner unit and FAX communication unit mainly operate for the transmitting operation and FAX communication unit and an image forming unit mainly operate for the receiving operation whereby the facsimile communication operation is realized. The operations in the Internet facsimile function and the electronic mail transmission function scan to mail are substantially similar in the sense that image data is the object of communication though the destination is not a FAX number but a computer address or a mail address and the communication interface is not FAX communication unit but network IF .

In image forming apparatus when a user designates the facsimile image transmission mode designates a destination and presses a start button a document placed on a platen is read as image data by document reading unit . The read image data is input to CPU Central Processing Unit shown in formed of a microcomputer or the like and the image data is subjected to various image processing operations. The resulting image data is output to the FAX communication unit . When designating an address it is possible to designate an address facsimile number or mail address here a facsimile number registered in advance using a shared address book or a personal address book.

FAX communication unit of image forming apparatus on the transmitting side connects a line to a designated transmission destination converts the image data to communication data in compliance with facsimile transmission standard and transmits the converted data to a facsimile machine on the receiving side for example image forming apparatus having the facsimile function .

When the line is connected FAX communication unit of image forming apparatus on the receiving side detects a communication request signal from FAX communication unit of image forming apparatus on the transmitting side and transmits an acknowledgement signal. Thereafter by way of example FAX communication units of the transmitting side and receiving side pass performance information supported by each other determine highest possible speed of communication and method of coding code correction of image data and set the method of communication of modems. Then using the image signal format in accordance with the communication method data is transmitted from FAX communication unit of image forming apparatus on the transmitting side to FAX communication unit of image forming apparatus on the receiving side. When transmission ends the line is disconnected.

FAX communication unit of image forming apparatus on the receiving side converts the received data to image data and passes the data to image forming unit . A configuration in which the received data is converted to image data by image forming unit is also possible.

Image forming unit is for printing an image of the document represented by the image data on a recording medium and it includes by way of example a photoreceptor drum a charger a laser scanning unit hereinafter also denoted as LSU a developer a transfer device a cleaning device a fixing device and a neutralizer not shown.

Photoreceptor drum rotates in one direction and its surface is cleaned by cleaning device and the neutralizer and thereafter uniformly charged by charger .

LSU modulates the laser beam based on the image data to be printed and repeatedly scans the surface of photoreceptor drum with the laser beam in a main scanning direction whereby an electrostatic latent image is formed on the surface of photoreceptor drum .

Developer develops the electrostatic latent image by supplying toner to the surface of photoreceptor drum and thus a toner image is formed on the surface of photoreceptor drum .

Transfer device transfers the toner image on the surface of photoreceptor drum to the sheet of recording paper passing between transfer device and the photoreceptor drum .

Fixing device includes a heating roller for heating the sheet of recording paper and a pressure roller for pressing the sheet of recording paper. As the sheet of recording paper is heated by heating roller and pressed by pressure roller the toner image that has been transmitted to the recording paper is fixed on the sheet of recording paper.

At a position of connection between main feeding path and reverse feeding path a separation pawl is arranged. When printing is done only on one side of the sheet of recording paper separation pawl is so positioned that the sheet of recording paper fed from fixing device is guided to paper discharge tray or to discharge processing device .

When printing is done on both sides of the sheet of recording paper separation pawl is turned to a prescribed direction so that the sheet of recording paper is guided to reverse feeding path . The sheet of recording paper passes through reverse feeding path turned upside down and again fed to main feeding path and while it is again fed along main feeding path printing is done on its rear surface and the sheet is guided to discharge tray or to discharge processing device .

The sheet of recording paper on which printing is done in the above described manner is guided to discharge tray or to discharge processing device and discharged to discharge tray or to any of the discharge trays of discharge processing device .

Further an address registered in the address book is displayed on display panel . On a display area of liquid crystal display device of display panel selection buttons are displayed. When a portion where the selection button is displayed is pressed the pressed position is detected by the touch panel. By comparing the display position of the selection button and the position where the touch panel is pressed using a program setting of a function or instruction of an operation of image forming apparatus becomes possible.

In image forming apparatus in accordance with the present embodiment information destination name destination facsimile number destination mail address of a transmission destination to which a facsimile is to be transmitted or a transmission destination to which image data is transmitted by mail is registered in the address book in advance and the transmission destination can be designated by speed dial or abbreviate dial. For this purpose in hard disk or RAM an address registration table having such fields as shown in is stored.

Referring to the address registration table in which a registration number Reg. No. for each address is used as a key at least includes a field for storing a display name of an address a field for storing a facsimile number of the address a field for storing a mail address of the address a field for storing a flag hereinafter referred to as a publication flag indicating whether or not the address is made public whether or not it should be posted on the shared address book a flag hereinafter referred to as a save flag indicating whether or not the address is to be saved whether or not the address should be moved to a save folder if save conditions are satisfied and a user ID of the user who registered the address. The user ID represents a piece of information uniquely identifying the user who uses the image forming apparatus for example a company member number .

That the publication flag is set to 1 means that the address is made public posted on the shared address book and that the publication flag is set to 0 means that the address is not made public not posted on the shared address book and listed only on the personal address book. That the save flag is set to 1 means that the address is moved to the save folder if save conditions are satisfied and that save flag is set to 0 means that the address is not moved to the save folder even if save conditions are satisfied.

In the registration number call number is designated by a three digit number. By pressing the three digit number by using ten keys a destination can be designated. Designation of a destination in this manner is referred to as abbreviated dial. The three digit number can be related to a destination name displayed on display panel . When the destination name is displayed on the touch panel and the destination name is pressed by the user the destination can be designated by the related three digit number. Designation of a destination in this manner is referred to as speed dial. The abbreviated dial and speed dial are not limited to the above. The difference between the abbreviated dial and speed dial is not directly related to the characteristic portion of the present invention and therefore these are described not particularly distinguished from each other unless so specified.

In image forming apparatus in accordance with the present embodiment in order to maintain the address registration table shown in and thereby to display an appropriate address book to the user an address use management table including such fields as shown in is stored in hard disk or in RAM .

Referring to in the address use management table also the registration number Reg. No. for each address is used as a key as in . The address use management table at least includes a field storing normal not moved to save folder or saved moved to save folder indicating the present state of the address a field storing a month season in which the address was used with high frequency before determination that the address is to be saved before save conditions are satisfied and a plurality of fields storing use history date and time of use and user ID in which the address is designated as a destination. A month in which an address was used frequently designated as destination is determined by accumulating the monthly number of designations and the season is determined by accumulating the number of designations in corresponding three months.

That the present state is normal means that the address is displayed in a normal folder of the address book and that the present state is saved means that it is displayed in the save folder of the address book. The seasons are classified to December to February winter March to May spring June to August summer and September to November autumn . The classification is not limited thereto and the year may be classified to January to March April to June July to September and October to December. Further the unit of classification is not limited to three months.

Among the plurality of fields storing the use history date and time of use and user ID the use history n consists of the date and time n and the user ID n n is a natural number . The address use management table stores the use history in time sequential order of use designation as destination . In the following it is assumed that the use history n is newer than use history n 1 . Therefore use history 1 date and time of use 1 user ID 1 represents the use history of the address most recently designated as a destination.

Image forming apparatus in accordance with the present embodiment includes a transmission unit for transmitting image data to an apparatus other than itself an auto save unit for automatically moving an address that satisfied save conditions in the address book to the save folder an auto restore unit for moving restoring the address in the save folder that satisfied restore conditions to the original address book a manual restore unit for restoring an address in the save folder to the original address book by the user operation and a deletion unit for deleting an address in the save folder that satisfies deletion conditions from a storage unit hard disk of image forming apparatus . The transmission unit auto save unit auto restore unit and the deletion unit may be implemented as hardware. In the present embodiment however these are realized by software as will be discussed in the following.

CPU of image forming apparatus executes in parallel with such a program a program for realizing general functions of a computer or an image forming apparatus. The program however is not directly related to the characteristic portion of the present invention and therefore details thereof will not be described here.

When a user is to use image forming apparatus in accordance with the present embodiment the user must log in. When the user touches the operation panel of image forming apparatus a log in image is displayed. When the user inputs a correct combination of a user ID and a password using the image log in of the user is permitted. If a fingerprint authentication device is incorporated in image forming apparatus the user inputs his her fingerprint by placing his her finger on the fingerprint authentication device and if authorized by the fingerprint authentication device log in of the user is permitted. The user ID of logged in user is stored in image forming apparatus . When log in is complete an initial image allowing selection of main operation modes is displayed on display panel of the image forming apparatus.

It is assumed that image forming apparatus has three modes that is copy mode fax image transmission mode and document filing mode. Buttons for selecting these modes are displayed on the initial image. These buttons are software buttons tab buttons displayed at the uppermost portion of display panel . If any of these buttons is pressed it is determined that the user designated a mode and the program corresponding to the selected mode is activated. Image forming apparatus may have the printer mode as an additional operation mode.

In the following a process when a cancel key is pressed and a process when a prescribed time period passed without any operation are not described in detail for simplicity of description.

The program having the control structure shown in is called when fax image transmission mode button is pressed. Referring to at step hereinafter step will be denoted as S CPU displays an initial image designating a destination of fax image transmission. At S CPU reads the address registration table and the address use management table .

At S based on the read table CPU displays a page requested by the user of an address book designated by the user either the shared address book or the personal address book overlapped on the initial image displayed at S. Here together with the addresses of a normal folder in the address book a save folder button is displayed. When the save folder button is pressed an address or addresses of the save folder in the address book is displayed. Whether an address is displayed in the normal folder or save folder is determined based on the state of the address stored in the address use management table . It is possible to designate by a tab whether the shared address book or the personal address book is to be displayed. The process steps of S and may not be carried out separately and these processes may be done simultaneously after the process of S.

At S CPU determines whether or not the destination of fax image transmission has been designated. Here if an address displayed on display panel is pressed and destination OK button is pressed CPU determines that a destination is designated. If it is determined that a destination of fax image transmission is designated YES at S the process proceeds to S. Otherwise NO at S the process returns to S and waits until it is determined that a destination of fax image transmission is designated.

At S CPU writes the date and time of use and the used user ID logged in user ID of the address designated as the destination of fax image transmission in the address use management table.

At S CPU executes the auto restore process subroutine . Details of the auto restore process will be described later. At S CPU executes the transmission process.

Referring to at S CPU reads the address use management table . At S CPU extracts an address or addresses which are not used for more than one month from the latest date and time of use among the addresses having normal stored in the field representing the present state of the address. In the use history n is newer than the use history n 1 and therefore an address which is not used for more than one month from the date and time of use 1 of the latest use history 1 is extracted.

At S CPU determines whether or not there is an extracted address. If it is determined that there is an extracted address YES at S the process proceeds to S. Otherwise NO at S the process ends.

At S CPU determines whether or not the extracted address can be moved to the save folder can be saved or not . Here CPU determines whether or not the movement to save folder is possible based on the state of save flag 1 or 0 of the address registration table . If it is determined that extracted address can be moved to the save folder save flag is set to 1 YES at S the process proceeds to S. Otherwise save flag is set to 0 NO at S the process ends.

At S CPU changes the indication normal of the field representing the present state of the corresponding address to saved in the address use management table . The processes of S and S are executed on all addresses extracted by the process of S.

Referring to the subroutine program of S shown in will be described. At S CPU determines whether or not a destination of fax image transmission is designated from an address that has been moved to the save folder. If it is determined that the destination of fax image transmission is designated from an address that has been moved to the save folder YES at S the process proceeds to S. Otherwise NO at S the process ends.

At S CPU reads auto restore conditions. The auto restore conditions are set by a system administrator and stored in hard disk or RAM . Here as the auto restore conditions one user designated an address moved to save folder 10 times or unspecified users designated an address moved to save folder 5 times are set for the shared address book. For a personal address book one user the owner and user of the address book designated an address moved to save folder 3 times is set. When these conditions are satisfied the corresponding address is returned to the original address book. As the auto restore conditions the number of designations by a specific user may be set. In that case if an address is designated only once by the specific user the address will be returned and therefore it is simply a setting of the user. If only the number of designations is set without regard to whether it is by the same user or a plurality of users it is only a setting of the number.

At S CPU determines whether or not the address designated as the destination of fax image transmission satisfies the auto restore conditions. At this time CPU determines whether or not the auto restore conditions are satisfied based on the history of use after the date and time of movement to the save folder stored in the address use management table . More specifically for the shared address book if the present designation of fax image transmission is the tenth designation by the same user after the date and time of movement to the save folder the auto restore conditions are determined to be satisfied. Alternatively for the shared address book if the present designation of fax image transmission is the fifth designation by different users after the date and time of movement to the save folder the auto restore conditions are determined to be satisfied. For the personal address book if the present designation of fax image transmission is the third designation by the owner user of the personal address book after the date and time of movement to the save folder the auto restore conditions are determined to be satisfied. If it is determined that the auto restore conditions are satisfied YES at S the process proceeds to S. Otherwise NO at S the process ends.

At S CPU displays an auto restore confirmation dialog confirming auto restore of the address from the save folder to the normal folder on display panel .

At S CPU changes the indication saved of the field representing the present state of the corresponding address address as the object of auto restore to normal in the address use management table .

The manual restore program having the control structure shown in is activated when the save folder button displayed on display panel together with the addresses of normal folder of the address book no matter whether it is the shared address book or a personal address book is pressed. Specifically detecting that the save folder button displayed on display panel is pressed CPU determines that a request to display the save folder is detected and it activates the manual restore program.

At S CPU displays an address or addresses that have been moved to the save folder on display panel . Here for a personal address book any address having the publication flag of 0 and the present state of saved in the address use management table of is extracted. Information corresponding to the extracted address of which registered owner ID matches the logged in user ID is read from the address registration table shown in and displayed on display panel . For a shared address book any address having the publication flag of 1 and the present state of saved in the address use management table of is extracted. Information corresponding to the extracted address is read from the address registration table shown in and displayed on display panel .

At S CPU determines whether or not an address to be restored from the save folder to the normal folder has been designated. Here if an address displayed on display panel is pressed and return to normal button is pressed CPU determines that an address to be returned from the save folder to the normal folder is designated. When the address to be returned from the save folder to the normal folder is designated YES at S the process proceeds to S. Otherwise NO at S the process ends. It is NO at S if any address to be returned from the save folder to the normal folder is not designated in a prescribed time period.

At S CPU displays a manual restore confirmation dialog confirming manual restore of an address from the save folder to the normal folder on display panel . Here on display panel a message asking an input as to whether the address 005 for example is to be returned from the save folder to the normal folder is displayed.

At S CPU determines whether or not a request for manually restoring an address in the save folder to the normal folder is detected. Here if the YES button of YES NO button displayed together with the message asking an input as to whether the address 005 is to be returned from the save folder to the normal folder is pressed it determines that the request for manually restoring the address in the save folder to the normal folder is detected. If it is determined that the request for manually restoring the address in the save folder to the normal folder is detected YES at S the process proceeds to S. Otherwise NO at S the process ends.

At S CPU changes the indication saved of the field representing the present state of the corresponding address address as the object of manual restore to normal in the address use management table .

The deletion program having the control structure shown in is periodically activated for example once a month.

Referring to when the deletion program is activated at S CPU reads the address use management table . At S CPU extracts any address which is not used for one year from the latest date and time of use among the addresses having normal stored in the field representing the present state of the corresponding address. In the present embodiment the use history n is newer than use history n 1 . Therefore an address which is not used for one year from date and time of use 1 of use history 1 is extracted.

At S CPU determines whether or not there is any extracted address. If it is determined that there is an extracted address YES at S the process proceeds to S. Otherwise NO at S the process ends.

At S CPU determines whether or not the logged in user is authorized to delete the extracted address. If the logged in user is an administrator the logged in user is authorized to delete every registered address of all address books. A logged in user who is not an administrator is authorized to delete an address registered by himself herself. If it is determined that deletion is authorized YES at S the process proceeds to S. Otherwise NO at S the process ends.

At S CPU displays a deletion confirmation dialog confirming deletion of the address that was not used for the past one year after moved to the save folder on display panel . Here on display panel a message asking an input as to whether the address 099 for example is to be deleted from the image forming apparatus is displayed.

At S CPU determines whether or not a request for deleting the address in the save folder is detected. Here if the YES button of YES NO button displayed together with the message asking an input as to whether the address 099 is to be deleted from the image forming apparatus is pressed it determines that the request for deleting the address in the save folder is detected. If it is determined that the request for deleting the address in the save folder is detected YES at S the process proceeds to S. Otherwise NO at S the process ends.

An operation of image forming apparatus in accordance with the present embodiment based on the configuration and flowcharts above will be described with reference to .

Referring to the setting dialog includes as system setting items save conditions of moving an address not used for a prescribed time period after the latest date and time of use here set to be one month to the save folder deletion conditions of deleting an address not used for a prescribed time period after the latest date and time of use here set to be one year from image forming apparatus and restore conditions of automatically restoring an address designated for a prescribed number of times as a destination of fax image transmission in the save folder to the normal folder of the original address book. Here as restore conditions 1 one user designated an address moved to save folder 10 times or unspecified users designated an address moved to save folder 5 times are set for the shared address book and as restore conditions 2 one user the owner and user of the address book designated an address moved to save folder 3 times is set for the personal address book.

The save conditions deletion conditions and restore conditions set by the administrator using the system setting dialog shown in are stored in hard disk or RAM .

Referring to the address registration dialog can be operated by a logged in user. In the address registration image items corresponding to the fields of address registration table shown in are set. The registration number Reg. No. may be automatically allotted by the system.

For one registration number Reg. No. one address is registered. Items of registration include display name FAX number mail address publication flag and save flag. At least one of FAX number and mail address must be set.

If the user registering the address is willing to publish post the address on the shared address book the user presses publication shared address book button. Then the publication flag is set to 1 . If the user registering the address does not want to have the address published posted on the shared address book the user presses non publication personal address book . Then the publication flag is set to 0 . If the publication flag is set to 1 the address is published posted on the shared address book and if the publication flag is set to 0 the address is not published posted on the shared address book but listed only on the personal address book. Either the publication shared address book button or the non publication personal address book button must be designated.

If the user registering the address thinks that the address may be moved to the save folder if the address satisfies the save conditions he she presses the save button. Then the save flag is set to 1 . If the user registering the address thinks that the address should not be moved to the save folder even if the address satisfies the save conditions he she presses the not save button. Then the save flag is set to 0 . If the save flag is set to 1 the address is moved to the save folder if the save conditions are satisfied and if the save flag is set to 0 the address is not moved to the save folder even if the save conditions are satisfied. Either the save button or the not save button must be designated.

When a user wishes to transmit image data he she logs in to image forming apparatus having the log in image shown in displayed on display panel . Here the user inputs the log in name user ID and the password as the items displayed on the log in image shown in . If these input items are registered in the authentication source image forming apparatus permits log in of the user and the logged in user ID is stored. The user ID is kept displayed on display panel of image forming apparatus while the user is logged in.

Assume that the logged in user transmits image data. The user presses the fax image transmission tab button displayed at the uppermost portion of display panel . Then the program having the control structure shown in is activated.

The address registration table and the address use management table are read S and based on the read tables a page requested by the user of an address book designated by the user either the shared address book or the personal address book is displayed S . By way of example a dialog such as shown in is displayed on display panel .

In the dialog shown in addresses starting with A B or C in the normal folder of the shared address book are shown in ascending order of the registration number. On the lower right portion of the image the save folder button is displayed. In the present embodiment a combination of characters and a trash box icon is displayed on the save folder button. When the save folder button is pressed an address in the save folder of shared address book is displayed as shown in . As can be seen from an address 005 of the shared address book has been moved to the save folder according to the address use management table of it was moved to the save folder on Jul. 31 2009 .

In the dialog shown in on the left side of ABC button a tab button to designate either the shared address book or the personal address book to be displayed is displayed. If the personal address book is designated by this tab button addresses starting with A B or C in the normal folder of personal address book are displayed in the ascending order of registration number together with the save folder button button for moving to the save folder of the personal address book .

Assume that the logged in user designates an address having the registration number 005 stored in the save folder of shared address book shown in as the destination of fax image transmission. Here when the 005 button displayed on display panel is pressed the address 005 is set to the designated state the designated state is represented by a double frame . When the destination OK button is pressed the address 005 is designated as the destination of fax image transmission YES at S . For simplicity of description it is assumed that this designation of address 005 that has been moved to the save folder of shared address book is the fifth designation by different users.

If the logged in user designates an address 002 displayed in the normal folder of shared address book shown in as the destination of fax image transmission the operation is as follows. Specifically the user presses the 002 button displayed on display panel . Then the address 002 is set to the designated state as shown in . When the user further presses the destination OK button the address 002 is designated as the destination of fax image transmission YES at S .

The date and time of use and the used user ID of the address here address 005 designated by the user as the destination of fax image transmission are written to the address use management table S . At this time in the use history of address 005 that the address has been designated by five different users after it was moved to the save folder after the date of movement to the save folder is stored. By way of example date and time and the user stored as the use history include 1 used on Aug. 21 2009 09 45 30 current data and time by a user having user ID 0001 currently logged in user 2 used on Aug. 17 2009 16 02 13 by a user having user ID 0021 3 used on Aug. 16 2009 13 37 27 by a user having user ID 0031 4 used on Aug. 13 2009 09 52 55 by a user having user ID 0041 and 5 used on Aug. 4 2009 11 25 22 by a user having user ID 0051. The date and time of use 6 represents the date and time for example Jun. 30 2009 when the address was designated as the destination of fax image transmission in the normal folder more than one month before Jul. 31 2009 when the address was moved to the save folder since the auto save conditions are set to one month the address was not designated in the normal folder in July .

In such a case the address in the save folder is designated as the destination of fax image transmission YES at S and the auto restore conditions are satisfied YES at S . The auto restore confirmation dialog shown in is displayed on display panel S . As shown in the address 005 is displayed together with a message THE ADDRESS DESIGNATED TO BE A DESTINATION IN SAVED ADDRESS LIST SATISFIES RESTORE CONDITIONS 5 DESIGNATIONS BY DIFFERENT USERS AND RESTORED TO THE ORIGINAL SHARED ADDRESS BOOK and NEXT button is displayed. When the logged in user presses the NEXT button the indication saved of the field representing the present state of the corresponding address 005 is changed to normal in the address use management table step S . Thus the address 005 comes to be displayed in the normal folder of shared address book as shown in which will be described later.

Thereafter the image data transmission process is carried out and desired image data is transmitted to the address 005 S .

If an address in the save folder is designated as a destination of fax image transmission YES at S and different auto restore conditions are satisfied YES at S the auto restore confirmation dialog shown in is displayed on display panel S . As shown in the address 005 is displayed together with a message THE ADDRESS DESIGNATED TO BE A DESTINATION IN SAVED ADDRESS LIST SATISFIES RESTORE CONDITIONS 10 DESIGNATIONS BY THE SAME USER AND RESTORED TO THE ORIGINAL SHARED ADDRESS BOOK and NEXT button is displayed. When the logged in user presses the NEXT button the indication saved of the field representing the present state of the corresponding address 005 is changed to normal in the address use management table step S . Thus the address 005 comes to be displayed in the normal folder of shared address book as shown in which will be described later.

If an address in the save folder of a personal address book is designated as a destination of fax image transmission YES at S and the auto restore conditions set for the personal address book are satisfied YES at S an auto restore confirmation dialog shown in is displayed on display panel S . As shown in the address 055 is displayed together with a message THE ADDRESS DESIGNATED TO BE A DESTINATION IN SAVED ADDRESS LIST SATISFIES RESTORE CONDITIONS 3 DESIGNATIONS BY THE SAME USER AND RESTORED TO THE ORIGINAL PERSONAL ADDRESS BOOK and NEXT button is displayed. When the logged in user presses the NEXT button the indication saved of the field representing the present state of the corresponding address 055 is changed to normal in the address use management table step S . Thus the address 055 comes to be displayed in the normal folder of personal address book.

When 24 hours pass from the last auto save operation the auto save program having the control structure shown in is activated. The address use management table is read S and any address not used for one month or more from the latest date and time of use date and time 1 of use history 1 is extracted from the addresses having normal stored in the field indicating the present state of the address S .

If there is an extracted address YES at S and the save flag of the extracted address is set to 1 it is determined that the address may be moved to the save folder YES at S .

In the address use management table the indication normal of the field representing the present state of the corresponding address is changed to saved S .

Accordingly thereafter the address not used for more than one month from the latest date and time of use not designated as the destination of fax image transmission comes to be displayed in the save folder saved address list .

Assume that addresses starting with A B or C are displayed in the normal folder of the shared address book in ascending order of the registration number as shown in . When the save folder button displayed on the lower right portion of the image is pressed the manual restore program having the control structure shown in is activated and the address in the save folder of shared address book is displayed as shown in S . As shown in the address 005 of the shared address book has been moved to the save folder according to the address use management table of it was moved to the save folder on Jul. 31 2009 and therefore it is displayed in the saved address list.

As shown in if the address 005 button that is to be returned from the save folder to the normal folder is pressed and the return to normal button is pressed as shown in it is determined that the address 005 is designated as an address to be returned from the save folder to the normal folder S .

A message asking an input of whether the address 005 is to be returned from the save folder to the normal folder is displayed S . If the logged in user presses YES of YES NO button in response to the message it is determined that a request for manually restoring the address in the save folder to the normal folder is detected YES at S .

In the address use management table indication saved of the field representing the present state of the corresponding address 005 is changed to normal. Thus the address 005 comes to be displayed in the normal folder of shared address book as shown in . When the normal folder of shared address book shown in is compared with the normal folder of shared address book shown in it can be seen that in the shared address book the address 005 is restored from the save folder to the normal folder.

When one month passes from the last deletion operation the deletion program having the control structure shown in is activated. When the deletion program is executed the address use management table is read S . Any address which is not used for one year from the latest date and time of use date and time of use 1 of use history 1 among the addresses having normal stored in the field representing the present state of the corresponding address is extracted S . Here it is assumed that the address 099 is extracted.

As described above if the logged in user is an administrator the logged in user is authorized to delete every registered address of all address books. A logged in user who is not an administrator is authorized to delete an address registered by himself herself. Here it is assumed that the user for example administrator who logged in is authorized to delete the extracted address.

Since there is an extracted address YES at S and the user authorized to delete the extracted address is logged in it is determined that deletion is authorized YES at S .

In order to confirm deletion of an address that was not used for one year after moved to the save folder a deletion confirmation dialog shown in is displayed on display panel S . As shown in the address to be deleted 099 is displayed together with the message THE ADDRESS BELOW NOT DESIGNATED AS DESTINATION FOR 1 YEAR IN SAVED ADDRESS LIST SATISFIED DELETION CONDITIONS. PRESENT LOGGED IN USER IS AUTHORIZED TO DELETE. DELETE and YES DELETE and NO NOT DELETE buttons are displayed. If the logged in user presses YES DELETE button YES at S the information of address 099 is deleted in the address registration table S . Thus the address 099 is deleted from the storage device hard disk or RAM of image forming apparatus .

As described above in the image forming apparatus in accordance with the present embodiment 1 at the time of image transmission a destination of transmitting image data is designated using an address book registered in advance 2 even an address registered in the address book is automatically moved to the save folder if the frequency of use is low 3 if the address moved to the save folder is designated as a destination or restore thereof is requested by the user it is restored to the original address book and 4 if deletion conditions are satisfied the address that has been moved to the save folder is deleted from the address book. As described above in the image forming apparatus in accordance with the present embodiment the address book is managed such that the image transmission destination can be appropriately designated by the user. As a result by using the address book the transmission destination of the image data can readily be designated by speed dial or abbreviated dial.

In the following an image forming apparatus in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention will be described. In the image forming apparatus in accordance with the present embodiment a save folder display program is used in place of the manual restore program of the first embodiment. The saved folder display program displays when an address or addresses that have been moved to the saved folder are displayed the saved address list on display panel in a manner allowing the user to easily designate a destination address or a manual restore address from the save folder. The structure of image forming apparatus in accordance with the present embodiment is different from the first embodiment only in that the save folder display program which will be described below is used in place of the manual restore program in the program structures executed by CPU .

Similar to the manual restore program of the first embodiment the save folder display program having the control structure shown in is activated when the save folder button displayed on display panel together with addresses on the destination designating dialog of is pressed.

At S CPU extracts any address having saved stored in the field representing the present state of the address in the address use management table.

At S CPU sorts the extracted addresses in the order of latest date and time of use. At this time based on the date and time data stored as the date and time of use 1 of use history 1 of each address CPU sorts the addresses in the order of latest date and time of use. The sorted address are displayed on a save folder display image such as shown in at S.

At S CPU determines whether or not a request for displaying any address not used for N months N is an arbitrary natural number not larger than 12. Here for simplicity of description N is assumed to be a natural number not larger than 5. N may be designated by a user as will be described later on the save folder display is detected. If it is determined that a request for displaying any address not used for N months is detected YES at S the process proceeds to S. In the following a button generating this request will be referred to as N months button and the request will be referred to as N months display request. Otherwise NO at S the control proceeds to S. It is NO at S if the N months display request is not designated on the save folder in a prescribed time period.

At S CPU displays an address or addresses not used for N months. Here based on the addresses sorted in the order of latest date and time of use CPU extracts and displays any address not used for the designated N months. Thereafter the control proceeds to S.

If the determination at S is negative at S all addresses extracted at S are displayed on the save folder display image. Thereafter the control proceeds to S.

At S the control waits for a user input and determines whether or not the N months button is pressed. If the determination is positive the flow returns to S and display is given in accordance with a newly designated N. If the determination is negative the control proceeds to S.

At S whether or not the return to normal button is pressed designating any of the displayed addresses is determined. If the determination is positive the control proceeds to S. Otherwise the control proceeds to S.

At S a process similar to the manual restore program shown in is carried out. Though not shown in S includes S to S of . After S the control returns to S.

At S whether or not the return button is pressed is determined. If the determination is positive execution of the program ends and the control returns to the program from which the present program was called. If the determination is negative the control returns to S.

The saved address display operation of the image forming apparatus of the present embodiment in accordance with the structure and flowchart above will be described.

It is assumed that as shown in addresses starting with A B or C in the normal folder of the shared address book are displayed in ascending order of the registration number. If the save folder button on the lower right portion of the image is pressed addresses having saved stored in the field indicating the present state of the address in the address use management table are extracted S and the extracted addresses are sorted in the order of latest date and time of use S .

On as can be clearly seen from the comparison with tab buttons of 1 month 2 months 3 months 4 months and 5 months indicating the time period in which an address is not designated as a destination of fax image transmission are displayed below the saved address list. Further all tab button is also displayed which corresponds to display of the saved address list of all periods. In the example of the tab button of 1 month is pressed and an address or addresses not designated as a destination of fax image transmission for the past one month in the saved address list are displayed.

If it is detected that the logged in user requests a saved address list not designated as a destination of fax image transmission for the past N months in the save folder YES at S an address or addresses in the save folder of shared address book and not used for N months are displayed as shown in S . If such a request is not detected NO at S the addresses sorted at S are displayed on the save folder display image in the manner as shown in S .

In this manner with the addresses not used for one month among the addressees in the save folder of shared address book displayed on when the address 005 button to be restored from the save folder to the normal folder is pressed and the return to normal button is pressed as shown in NO at S YES at S it is determined that the address 005 is designated as the address to be restored from the save folder to the normal folder. Thereafter process steps similar to the manual restore process of the first embodiment are executed and the designated address is restored from the save folder to the normal folder. Thereafter the control returns to S addresses having saved stored in the present state field are extracted and sorted S and S . If the N months display request is detected YES at S S is executed and if not the addresses sorted at S are displayed as they are S . Here the address restored from the save folder to the normal folder at S is not extracted at S and therefore in the updated display it is not displayed on the save folder display image.

On the other hand if the tab button of 1 month is pressed with the save folder display image of being displayed the determination at S becomes positive and addresses narrowed in accordance with the number of months newly designated at S are displayed again.

As described above in the image forming apparatus in accordance with the present embodiment addresses that have been moved to the save folder are displayed classified in accordance with the period in which the addresses are not designated as destinations of fax image transmission on month by month basis. This makes it easier for the user to find a desired address in the save folder.

The image forming apparatus in accordance with a third embodiment of the present invention will be described. The image forming apparatus in accordance with the present embodiment executes a save folder display program different from that of the second embodiment in place of the manual restore program of the first embodiment. According to the save folder display program when an address or addresses that have been moved to the save folder are displayed the saved address list is displayed on display panel in a manner allowing the logged in user to easily designate a destination address or an address to be manually restored from the save folder. The structure of the image forming apparatus in accordance with the present embodiment is the same as that of the second embodiment except that the structure of save folder display program is different from that of the second embodiment described above.

Referring to the save folder display program subroutine program executed by CPU of the image forming apparatus in accordance with the present embodiment has the following control structure. The processes at S and S are as described above. At S CPU sorts extracted addresses in ascending order or descending order of the number of use the number of designations as the destination of fax image transmission after the addresses were moved to the save folder. Here CPU sorts the addresses in the order of the number of use based on the data stored as the use history of each address.

At S CPU determines whether or not a request for displaying addresses of which number of use is from M 1 to M 2 M 1 and M 2 are natural numbers and M 1 

At S CPU displays addresses of which number of use in the save folder is M 1 to M 2 . Here CPU extracts and displays addresses of which number of designations is M 1 to M 2 based on the addresses sorted in the order of the number of use. The display image is as shown in . After S the control proceeds to S.

If the determination at S is negative at S all addresses are displayed using the save folder display image of . Thereafter the control proceeds to S.

At S the control waits for a user input. If any of the tab buttons designating the number of use shown in is pressed the determination of S becomes positive values corresponding to the tab button are input to M 1 and M 2 and the control returns to S. If all is pressed 1 may be input to M 1 and the maximum number that can be stored may be input to M 2 .

If the determinant at S is negative the control proceeds to S. Steps S S and S shown in are the same as those shown in except that the control returns to S if the determination at S is negative.

The saved address display operation of the image forming apparatus of the present embodiment in accordance with the structure and flowchart above will be described.

It is assumed that as shown in addresses starting with A B or C in the normal folder of the shared address book are displayed in ascending order of the registration number. If the save folder button on the lower right portion of the image is pressed addresses having saved stored in the field indicating the present state of the address in the address use management table are extracted S S and the extracted addresses are sorted in the order of the number of use after the addresses were moved to the save folder S .

If it is detected that the logged in user requests the saved address list of which number of use in the saved folder is from M 1 to M 2 YES at S addresses in the save folder of the shared address book of which number of use is not smaller than M 1 and not larger than M 2 are displayed as shown in S .

In this state the control waits for a user input. If the user presses any of the tab buttons designating the number of use the determination at S becomes positive and the process of S is executed again. Here addresses of which number of use is at least M 1 and at most M 2 newly designated at S are displayed.

If the user designates one of the addresses and presses the return to normal button the processes of S and S are executed and the designated address is returned from the save folder to the normal folder. Thereafter the control returns to S and the addresses having saved stored in the present state field are extracted. This time the address that has been manually restored to the normal folder at S is not extracted. As a result the restored address is not displayed either at S or S.

If the user presses the return button see the control passes through S and S and execution of the program ends.

As described above in the image forming apparatus in accordance with the present embodiment the address that has been moved to the save folder is displayed classified in accordance with the number of designations as the destination of fax image transmission. This makes it easier for the user to find a desired address in the save folder. Particularly an address not yet automatically restored to the normal folder but used frequently as the destination of fax image transmission from the save folder can easily be restored manually.

In the following an image forming apparatus in accordance with a fourth embodiment of the present invention will be described. The image forming apparatus in accordance with the present embodiment is different from the second and third embodiments in that a different program having the control structure shown in is executed in place of the save folder display programs of the second embodiment shown in and the third embodiment shown in . In the present embodiment according to the save folder display program when an address or addresses that have been moved to the save folder is displayed the saved address list is displayed on display panel in a manner allowing the logged in user to easily designate a destination address or an address to be manually restored from the save folder. The save folder display program is different from the programs of the same name in accordance with the second and third programs. The structure of the image forming apparatus in accordance with the present embodiment is different from the second and third embodiments only in the program structure of the save folder display program.

Referring to the processes at S and S are the same as those of the programs in accordance with the second and third programs. At S CPU classifies the extracted addresses in accordance with the season when the frequency of use was high. Here CPU classifies the addresses in accordance with the season when the frequency of use was high based on the data of months season in which each address was used frequently before determination of saving each address was made in the address use management table.

At S CPU determines whether or not a request for displaying any address used frequently in a designated season hereinafter referred to as a seasonal display request in the save folder display is detected. If it is determined that the seasonal display request is detected YES at S the process proceeds to S. Otherwise NO at S the control proceeds to S. The determination at S is made based on the season last designated after power on. If such designation has never been made the determination at S is NO.

At S CPU displays an address or addresses frequently used in the season of which display is requested winter December to February spring March to May summer June to August and autumn September to November among the addresses in the save folder. shows an example of the displayed save folder display image. Thereafter the control proceeds to S.

At S all addresses are displayed on the save folder display image regardless of the season. Thereafter the control proceeds to S.

At S the control waits for a user input. If the input designates a season the control returns to S. At S an address or addresses frequently used in the newly designated season are displayed. If the determination at S is negative the control proceeds to S.

The process steps S and S following S are the same as those of except that the control returns to S if the result of determination at S is negative.

The saved address display operation of the image forming apparatus of the present embodiment in accordance with the structure and flowchart above will be described.

It is assumed that as shown in addresses starting with A B or C in the normal folder of the shared address book are displayed in ascending order of the registration number. If the save folder button on the lower right portion of the image is pressed addresses having saved stored in the field indicating the present state of the address in the address use management table are extracted S and the extracted addresses are sorted season by season in accordance with the frequency of use S .

If it is detected that a saved address list of the season winter spring summer autumn in which the frequency of use was high YES at S in the save folder is requested an address or addresses that was used frequently in the requested season but thereafter moved to and held in the save folder at present among the addresses of the shared address book are displayed S .

On as can be clearly seen from the comparison with tab buttons of winter spring summer and autumn indicating the season in which an address was frequently designated as a destination of fax image transmission in the normal folder are displayed below the saved address list. Further all tab button is also displayed which corresponds to display of the saved address list of all periods. In the example of the tab button winter is pressed and an address frequently designated as a destination of fax image transmission in winter December to February is displayed for actual example of address display see .

If no season is designated all addresses are displayed on the save folder display image regardless of the season S .

If the user presses any of the buttons designating a season on the save folder display image an address or addresses frequently used in the newly designated season are displayed at S.

If any of the addresses displayed on the save folder display image is designated and the return to normal button is pressed the address is moved from the save folder to the normal folder as in the manual restore operation of the first embodiment. Thereafter at S the address is not extracted and therefore the address is not displayed in the process of S and S.

If return button is pressed in the save folder display image execution of this program ends and the control returns to the program from which the present program was called.

As described above in the image forming apparatus in accordance with the present embodiment addresses moved to the save folder are displayed classified season by season in accordance with the frequency of designation as the destination of fax image transmission. This makes it easier for the user to find a desired address in the save folder. Particularly an address not yet automatically restored to the normal folder but used frequently at certain season from the save folder can easily be restored manually. Further it becomes easier to designate a destination to which image data is repeatedly transmitted at certain season from the save folder.

The fourth embodiment may be combined with the third embodiment. In that case if the tab button winter shown in is pressed the display may be switched to the image shown in . In the example shown in from the displayed addresses the address or addresses can be further narrowed down based on the number of use. By way of example addresses used frequently in winter may be displayed in accordance with the number of use in the save folder as shown in . In this example the displayed season is indicated on the right side of return to normal button. In this case when the return key is pressed the display may be returned to the image of .
