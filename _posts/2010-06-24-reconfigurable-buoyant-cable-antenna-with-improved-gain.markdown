title: Reconfigurable buoyant cable antenna with improved gain
abstract: An antenna element with a single-conductor antenna is provided within a removable core. The removable core is mounted within a hollow liner by sliding the core into the hollow liner. A pull cable may be attached to an end of the removable core to pull the core through the outboard end of the hollow liner. Due to reduced strain on the core as compared to the liner, the single-conductor antenna may be formed in segments interconnected with capacitors for adjusting the antenna gain to a maximum in the vicinity of a desired operating frequency or frequencies.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.

The present invention relates generally to a buoyant cable antenna BCA suitable for submarine communications and more particularly to a reconfigurable buoyant cable antenna element for the BCA system.

The buoyant cable antenna is one of a host of antennas currently in use by submarines. It is used for wireless electronic communications while the submarine is submerged.

The prior art antenna element for a buoyant cable antenna comprises a core that consists of a cylindrical insulated single wire with a cylindrical layer of insulation. A buoyancy layer jacket is either injection molded or extruded in place onto the core to make the final structure a solid object. This arrangement makes it impossible to remove the core if the core becomes damaged or if a new kind of core is needed to meet a specific mission. This arrangement also makes it impossible to reconfigure the antenna for other applications or specific applications.

Current designs for buoyant cable antennas suffer from limited gain and bandwidth performance due to the resonant behavior of the antenna element. For example it is not possible to insert circuit elements into the single wire antenna to change its behavior due to the stress that is applied to the core during towing.

The following U.S. patents describe various prior art systems that may be related to the above and or other buoyant cable antenna systems 

U.S. Pat. No. 5 745 436 issued Apr. 28 1998 to Bittleston discloses a semi dry marine seismic streamer cable that consists of a number of connected streamer cable sections which each comprise a mechanical jacket surrounding a hollow core enclosing seismic sensor and signal transfer means. Elongated axial stress elements for transmitting axial loads and a radial reinforcement member for relieving radial loads are provided in the jacket. The core is filled with a fluid or a fluid saturated foam and the sensor means are mounted in the core by vibration isolating elements.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 426 464 issued Jul. 30 2002 to Spellman et al discloses a cable sectional assembly that houses an electrically concatenated series of electronic circuit modules and has electric hook up media interspersed between the modules. Each run of interspersed hook up media is surrounded by a flexible tubular member which is oversized to allow movement of the hook up media without restriction under flexing of the assembly. The assembly is a construction and arrangement of two forms of moldingly bonded encapsulations. The first of these forms is made of a hard encapsulant and forms a unitary encapsulation local to each electronic module which i encapsulates the circuit module and associated electrical coupling connections between the adjacent end of each individual run of an adjacent interspersed run of media and an electrical terminal of the module and ii is securely bonded to the adjacent marginal end portions of the tubular members which surround the adjacent interspersed runs of hook up media. The second form is an overmolded annular encapsulation made of a softer flexible encapsulant which fills the annular spaces between the encapsulations of the first form and which is securely moldingly bonded to the midportion of the tubular member and the adjacent lateral surfaces of the encapsulations of the first form. Both the first and second forms of encapsulations are made of cool curing types of encapsulants.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 473 365 issued Oct. 29 2002 to Joh et al discloses a support structure of hydrophones for a towed array sonar system which includes elastic members arranged in each sensor package and adapted to support a hydrophone received in the sensor package while attenuating vibrations transmitted to the sensor package. External vibrations such as vibrations generated due to the running of a towing vessel or vibrations induced due to motions of a towing cable which are irrespective of acoustic waves reflected by a target moving underwater are attenuated by the hydrophone support structure during the transmission thereof from the sensor package to the hydrophones so that the hydrophones are suppressed from vibrating due to the external vibrations.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 982 383 issued Jan. 3 2006 to Spellman et al discloses a cable section assembly for marine applications having a core structure such as a buoyant cable antenna interim manufacturing step subassembly and a protective casing formed from heat shrinkable tubing which together with the interim subassembly forms a complete assembly. For buoyant cable assembly applications the interim subassembly is at least partially formed of polyurethane material having glass microballoons distributed therein with such material in any event occupying an outer layer portion of the subassembly. The cable section assembly of the present invention is formed by providing a length of heat shrinkable flexible tubing inflating or expanding the heat shrinkable tubing to its approximate full diameter inserting the core structure into the length of tubing and shrinking the tubing around the core structure.

U.S. Pat. No. 7 429 957 issued Sep. 30 2008 to Tonn discloses a buoyant cable antenna element that employs a specific double negative meta material sheath with a negative permeability. The double negative meta material sheath is disposed over the insulated wire portion of the buoyant cable antenna element. The double negative meta material sheath enables a deliberate reduction in the antenna wire inductance to a zero value at a desired critical frequency. Reducing the antenna wire inductance to zero creates a traveling wave structure antenna having enhanced bandwidth.

Accordingly the present invention provides an antenna element in a buoyant cable antenna which is towed by a submarine. The antenna element may comprise one or more elements such as for example only a removable core that may comprise a straight cylindrical single conductor wire which acts as an antenna.

In another embodiment the straight cylindrical single conductor wire comprises a plurality of segments and may further comprise a plurality of capacitors which interconnect the plurality of segments. The capacitors may be used to adjust the performance of the antenna or to optimize it near a desired frequency.

In another embodiment the straight cylindrical single conductor wire may or may not comprise a plurality of segments. If desired any segments may be interconnected utilizing microelements such as capacitors filters amplifiers sensors and the like.

In another embodiment the invention comprises a method for making an antenna element for use in a buoyant cable antenna for towing by a submarine. The method may comprise one or more steps such as for example providing a removable core which comprises a straight cylindrical single conductor wire to act as an antenna and providing a liner to surround the removable core.

Other steps may comprise providing that the liner define a hollow interior with an inner diameter. The removable core may comprise an outer diameter sufficiently smaller than the inner diameter of the hollow interior such that the removable core is slidable with respect to the liner during mounting of the core within the liner. The method may further comprise providing that the liner comprises a buoyancy jacket which is operable to provide that the antenna element is buoyant in water.

In one possible embodiment the method may comprise the steps of attaching a pull cable to an outboard end of the removable core and providing that the pull cable is sufficiently strong enough and long enough to pull the removable core into the liner from an outboard end of the liner.

The method may further comprise securing a watertight cap to the outboard end of the liner such that the pull cable is stored within the hollow interior of the liner inside of the watertight cap.

The method may further comprise providing that the hollow interior be filled with air that surrounds the removable core.

The method may further comprise providing that the straight cylindrical single conductor wire comprises a plurality of segments and may further comprise interconnecting the plurality of segments using a plurality of capacitors. The method may further comprise utilizing the capacitors for adjusting the performance of the antenna or for optimizing it near a desired frequency. In more detail the method may further comprise utilizing a length of the segments and a size of the capacitors for adjusting the peak gain to occur near a desired frequency.

In another embodiment the method may further comprise providing that the straight cylindrical single conductor wire comprises a plurality of segments and may further comprise interconnecting the plurality of segments using a plurality of microelements.

The method may further comprise providing that said removable core has a length in a range of from forty feet to sixty feet.

In one preferred embodiment the removable core is mounted to have sufficiently less strain applied thereto during towing than the liner whereby segments of the straight cylindrical single conductor wire can be connected utilizing relatively fragile elements such as microelements as discussed hereinafter.

The present invention provides a reconfigurable buoyant cable antenna BCA . In one embodiment the BCA has improved gain performance. The antenna element core can also be removed and replaced based on mission needs. Accordingly the present invention provides an important improvement in BCA technology.

Referring now to the drawings and more particularly to and there is shown a schematic view of antenna element for a buoyant cable antenna. and show core of antenna element . Core comprises straight cylindrical wire which may be a desired size wire e.g. 18 AWG. Best shown in foam insulating layer which may comprise a desired thickness e.g. 0.177 OD is provided around straight cylindrical wire .

In one embodiment at desired intervals which may be regular intervals along the length of core wire is interrupted into segments which are connected by electronic elements which may be microelements such as series capacitors . Capacitors may be ceramic capacitors. The product of this capacitance and the spacing is known as the load factor for the antenna and plays an important role in determining where in the HF band the antenna has its best performance.

In one possible embodiment the length of core may be in the range of about 40 60 feet. In one possible embodiment string or pull cable which may be comprised of Kevlar may be attached to core at the outboard end e.g. the outermost end thereof. In this embodiment string or pull cable may then be utilized to pull core into liner . Liner may be polyethylene. There exists sufficient clearance between core and liner to allow core to easily slide in and out of liner with a minimum of friction. This arrangement not only provides a way to remove core but also provides a means by which core is strain relieved and does not see any of the tensile force that liner sees during towing as shown in thereby protecting core from damage e.g. pulling capacitors apart.

A portion of string used to pull the core into liner may be left inside the outermost end of liner before installing watertight cap . This is done to allow core to be pulled back into liner should it be necessary to remove core . The other end of liner may be fitted with a watertight BCA connector and then attached to a standard BCA coaxial feed .

To remove core cap on the outboard or outermost end is removed so that string can be grasped and prevented from being pulled into liner during the next step. Then inboard connector is removed and core is pulled out of liner . This pulls some of string back into the liner but the free end is not pulled into the liner. The old core may then be cut from the string and the new core attached. String may then be used to pull the new core into liner .

During one test a 51 foot long core was pulled into a liner by means of Kevlar string or pull cable . String or pull cable was originally pulled into liner by means of a vacuum cleaner. However other means e.g. a long straight wire could also be utilized to insert string into liner .

In a preferred embodiment liner comprises buoyancy jacket extruded on an outer surface of liner to give the antenna better speed depth performance when being towed from a submerged submarine.

Accordingly the present invention provides a means for re use of antenna element by allowing core to be removed and replaced with a different core that is customized for a particular application. The preferred embodiment uses a core designed for substantially improved gain performance. In addition the fact that the core now floats mechanically inside liner provides a means for strain relief of the core and components thereof. In the prior art BCA the core is integrated into the jacket and so must be able to bear the mechanical strain seen while being towed precluding the use of miniaturized electrical elements in the core assembly.

As discussed above the preferred embodiment of antenna element comprises a buoyancy jacket over liner wherein liner defines a hollow center that houses core . In another embodiment the jacket could be made of several layers including an inner mechanical strain bearing layer followed by the buoyancy layer and finally a surface finish layer. Various types of cores could also be used. In the above described invention core may consist of a periodic structure comprising insulated wire segments and capacitors. This core may be replaced with a single uninterrupted conductor or one with integrated electronics e.g. amplifiers filters sensors and the like.

Many additional changes in the details components steps and organization of the system herein described and illustrated to explain the nature of the invention may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention. It is therefore understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.
