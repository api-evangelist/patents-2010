title: Generating encoded identifications of selected subsets of installed software packages on a client machine
abstract: Embodiments relate to systems and methods for generating encoded identifications of selected subsets of installed software packages on a client machine. A physical or virtual client machine can host a set of installed software packages, including operating system, application, and/or other software. A package manager tracks the set of installed packages and updates available for the installed set. The package manager can be configured to capture an inventory of the installed packages, and generate an encoded identification of one or more selected subsets of the set of hosted or installed packages based on size, timestamp, and/or other attributes of the subsets and/or constituent files. An administrator or other user can for instance select only that subset or subsets related to a certain project, application, user group, or other selection criteria, and generate encoded identifications of those subsets for package updating, network management, and/or other purposes.

The present teachings relate to systems and methods for generating encoded identifications of selected subsets of installed software packages on a client machine and more particularly to platforms and techniques for generating an encoded identification of selectable subsets of software packages installed on one or more physical or virtual machines in a managed network and or the attributes of those package subsets.

Users of physical or virtual machines commonly install software packages including package updates to physical or virtual machines. The software packages can contain a set of related files chosen to perform a given application or task such as for example a group of software applications drivers and or other resources used to install and use messaging applications. In instances a software package can contain application software operating system software drivers patches and or other software components grouped as a logical set.

Software package update managers exist to help a user initiate and perform software package updates such as for example the yum Yellowdog update manager package update manager available from Red Hat Inc. and others. In general available software package managers are configured to interact with the set of installed packages on a client and with one or more software package repositories to directly connect to those databases and download available package updates.

The task of managing a network of physical and or virtual machines can be complicated by the need to identify and track the population of those machines under management and the software package complements installed on those machines. The machines under management and this package complements may need to be identified and tracked for a variety of purposes including for instance to identify and schedule package updates activate and deactivate machines assigned to cloud or other networks perform maintenance and or other package or network management tasks. In various networks for example including those having multiple network administrators the task of maintaining an inventory of machines software packages on those machines and or other resources may be difficult to coordinate. In cases network administrators or other users may wish to discover or inventory machines hosting specified individual packages and or groups of packages that may be installed on network machines without necessarily retrieving a full profile of all software packages on a given machine. For example an administrator may wish to identify and update all machines in a managed network having an installed package or set of packages containing software for a certain engineering or software development product or project without having to identify or analyze all machines present on the network. It may be desirable to provide systems and methods for generating encoded identifications of selected subsets of installed software packages on a client machine in which machines under management and their hosted packages selected subsets of those packages and or other resources can be discovered identified stored updated and tracked using captured package profiles facilitating maintenance updating and other operations on those deployments including selectable subsets or groups of package installations.

Embodiments of the present teachings relate to for generating encoded identifications of selected subsets of installed software packages on a client machine. More particularly embodiments related to platforms and techniques for extracting a profile of installed packages selectable subsets of those packages and or other resources hosted on a set of known or unknown machines and developing and storing an encoded identification of those machines for network management and or package management purposes. In aspects a package manager can track and manage the installation of one or more software packages and or updates to those packages which may be referred to together as a software package update on a client host target physical virtual and or other machine. The package manager can be configured to access the set of installed packages and or selectable subsets of those packages and their related attributes on the client or other machine and derive or generate an encoded identification based on that characterizing data. In aspects the encoded identification can be or include the results of a hash function applied to package names versions timestamps or dates size number and or other attributes or metadata. In aspects the encoded identification can be or include similar representations or encodings based on one or more selected subsets of the packages installed on a client or other machine based on user selection automatic selections and or other selection criteria. In yet further aspects the encoded identification can be or include the same types of representations or encodings based on the attributes of files contained within packages or selected subsets of those files.

According to aspects in further regards the package manager and or other logic can transmit or share the encoded identification to one or more than one remote management platforms to permit management operations on that set of machines. For instance the encoded identification of one or more machines can be transmitted to or accessed by a remote package server and or software package repository to permit software package updates to be performed on those machines. In aspects the encoded identification can in addition or instead be transmitted to or accessed by a network management platform to identify the subject machine s for network maintenance security and or other management operations. In aspects newly connected machines in a managed network can be automatically discovered or identified and be assigned an encoded representation based on their package profile and or selected package subsets which can be reported to a network management or other platform to be registered and tracked based on that identification or signature. These and other embodiments described herein address the various noted shortcomings in known package management and network management technology and provide a user with enhanced package and system management capability including automatic and or selective identification of deployed machines and their package assets including an ability to characterize and identify machines based on selectable package groupings.

Reference will now be made in detail to exemplary embodiments of the present teachings which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Where possible the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.

In aspects set of installed software packages can be or include packages comprising various types of applications such as for example messaging applications spreadsheet or modeling applications social networking applications word processing applications and or other applications software or utilities and can in aspects include an operating system drivers and or components thereof. Set of installed packages can have an associated set of package attributes which records file names versions dates software requirements an or other attributes or metadata related to the software package updates installed on client . In aspects package manager and or other logic can generate host and or interact with a selector to identify and select one or more selected package subset of set of installed packages . In aspects a user may browse set of installed packages in list or other form via selector to check or otherwise select one or more packages to form one or more selected package subset they wish to analyze manage and or identify on client . In aspects one or more selected package subset can in addition or instead be selected or flagged by an automatic identification process such as for example package manager automatically selecting those packages which have been updated in the last 30 days or using other criteria.

In aspects and as also shown package manager can communicate with a network interface configured to connect to one or more network such as the public Internet or other public or private networks. Package manager can thereby connect to one or more package server and or associated package repository hosting software packages including software package updates and or other software or resources. Package server can include logic to identify organize and distribute one or more software packages to requesting client server virtual and or other machines.

In aspects package manager can interact with set of installed packages package server and or one or more package repository via network interface and one or more networks to identify and manage the content of set of installed packages operating on client and generate an encoded identification of the client and or other resources associated with client . In aspects package manager can for example provide a user with a set of package update options displayed via user interface such as a graphical user interface or others to select various test configuration and or other management activities on set of installed packages . Set of package update options can include options such as one or more selections to perform to select packages for installation and or update installation options and or other options or parameters for the downloading of package updates from one or more package repositories to set of installed packages .

In aspects package manager can access and extract information related to set of installed packages to generate an encoded identification of client set of installed packages one or more selected package subset and or other resources or entities. In aspects package manager may generate encoded identification based on set of installed packages to create an identifier which can be used by local or remote platforms to perform package update network management and or other operations on client . In aspects the encoded identification can represent a string label value address and or other identifier which identifies or associates client by or with its hosted set of installed packages and or one or more selected package subset . For instance encoded identification can represent the output of a hash function or hash operation performed on one or more attributes of a package contained in set of package attributes . For instance package manager can perform a hash function such as Secure Hash Algorithm 1 SHA1 or other hash function versions and or other encoding algorithms on attributes such as the package name package epoch package timestamp package size and or other data. In aspects in certain regards the encoded identification can thereby represent a signature or characterizing code associated with a client and its particular software package complement or selected subset of that complement. In aspects encoded identification can represent a unique identifier for the particular client whose set of installed packages and or one or more package subset has been profiled in managed network . In aspects encoded identification including in cases where a hash function or operator is employed can represent a non unique identifier in managed network for instance due to hash collision or can in aspects represent a unique representation of a client and or its set of installed packages and or one or more package subset .

As illustrated for example more particularly in package manager can connect to one or more remote platforms and communicate encoded identification to those platform s to perform remote package network management and or other operations or services on client . For instance package manager and or other logic can access package server and or one or more repository to initiate package update operations on client . For instance encoded representation can be decoded by package server using package repository via one or more network . Package manager can receive one or more software package update via package server and or one or more repository .

According to aspects package manager and or other logic can interact with other types of remote platforms using encoded representation such as as illustrated a network management platform . Network management platform can be or include any type of known or available management server service and or other platform including for instance the Fedora unified network controller func platform available from Red Hat Inc. Raleigh N.C. and described in co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 130 424 filed May 30 2008 entitled Systems and Methods for Remote Management of Networked Systems Using Secure Modular Platform assigned or under obligation of assignment to the same entity as this application and which application is incorporated herein by reference. Other types or versions of network management platform cane be used. According to aspects network management platform can receive and store encoded identification of one or more than one client registered to or associated with managed network and identify and communicate with corresponding client using that identifier. In aspects for instance an operator of network management platform can interrogate managed network to discover or locate machines of interest using encoded identification based on respective set of installed packages and or set of package attributes . For instance an operator of network management platform and or package server and or other platform or logic can interrogate managed network to transmit a command to identify any client eligible for or compatible with revision 4 of software package XYZ. Any client matching the request can be identified using encoded identifier and or other data associated with corresponding clients or other machines. A query can likewise for instance be transmitted from network management platform to managed network to discover or locate any client hosting software package A and or possessing other attributes resources keys or data using encoded identifier . In aspects network management platform can group or associate one or more clients having common package signatures in their respective encoded identifier and or based on other data or attributes.

In aspects it may be noted that package manager and or other logic on a given client can generate an updated encoded identifier based on triggering events and or other criteria. For instance package manager and or other logic can generate an updated revised or new encoded identifier when set of installed packages in client changes such as when a package update and or other software revision is received and or other resources associated with client are changed. In aspects package manager and or other logic can generate an updated encoded identifier based on other criteria such as at predetermined intervals or other schedules. Other criteria or conditions can be used to initiate an update to encoded identifier of one or more client in managed network . After generating any update to encoded identifier package manager and or other logic can transmit encoded identifier to one or more remote platform such as for instance package server one or more repository network management platform and or other platforms servers machines sites and or services.

In package manager and or other logic can transmit encoded identification to a remote platform such as a package server a network management platform and or other remote server platform or service. In package operations and or other remote network management operations or functions can be initiated on client using encoded identification . For instance in aspects package server can identify client using encoded identification and generate a package update to update set of installed packages on client . For further instance in aspects a network management platform can establish a secure channel or otherwise communicate with client to perform network management functions such as for example performing configuration management on one or more client executing security services related to one or more client and or other management operations. In a managed network containing one or more client can be interrogated for instance via network management platform to discover any newly connected activated and or updated machines. For instance network management platform can be configured to discover physical and or virtual machines having a new network address or other network registration. In package manager can generated an encoded identification of any newly registered and or updated machines for instance by receiving a configuration command from network management platform or otherwise. In processing can return to a prior processing point jump to a further processing point or end.

In package manager and or other logic can generate an encoded identification based on set of attributes for one or more package subset and or constituent files of those packages. In aspects encoded identification representing that package subset or subsets can be generated using a hash function operating on text strings or other data reflecting one or more attributes in set of attributes for subject packages. In cases where a hash function or hash operator is used the hash function can be or include SHA1 Secure Hash Algorithm 1 SHA2 Secure Hash Algorithm 2 SHA3 Secure Hash Algorithm 3 and or other hash functions operators or routines. In aspects encoded identification representing one or more package subset need not be based on a hash function but can in addition or instead be based on other classes of functions or algorithms.

In package manager and or other logic can transmit encoded identification representing one or more package subset to a remote platform such as a package server a network management platform and or other remote server platform or service. In package operations and or other remote network management operations or functions can be initiated on client using encoded identification of one or more package subset . For instance in aspects package server can identify client using encoded identification and generate a package update to update one or more package subset and or the entire set of installed packages on client . For further instance in aspects a network management platform can establish a secure channel or otherwise communicate with client to perform network management functions such as for example performing configuration management on one or more client executing security services related to one or more client and or other management operations. In a managed network containing one or more client can be interrogated for instance via network management platform to discover any newly connected activated and or updated machines. For instance network management platform can be configured to discover physical and or virtual machines having a new network address or other network registration. In package manager can generate an encoded identification of one or more package subset of any newly registered and or updated machines for instance by receiving a configuration command from network management platform or otherwise. In processing can return to a prior processing point jump to a further processing point or end.

It may be noted that in embodiments package manager and or other logic can be configured to generate an encoded identification for selected machines in managed network based on their complete package complement hosted in set of installed packages while generating an encoded identification for other or additional machines based on one or more package subset . It may likewise be noted that in aspects any one client or other machine in managed network or otherwise can be subjected to package analysis and encoding more than one time and or on more than one basis so that for instance a given client can have more than one associated encoded identification for instance an encoded identification representing a complete set of installed packages as well as an encoded identification for one or more package subset present on that machine. Other encoding inputs configurations and outputs are possible.

The foregoing description is illustrative and variations in configuration and implementation may occur to persons skilled in the art. For example while embodiments have been described in which a unitary package manager operating on client is configured to control package management and client identification activity in embodiments multiple local and or remote applications or software can interact to control the downloading installation testing and other management of software packages and the generation of encoded identification . For further example while embodiments have been described in which one encoded identification can be generated for one client in embodiments more than one encoded identification can be generated for a given client for instance by appending additional data to encoded identification and or operating on data stored on or associated with client in addition to set of installed packages and associated set of package attributes . For yet further example while embodiments have been described in which package update or client identification activity is conducted on one client in embodiments multiple local or remote targets clients and or other machines can register to package manager and or other logic or resources to receive or perform package update and or identification encoding activity. Other resources described as singular or integrated can in embodiments be plural or distributed and resources described as multiple or distributed can in embodiments be combined. The scope of the present teachings is accordingly intended to be limited only by the following claims.
