title: Method and structure to develop a test program for semiconductor integrated circuits
abstract: Test program development for a semiconductor test system, such as automated test equipment (ATE), using object-oriented constructs is described. The invention provides a method for describing test system resources, test system configuration, module configuration, test sequence, test plan, test condition, test pattern, and timing information in general-purpose object-oriented constructs, e.g., C++ objects and classes. In particular, the modularity of program development is suitable for developing test programs for an open architecture semiconductor test system.
