The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for Governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The invention relates in general to adhesives and in particular to adhesives for bonding explosive mixtures to metal surfaces.

In some apparatus there may be a need for a bond between an explosive mixture and a metal surface. For example a shaped charge may include explosive material disposed between an outer case and a metal liner. The FIGURE shows a conventional shaped charge with an outer case a metal liner and explosive material disposed between the outer case and the metal liner . A shaped charge may not perform properly if there are gaps between the explosive material and the metal liner .

A method of adhering explosive material directly to the metal surface of a shaped charge liner has not been known. In the past the metal surface of the liner was cleaned with a solvent prior to casting the explosive material into the outer case. Also a release agent was applied to the inner surface of the outer case. These measures were expected to cause the explosive material to release from the case during curing and adhere to the metal liner. However gaps may still occur between the explosive material and the metal liner. Thus a need exists for a method of adhering explosive material directly to a metal surface.

Accordingly it is an object of the present invention to provide an adhesive for bonding a plastic bonded explosive to a metal surface.

Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for adhering an explosive material to a metal surface.

In accordance with the present invention an adhesive is provided for bonding a plastic bonded explosive to a metal surface. The adhesive consists essentially of a mixture of hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene HTPB and isophorone di isocyanate IPDI in a weight ratio in a range of about 5 to 1 to about 10 to 1 and a solvent. The present invention also provides for a method of adhering a plastic bonded explosive to a metal surface including providing the above describe adhesive and applying the adhesive to a metal surface

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the exemplary embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

An adhesive for bonding a plastic bonded explosive to a metal surface may include a mixture of hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene HTPB and isophorone di isocyanate IPDI in a weight ratio in the range of about 5 to 1 to about 10 to 1. In one embodiment the weight ratio of HTPB to IPDI is about 7 to 1. Weight ratios of HTPB to IPDI in the range of about 5 to 1 to about 10 to 1 create NCO OH ratios in the range of about 2.0 to about 1.0. The weight ratio of HTPB to IPDI of about 7 to 1 creates an NCO OH ratio of approximately 1.5.

The adhesive may also include a solvent such as acetone or toluene for example. The solvent may be for example about 30 to about 50 by weight of the adhesive.

The HTPB IPDI mixture may be for example about 50 to about 70 by weight of the adhesive. A catalyst for example dibutyltin dilaurate DBTDL may be added to the adhesive to accelerate the curing time.

The adhesive may be thoroughly mixed in a temperature range of about 150 F. to about 200 F. In one embodiment the adhesive is mixed at about 175 F. The adhesive may be applied to metal surfaces by dipping. The adhesive may be allowed to partially cure at about 125 150 F. for about 72 96 hours. Explosive material may be cast on top of the partially cured adhesive.

The adhesive may include excess isocyanate functionality and the explosive material may include excess hydroxyl functionality which may create a reactive interface between the two polymeric phases. During curing of the explosive material the adhesive may react with components of the explosive material binder system and may create a strong chemical bond. In addition the adhesive may bond well to metal surfaces.

The amount of solvent in the adhesive may be varied. For adhering plastic bonded explosive material to a metal liner in a shaped charge a thin layer of the adhesive may be applied to the metal liner surface. A thin layer of adhesive may be desirable on a shaped charge liner so that the adhesive does not affect the performance of the shaped charge. An exemplary layer of adhesive may have a thickness for example in a range of about 0.0001 inches to about 0.01 inches. In one embodiment the thickness of the adhesive is about 0.001 inches.

In some exemplary embodiments additives that may thicken the adhesive may not be used. In other exemplary embodiments additives that may affect the interaction of the detonation wave with the metal liner may not be used. In conventional technology coatings for rockets may include additives for example carbon that may strengthen the rocket coating. In an exemplary embodiment of the inventive adhesive additives that may strengthen the adhesive may not be used.

A mixture containing 87.72 HTPB and 12.28 IPDI was used in lap shear testing. The mixture was applied between two pairs of metal strips. Each pair of metal strips were squeezed together with clamps and cured for 96 hours at 175 F. The lap shear test demonstrated a bond strength of the mixture between 300 and 500 psi. This strength is well in excess of the material strength of an explosive such as PBXN 110.

Lap shear tests were performed using PBXN 110 sandwiched between a pair of metal strips that were uncoated in one case or coated with the mixture containing 87.72 HTPB and 12.28 IPDI in another case. The five coated samples all failed within the explosive material i.e. within the PBXN 110. The five uncoated samples all failed at the interface between the explosive material and the metal strips.

A mixture containing 87.72 HTPB and 12.28 IPDI was brought to 175 F. and a metal shaped charge liner was dipped in the mixture. The shaped charge liner remained in the mixture for 15 seconds. The liner was removed and allowed to drip with the apex side down for 15 seconds. The liner was placed base side down on a TEFLON coated baking sheet and cured in an oven at 125 F. for 72 96 hours. Sixteen measurements were made on the liner to determine coating thickness and uniformity. The thickness varied between 0.0003 inches and 0.00105 inches. These results were better than anticipated.

Two uncoated metal shaped charge liners were cast with PBXN 110 explosive. Two identical shaped charge liners were coated with a mixture containing 87.72 HTPB and 12.28 IPDI and after partial cure were cast with PBXN 110 explosive. The performance of the four liners was evaluated using flash x ray testing. The two coated liners formed straight coherent jets. The two uncoated liners formed jets that were not straight. The coating had no detrimental effect on the performance of the two coated liners. Also because the uncoated liners did not perform as well as the coated liners the coating may have had a beneficial effect on the liner performance.

Any numerical parameters set forth in the specification and attached claims are approximations for example by using the term about that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present invention. At the very least and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding.
