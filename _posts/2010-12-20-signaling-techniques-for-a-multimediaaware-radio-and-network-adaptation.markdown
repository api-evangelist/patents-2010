title: Signaling techniques for a multimedia-aware radio and network adaptation
abstract: An approach to enhance quality of experience (QoE) in a wireless multimedia communication system is disclosed. A signaling mechanism is provided to make application-layer parameters of a multimedia application to be accessible in one or more network interfaces including an air interface, an access network interface, and a core network interface. Also, the application-layer parameters may be included in quality of service (QoS) class definitions to make the application-layer parameters accessible at the one or more network interfaces. The signaling mechanism and inclusion of application-layer parameters into the QoS class definitions is to enable the QoE-aware link adaptation, resource allocation, joint source channel coding based cross-layer optimizations.

Wireless communication technology has evolved to deliver rich multimedia and video services in addition to the traditional voice and data services. Typical wireless multimedia communications involve the transmission of a continuous source over a noisy channel. Common examples are speech communications mobile TV mobile video and broadcast streaming. In such communications the multimedia source is encoded and compressed into a finite stream of bits and the bit stream is then communicated over the noisy channel. Source coding is carried out to convert the continuous source into a finite stream of bits and channel coding is performed to mitigate the errors in the bit stream introduced by the noisy channel. Often it may be necessary to transmit the source over time varying wireless channels while satisfying certain end to end user quality of experience QoE constraints including average distortion and multimedia quality requirements such as in real time mobile video streaming. Hence towards the design of enhanced wireless multimedia communication technologies it may be preferable to optimize the overall user QoE instead of optimizing more traditional quality of service QoS metrics. In general QoE degradation may be caused by high distortion levels limited bandwidth excessive delay power constraints and computational complexity limitation. In such a scenario separating the compression and channel coding may not be optimal any longer from a user QoE perspective.

To ensure optimality in terms of end to end QoE joint source channel coding JSCC techniques may be used to perform source compression and channel coding in a coordinated fashion. In this context JSCC techniques may jointly optimize codec and radio parameters to minimize end to end distortion. JSCC techniques may support cross layer capabilities which may provide support for PHY MAC NET aware bit rate adaptation at the codec level to enable source channel rate matching e.g. as in adaptive streaming technology widely adopted today in many commercial multimedia delivery systems. Such a cross layer capability can benefit from signaling techniques that feedback QoE parameters from the client to the server such as real time control protocol RTCP standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force IETF in RFC 3551 specification and also used in both packet switched streaming PSS and multimedia broadcast and multicast services MBMS Third Generation Partnership Project 3GPP specifications TS 26.234 and TS 26.346 respectively . Such QoE feedback signaling mechanisms may allow streaming service to adapt the bit rate based on varying network conditions e.g. changing resource availability time varying nature of the wireless channel to ensure higher QoE while maintaining interrupt free playback. However the current wireless communication systems such as those specified in Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access WiMAX and or Long Term Evolution LTE standards do not support cross layer functionalities required to provide application oriented QoE values for multimedia delivery and enable application aware PHY MAC NET layer adaptation including application aware radio resource management and application aware routing and network control. In particular in current WiMAX and LTE standards the network does not pass any content specific information e.g. rate distortion characteristics of the video stream associated video quality metrics etc. regarding the multimedia processing at the codec to the radio access network and core network. Instead the PHY MAC NET layers remain agnostic of application layer requirements and characteristics and only aim to optimize link quality subject to certain target QoS requirements e.g. throughput latency jitter packet error loss rate etc. .

The following description describes signaling techniques for multimedia aware radio and network adaptation. In the following description numerous specific details such as logic implementations resource partitioning or sharing or duplication implementations types and interrelationships of system components and logic partitioning or integration choices are set forth in order to provide a more thorough understanding of the present invention.

In one embodiment the wireless communication systems may support the cross layer functionalities required to provide application oriented QoE for multimedia delivery including the application aware PHY MAC NET adaptation. In one embodiment the wireless devices such as a mobile station may enable the higher layers to provide content specific information related to application layer to the lower layers including PHY MAC NET layers. In one embodiment the mobile station may allow the network layer or the transport layer to provide the content specific information e.g. rate distortion characteristics of the video stream associated video quality metrics related to the multimedia processing at the codec or the application layer to the core network and radio access network PHY MAC NET .

In one embodiment the wireless devices may also support QoS classes bearers and associated service attributes to include the QoE related metrics on application level multimedia processing. For example in addition to prioritization of traffic subject to QoS parameters provided by the existing dynamic service association change DSx mechanisms other information such as multimedia specific application layer information or multimedia quality metrics e.g. peak signal to noise ratio PSNR for video may be exchanged between the client and network to enabling joint source channel coding JSCC based optimizations. In one embodiment the JSCC based optimization of multimedia transmission may include for example distortion aware resource allocation or distortion aware link adaptation performed at the core network or access network performed based on the knowledge of application layer information such as multimedia quality requirements of the users. In one embodiment the cross layer functionalities and signaling mechanisms may support exchange of application level information for QoE aware radio and network adaptation and resource management for one or more service flows. In one embodiment the content specific information such as application layer parameters and QoE metrics may also be used to derive mappings between various QoS classes defined to prioritize traffic across different parts of the access network and core network.

In one embodiment based on the wireless device which initiates the signaling mechanism for QoS control may be classified as 1 terminal initiated or MS initiated and 2 network initiated or BS initiated . In one embodiment in the terminal initiated signaling mechanism a mobile station or a client may request creation of service flows with one or more multimedia specific application layer parameters and QoE attributes for both the downlink and the uplink traffic. In other embodiment in the network initiated signaling mechanism an application function provided within the base station may generate trigger signals which may be intended to set up service flows with one or more multi media specific application layer parameters along with the other QoE attributes. In one embodiment the base station may obtain information multimedia specific application layer parameters using the cross layer functionalities from the multimedia server using for example RTP headers HTTP headers IPV4 or IPV6 headers.

As a result of providing content specific information to the lower layers such as PHY and MAC and due to signaling mechanism used for QoS control the user QoE may be enhanced. The end to end distortion may be significantly reduced based on using the distortion aware link adaptation techniques described in detail below. Moreover for a fixed target user QoE more users may be supported over the network with fixed capacity resources based on using distortion aware resource allocation techniques described in detail below.

An embodiment of a block diagram of a communication system which may support cross layer functionalities required to provide application oriented QoE for multimedia delivery including the application aware PHY MAC NET adaptation in illustrated in . In one embodiment the communication system may include a source a joint source channel coding JSCC block a transmitter a channel a receiver a channel decoding block a source decoding block and a reconstructed source .

Typically source and channel coding operations may be performed at different communication layers and many conventional communication systems may implement the source coding entirely separately from the channel coding. That is source coding may be performed without taking into account the channel behavior and channel coding may be performed without considering the nature of the source. In general multimedia wireless communication involves transmitting analog sources over fading channels while satisfying end to end distortion and delay requirements of the application. For example delay limitedness accounts for the presence of stringent latency and buffer constraints. Accordingly separation of source and channel coding may not be optimal in general. The sub optimality of source and channel separation holds particularly when the channel state information CSI is not available at the transmitter or when finite coding block lengths are used due to practical system limitations.

In one embodiment the joint source channel coding technique may be used to provide distortion aware link adaptation in wireless systems for example toward the selection of modulation and coding parameters in multiple input multiple output MIMO systems. In the joint source channel coding according to implementations herein the source compression and channel coding may be performed together such that the end to end distortion for wireless multimedia communication may be minimized by accounting for the impact of both quantization errors due to lossy compression and channel induced errors due to fading and noise .

In one embodiment the JSCC block may perform joint source channel coding in response to receiving a multimedia or information signal from the source . In one embodiment the JSCC block may include a channel coding and resource allocation block a source coding block a routing resource allocation and transport block a cross layer functionality block that may accompany the source coding block a cross layer functionality block that may accompany the channel coding and resource allocation block and a cross layer functionality block that may accompany the routing resource allocation and transport block . In one embodiment the source coding block and the cross layer functionality block may be included in a multimedia server in a content distribution network and the channel coding and resource allocation block and the cross layer functionality block may be included in a radio access network. In one embodiment the routing resource allocation and transport block and the cross layer functionality block may be included in a core network. In one embodiment a channel decoding block and a source decoding block may be co located in a mobile client device receiving content from the multimedia server in the content distribution network. This setup is depicted in .

In other embodiment it may also be possible that the source coding block the channel coding and resource allocation block and the cross layer functionality block may belong to the same device e.g. they may be part of the mobile client device during an uplink wireless transmission from a mobile station or during peer to peer wireless communications between two client devices in which case the routing resource allocation and transport block and cross layer functionality blocks and may not be relevant . In one embodiment the source coding operations may be performed at multimedia servers in the content distribution network while the channel coding and resource allocation operations may be performed at the radio access network components such as base stations or access network gateways.

In one embodiment the source coding block which may use a codec such as H.264 AVC for example may perform source coding including compression and or encoding before providing the compressed signal to a channel coding and resource allocation which may use radio devices block . The source coding block may be configured to compress or otherwise encode a source such as a multimedia source to create source encoded data and pass the source encoded data along with the content specific information provided by the cross layer functionality block to the channel coding and resource allocation block in the radio access network through the cross layer functionality block . Furthermore the source encoded data along with the content specific information may also be provided by the cross layer functionality block to the routing resource allocation and transport block in the core network through the cross layer functionality block . For example if the source is a stream of video information the source coding block may encode e.g. compresses the received stream of video information into a format suitable e.g. H.264 MPEG 4 AVC video coding standard developed by the ITU T Video Coding Experts Group VCEG together with the ISO IEC Moving Picture Experts Group MPEG finalized May 2003 or the like for transmission. Furthermore in the case in which the source is an analog stream source coding block may further convert the analog stream into a digital form using an analog to digital converter during encoding.

In one embodiment the encoding carried out by the source coding block may at least partially depend upon the nature of the multimedia source as well as the compression capabilities of the codec or source encoder. Further in one embodiment the cross layer functionality block may provide the content specific information or facilitate the flow of content specific information from the source coding block to the channel coding and resource allocation block operating at lower layers through the cross layer functionality block . Moreover in one embodiment the cross layer functionality block may provide the content specific information or facilitate the flow of content specific information from the source coding block to the routing resource allocation and transport block operating at lower layers through the cross layer functionality block . In one embodiment the content specific information may include the application oriented QoE for multimedia delivery to be used for application aware link adaptation resource allocation routing and network control at the radio access network and core network. In one embodiment if the cross layer functionality block is operating in facilitating mode the content specific information may be used by the source coding block while generating the encoded source.

In one embodiment as a result of the cross layer functionalities provided by the cross layer functionality blocks and the content specific information i.e. application oriented QoE information for enhancing multimedia delivery using techniques such as application aware link adaptation and resource allocation included in the encoded source may be passed to the channel coding and resource allocation block and the block may take the content specific information into account for providing the application oriented QoE to channel coding and radio resource allocation process during the channel encoding of the source encoded data. For example the content specific information may be provided based on the multimedia application and passed to the channel coding and resource allocation block from the source coding block . In one embodiment the content specific information may be dependent on application and network layer functionalities such as frame type e.g. I frame P frame or B frame network layer packetization and transmission framework used toward passing the compressed source from the codec to the channel encoder e.g. in RTP UDP IP or HTTP TCP IP type of layering in the case of advanced source compression methods such as scalable video coding SVC and application layer forward error correction FEC e.g. raptor codes Reed Solomon codes etc. .

In one embodiment in addition the application layer parameters or the content specific information may also be included in the QoS class definitions in the air access network and core network interfaces. In one embodiment the QoS class definitions may be included in the QoS service classes bearers which may be exchanged between the access network and the mobile station MS or user equipment UE and in the QoS service classes at the core network level which may also be negotiated with the MS. In one embodiment the cross layer functionalities and the signaling mechanisms may be applicable to both downlink and the uplink communications for the unicast multicast and broadcast based multimedia services.

In one embodiment the channel coding and resource allocation block may perform frequency forward error correction FEC coding interleaving followed by a MIMO space time ST modulation block which may then be followed by a MIMO precoding to produce channel encoded data. Following pre coding the channel encoded data may be transmitted by multi antenna transmission to the receiver over the MIMO channel . In one embodiment the output bits generated after FEC coding and interleaving may be first modulated to generate symbols using for example quadrature amplitude modulation QAM and may then be re encoded using a space time code STC into multiple spatial streams. Alternatively the coded interleaved bits after FEC coding and interleaving may be de multiplexed into multiple spatial streams and each stream may then be modulated to generate symbols using QAM. In one embodiment the channel coding and resource allocation block may ensure that the link adaptation and resource allocation may be performed based on the application oriented QoE parameter values. In one embodiment the joint source channel encoded signal may be provided to the transmitter .

In one embodiment the transmitter may include a transmit processor block which in turn may include a signaling block . In one embodiment the transmit processor block may perform various processing tasks including the signaling tasks to prepare the source channel encoded signal for transmission over the air interface. In one embodiment the signaling block may generate or support signals to make the application layer parameters available in air access and core network interfaces.

In one embodiment the signaling block may support dynamic service change DSC mechanism to modify the parameters of an existing service flow using DSC REQ RSP ACK messages . In one embodiment the DSC mechanism may include one or more multimedia specific application level parameters along with other updates of QoE attributes or parameters. In one embodiment the multimedia specific application level parameters may be used for QoE aware scheduling and resource management over the radio access network and core network.

In one embodiment the QoS classes bearers enable a differentiation of the service flows between client applications and services. In one embodiment each service flow may be mapped to a specific QoS class and may each service flow may prioritized based on the QoS class while the resources may be distributed between the different service flows through scheduling functions.

In one embodiment the QoS definitions in the IP based access network and core network may include Differentiated Services DiffServ and Integrated Services IntServ . The IntServ may follow the flow based and signaled QoS model in which the mobile station may signal the QoS requirements to the base station . The DiffServ may follow the provisioned QoS model which may prioritize multiple classes of traffic with varying QoS requirements. The DiffServ may use Differentiated Services Code Point DSCP field in the header of IP packets for packet classification and IntServ may use Resource Reservation Protocol RSVP to reserve the desired QoS for each flow. In order to provide multi layer QoS control and manage end to end QoS a convergence sub layer may be used to interface with the higher layer protocol data units which may perform classification and mapping function. For example in one embodiment the convergence sub layer may be used to derive mappings between QoS classes for the core network and QoS classes for the radio access network . In other embodiment the derivation of QoS classes for the core network and the access network may be based on application layer parameters and QoE metrics retrieved from RTP HTTP IPv4 or IPv6 packet headers.

In one embodiment the inclusion of the parameters listed above in the QoS classes of interfaces of air access network and the core network may allow service flow differentiation for packets with multimedia content. For example 1 scalable video coding SVC encoded packets including a base layer may be given higher priority and such encoded packets may be delivered reliably compared to packets including an enhancement layer 2 packets with poor rate distortion characteristics may be prioritized over packets with better rate distortion characteristics 3 packets including an I frame may be given higher priority and may be delivered reliably compared to packets including P or B frames.
