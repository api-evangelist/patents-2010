Various embodiments relate to a method and system for notifying a vehicle occupant of local state and national emergencies. The vehicle occupant may also respond to the emergency notifications. In some embodiments the vehicle s location may be used to determine which notifications to present to the vehicle occupant.

Alerting the public of emergencies such as child abductions weather related emergencies and public safety emergencies is left to the local state and Federal governments to broadcast. Traditionally such alerts were broadcasted through television and radio.

Various examples in the field exist that provide ways of broadcasting public emergencies. As one example U.S. Publication No. 2009 0322560 to Tengler et al. discloses an in vehicle alert delivery maximizing communications efficiency and subscriber privacy. Specifically the publication discloses a system and method for enhancing subscriber privacy while delivering location based in vehicle alerts to the subscribers of a mobile traffic reporting system. This is accomplished by disassociating subscriber information from location information transmitted by a traffic probe vehicle. The in vehicle alerts include flash flood alerts hurricane alerts amber alerts as well as non crisis alerts such as traffic hotspots locations of inexpensive gas stations and various points of interest.

Another example is U.S. Publication No. 2009 0325538 to Sennett et al. disclosing a method for geo targeting emergency alerts. The publication specifically discloses that geo targeting may be used in combination with wireless alert capabilities to provide alerts to a more granulated geographical area. A system and method for performing geo targeting for various alert areas is discussed in the publication such that emergency messages may be delivered to mobile and static devices of different types in a localized area. As an example offered in the publication geo targeting supports the delivery area for wireless emergency alerts by identifying the cell sites that are in a specified geographic area that have technology capable of delivering wireless emergency alerts. The components of the telecommunications system that support a wireless emergency alert system may be identified and mapped to any geographical area.

Another example is U.S. Publication No. 2007 0139182 to O Connor et al. which discloses emergency communications for the mobile environment. The publication specifically discloses systems and methods for two way interactive communication regarding emergency notifications and responses for mobile environments. A specific geographic area is designated for selective emergency communications. The emergency communications may comprise text audio video and other types of data. The emergency notification is sent to users mobile communications devices such as in vehicle telematics units cellular phones personal digital assistants PDAs and laptops that are currently located in the designated area. The sender of the emergency message or the users service provider s may remotely control cameras and microphones associated with the users mobile communications devices. As an example offered in the publication a rear camera ordinarily used when driving in reverse may be used to capture images and video that may assist authorities in searching for a suspect. The users vehicles may send photographs or video streams of nearby individuals cars and license plates along with real time location information in response to the emergency notification. Image recognition algorithms may be used to analyze license plates vehicles and faces captured by the users cameras and determine whether they match a suspect s description.

Another example is U.S. Publication No. 2007 0265768 to Brown JR. disclosing a dash mounted or handheld audible visual road advisory information system device. The publication specifically discloses a dash mounted or handheld audible visual road advisory information system device for improving driver awareness and highway safety that outputs amber alert warning notices and highway advisory information. The device also provides a summary of businesses and contact numbers operating hours and detailed summaries of business services special sales and advertisements which are found located on a highway and at a highway exit. The information is presented in electronic voice through speaker and in text on display screen mounted either on the dash of a vehicle built inside a vehicle radio or a portable mobile handheld device.

One aspect includes a computer implemented method for communicating emergency information to a vehicle. The method includes receiving on a vehicle computer one or more emergency notifications e.g. government issued emergency notifications having a geographic attribute and further receiving GPS data. A geographic location of the vehicle based on the GPS data may be determined. Based on the geographic location of the vehicle and the geographic attribute at least one emergency notification is selected and output that the notification may be presented to the vehicle occupant.

In one embodiment a proximity of the vehicle to the geographic attribute may be received and or determined and the selected emergency notification output based on the proximity. In additional embodiments a distance parameter defining a distance from the geographic location of the vehicle may be utilized in outputting the emergency notification based on the distance parameter.

In some embodiments the geographic location of the vehicle may be based on a direction of travel of the vehicle.

Another aspect includes a computer program product for communicating emergency information in a vehicle. The computer program product may include instructions for receiving one or more emergency notifications having a geographic attribute and additionally receiving GPS data. The computer program product may also include instructions for determining the vehicle geographic location based on the GPS data and determining a direction of travel of the vehicle. Depending on the geographic location of the vehicle and the direction of travel one or more emergency notifications may be output which may be presented to a vehicle occupant.

The direction of travel may be determined based on the geographic attribute of the emergency notification s .

In some embodiments one or more emergency notifications may be output based on a default notification location which may or may not be defined by the vehicle occupant and the geographic attribute. In further embodiments the emergency notification may be output based on a distance parameter defining a distance from the default notification location.

In some embodiments the notification may be output until the vehicle occupant acknowledges the one or more emergency notifications. This may define an output priority of the notifications.

Another aspect includes a system comprising at least one data processor configured to receive emergency notifications and GPS data. The data processor may be further configured to determine a geographic location of the vehicle based on the GPS data. A selection of at least one emergency notification may be executed based on the vehicle s geographic location. The selected emergency notification may be transmitted so that the notification may be presented to a vehicle occupant.

In some embodiments the emergency notifications may include one or more images of a subject of the emergency notifications including but not limited to missing persons suspected criminals and or missing vehicles. In some embodiment the image may be a license plate.

These and other aspects will be better understood in view of the attached drawings and following detailed description of the invention.

Detailed embodiments of the invention are disclosed herein. However it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of an invention that may be embodied in various and alternative forms.

Therefore specific functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting but merely as a representative basis for the claims and or as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the present invention.

In an increasingly mobile society broadcasting public emergencies to a broad membership can be a challenge particularly to those members of the public who spend time travelling. One reason for this challenge is that subscribers of such information generally receive notifications in the areas defined in a subscription.

Another reason may be that alerts are based on static geographic data. That is alert may be transmitted to members of the public that are identified in particular geographic areas. For example if a member of the public travels from point A to point B and an emergency broadcast was transmitted in point B the member of the public may not receive the broadcast in point B because the member of the public was not identified as being in the geographic area. Therefore an emergency notification and response system and method that uses geographic data associated with a vehicle and or vehicle occupant as part of emergency notification broadcasts may be helpful.

Referring first to a vehicle enabled with the VCS may contain a visual front end interface located in the vehicle. The user may also be able to interact with the interface if it is provided for example with a touch sensitive screen. In another illustrative embodiment the interaction occurs through button presses audible speech and speech synthesis.

This could allow the CPU to connect to remote networks in range of the local router . Auxiliary device may include but are not limited to personal media players wireless health devices portable computers and the like.

Referring now to as described above the vehicle may be outfitted with the VCS e.g. a vehicle based data processor which may communicate and process data that it receives within the vehicle. The VCS furthermore may have installed programmed software logic for brokering emergency notifications and responses received by the VCS . The on board emergency notification and response broker may be programmed to the VCS and or installed as software from a computer readable medium including but not limited to CD ROMs DVDs flashdrives one or more servers and the like . The logic may be installed to the VCS by an OEM during vehicle production a vehicle dealer or a user e.g. a vehicle occupant after acquisition of the vehicle. In some embodiments the broker may be installed from a software repository or database.

The broker may be activated and operated during vehicle operation e.g. when the vehicle is powered . However the user may opt to turn off emergency notifications. Alternatively or additionally the broker may be activated in response to manual user activation e.g. via a tactile and or verbal activation instruction . When activated the broker via the VCS may communicate with an emergency notification system ENS from which it may receive emergency event notifications. The broker may communicate with the emergency notification system via wired or wireless communication. In one embodiment the communication may be via network . Network may be the communication network used by ENS for broadcasting emergency notifications as is known in the art. As a non limiting example network may be a cellular carrier. It will be appreciated that network and network may be the same or different networks but for clarity the networks are illustrated as being separate networks. In another embodiment the broker may communicate directly with the ENS via a communication network now or later known in the art.

In some embodiments the communication may additionally or alternatively include USB firewire WiFi WiMax cellular radio frequency RF BLUETOOTH and the like. In some further embodiments the VCS may include an application programming interface API permitting communication between the broker and the ENS .

In one embodiment the broker may be implemented in the ND . The ND may communicate with the VCS as described above. In this case the nomadic device may include an API for permitting communication between the nomadic device and the VCS . This API or an additional API implemented in the VCS may permit communication with the ENS . The broker may be installed to the nomadic device through similar methods described above.

The emergency notifications may include information associated with an emergency including but not limited to dates times geographic attributes e.g. and without limitation location information descriptions identification information severity of the condition and the like. Alternatively or additionally the emergency notifications may include images. The images may be of without limitation individuals vehicle license plate numbers vehicles weather conditions and other like images. Accordingly visuals may be provided in the emergency notification s .

The broker may receive emergency notifications from the ENS in a number of ways. As one non limiting example the broker may monitor the information from the ENS for new emergency notifications. In some embodiments when the emergency notifications are transmitted from the ENS the notifications may be stored in a database or other repository not shown which the broker monitors for the new updated emergency notifications. In this case the notifications may be transmitted by the ENS or an intermediary entity e.g. a cellular carrier at network .

In one embodiment emergency notifications may be stored in memory. As an example the modifications may be stored in memory or off board memory not shown . The broker may be programmed to identify new updated emergency notifications based on information from the emergency notifications stored in memory. This information may include but is not limited to keywords keyphrases graphics images and the like. Further a combination of information may be utilized.

As the broker monitors the ENS for new notifications the broker may use the information or a combination of information obtained from the stored notifications to determine which notification s from the ENS are new. This may be accomplished using logic programmed to the broker . This logic may be without limitation text recognition logic speech recognition logic and or image recognition logic. Text speech recognition logic may include the recognition of numeric characters alphabetic characters speech alphanumeric characters speech and the like. The recognition information may be alternatively stored in a lookup table not shown on the VCS along with an identifier e.g. and without limitation a numeric alphabetic or alphanumeric identifier identifying each notification.

To determine if a new notification has been issued by the ENS the broker may compare the stored notification s with notifications from the ENS using the information or combination of information . In one embodiment where there is a match the broker does not receive the notification s . Alternatively where there is no match the broker may receive and store the notification s . In another embodiment the notification may be received regardless of there being a match. In this case the information from the stored notification s may be used to identify the new notification so that the vehicle occupant may be notified that a new notification has been received.

As an example stored notifications may be associated with keyword information. For example if the notification is an AMBER alert the abducted child s name may be used as a keyword. The keyword may be associated with the notifications when stored in memory. When the broker monitors the notifications received from the ENS the keyword may be used to determine if the incoming notification has already been received or there is an update to the notification s .

As another example stored notifications may include an image such as of a missing person . When the broker monitors the notifications received from the ENS image processing of the store notification s may be accomplished to determine if the incoming notification s has been received or an update exists.

The ENS may be monitored periodically by the broker . For example the monitoring may occur hourly daily weekly bi monthly or based on other periodic patterns. Further the stored notifications may be periodically presented to the user. The period may be predetermined and set by an OEM a dealer or the vehicle occupant.

The broker may additionally or alternatively receive emergency notifications by transmitting requests to the ENS . These requests may be transmitted periodically.

In one embodiment the broker may track which notifications are stored in memory and send one or more requests to the ENS to receive new and or updated notifications. The broker may track the stored notifications using information associated with the stored notifications as described above keyword keyphrases etc. . Additionally or alternatively the stored notifications may be associated with time and date information. For example and without limitation each stored notification may include a time and or date stamp which may be associated with the notification s when stored. Using the information associated with each stored notification the broker may request for new or updated notifications. As a non limiting example using the date stamp the broker may request for notification s that are dated after the date of a stored notification. In one embodiment the broker may receive all notifications in response to a request and the new and or updated notifications may be filtered and identified by the broker

In one embodiment the broker may receive from the ENS specific types of notifications. For example the broker may receive only weather related notifications. As another example the broker may only receive AMBER alerts within a geographic area. It will be appreciated that the broker may receive one or multiples types of alerts notifications. The types of notifications which the broker receives may be determined based on the subscription profile of the vehicle occupant. The subscription profiles are described below with respect to . Alternatively or additionally the notifications that are received may be predetermined. For example the broker may be programmed to always receive certain types of notifications e.g. AMBER alerts catastrophic weather emergencies etc. .

Some notifications may expire. As such the stored notifications may be presented until the notification s expire. Once notification s expire they may be deleted from memory. As an example weather related emergencies may include a time and date that the weather advisory is in effect. Once this time date has passed the stored notifications may be deleted from memory.

It will be appreciated that emergency notifications may also be received and identified without stored notifications on the VCS . However in some embodiments the notification s may be filtered as described above e.g. based on specific notification types identified in the subscription profile .

The notifications may be presented audibly or visually. For example an emergency notification may be presented in a spoken language through speaker . Text speech technology may be used as known in the art for audibly outputting notification. Alternatively speech to text technology may be used as known in the art for visually outputting notifications. It will be appreciated that audible notifications may also be presented as beeps chimes and other audible sounds signifying the presence of one or more emergency notifications. As another example the emergency notification s may be displayed on the display e.g. and without limitation pop ups scrolling text graphics images and the like . The notifications may include text numbers images graphics or a combination of these visuals. Further details of the presentation process are described below with respect to .

A priority may be assigned to the emergency notifications defining the output priority given to the notification s . As such the notification s may be presented so as to catch the attention of the vehicle occupant and may not be removed deleted until the user acknowledges the notification s . An acknowledgment may include but is not limited to storing the notification s deleting the notification s minimizing the notification s submitting an acknowledgment e.g. touching an ok button on the touchscreen display or saying ok and the like. It will be appreciated that these examples are for explanation and therefore are not intended to be limiting. Further the types of acknowledgments may be varied without departing from the scope of the invention.

As an example of output priority a pop up may be displayed and given focus on the display until the user acknowledges the pop up. As another non limiting example the notification may be verbalized through the speaker repeatedly and in some embodiments frequently until the user acknowledges the notification. As another non limiting example a beep or chime may be repeatedly or periodically played e.g. every minute signifying the presence of the notification s . The beep or chime may be played until the user requests via an audible and or tactile command the notification s . The notification s may be presented acknowledged.

The notification s may be presented to the user automatically and or in response to manual input. Automatic presentation of the notification s is described above. In the case of manual notification the vehicle occupant may navigate a menu on the VCS to retrieve the notifications. Menu navigation may be performed through tactile inputs and or spoken inputs. For example the vehicle occupant may use a touchscreen display to navigate the menu. Alternatively or additionally the vehicle occupant may use spoken commands.

In some embodiments the vehicle occupant may also use manual inputs to search the notifications stored in the VCS . Notifications may be stored on the VCS until they are deleted in response to for example manual deletion and or notification expiration.

Emergency notifications may be received in the vehicle whether or not the vehicle has been started i.e. is powered . For example if the vehicle is powered off and therefore not running the VCS may nevertheless receive sufficient power from the vehicle s battery to receive the notifications. In either case the received notification s may be queued in memory. When the vehicle is powered and or the notification service is activated the notification s may be transmitted from the queue and presented to the user. The notification message s may be queued according to methods known in the art.

Referring back to the ENS may be any government community or other public agency issuing emergency notifications. In some embodiments the ENS may be comprised of terminals servers networks and databases for exchanging data to and from the VCS . The specific configuration of the ENS may be arranged according to various implementations without departing from the scope of the invention.

As described above the emergency notifications may be presented on display and or through speaker . Further details of the presentation process are described below with respect to .

The broker may use GPS data received from a satellite . As will be further described below the GPS data may be used to target emergency notifications according to the geographic area of the vehicle . The geographic area may be the vehicle occupant s default or home location as defined by the user one or more areas along a route or both. The geographic area may comprise different levels of granularity such as street zip code city county state and national areas.

A vehicle occupant may contact a public safety access point PSAP from the vehicle in response to receiving an emergency notification. The vehicle occupant may do so using traditional methods e.g. manually placing a call from the ND . Alternatively the vehicle occupant may do so via a command instructing a connection to the PSAP . Commands may be audible and or tactile. For example the command may be to place a call to the PSAP or send a textual message e.g. an electronic mail message text message or instant message IM . In one embodiment the emergency notification s may include a link button or other input for contacting the PSAP . For example a notification presented on display may include an input which when selected results in a call being placed to the PSAP . As another example the input may be an input which causes a textual message to be sent to the PSAP . In the case of textual messages the broker may be programmed to generate a message using the VCS or ND built in messaging tools. Alternatively the broker may generate message s using messaging tools located e.g. on a remote server not shown via network . The PSAP may respond to the message with a call and or with return textual message s .

A PSAP may be any agency responsible for responding to emergencies including but not limited to a fire department police departments or any other agency associated with an emergency call. Further details of the communication with the PSAP will be described below.

In the embodiments described above the broker is an on board broker. In an alternative embodiment the emergency notification brokering system may be an off board broker . An off board broker may be a media broadcasting service e.g. radio and or television or an emergency notification service provider e.g. an OEM . In one embodiment the off board broker may entirely accomplish the tasks and operations described above and in further detail below for emergency notification and response. In this case the VCS and or the ND may have installed one or more application programs for enabling various functions associated with emergency notification and response. In other embodiments there may be both an on board and an off board broker such that e.g. a broker operates in conjunction with a broker

An OEM may desire to collect usage information for the system . Accordingly a usage database may collect usage information from the on board or off board broker . The usage information may be for gathering data on calls messages to the PSAP the number and or types of notifications issued during a period of time and or in one or more geographic areas and the like. The usage information may be collected by the database based on a flag message or other usage identifier transmitted to the database in response to a usage event e.g. a call placed to the PSAP .

It will be appreciated that the disclosure and arrangement of may be modified or re arranged to best fit a particular implementation of the various embodiments of the invention. Further it will be appreciated that the profile information and the configuration information may be provided and or modified during or after initial registration.

A vehicle occupant may enter user profile information block and vehicle profile information block so that the broker may identify the user and the vehicle respectively. The user profile information may include information to identify the vehicle occupant s . As an example the user profile information may include a mobile identification number MIN associated with the vehicle occupant s nomadic device. Other information may include but is not limited to names and addresses of the user.

Vehicle profile information may include information about the vehicle . This information may include a vehicle identifier such as a vehicle identification number VIN associated with the vehicle. In addition to identifying the vehicle this VIN may be used to register for subscribe to vehicle based services. Accordingly the vehicle profile information may further include the vehicle based services enabled in the vehicle. These vehicle based services may be transmitted according to well known methods to the vehicle over a wired or wireless connection between the VCS and the device used for generating the profile. Non limiting examples of these wired or wireless connections are provided above.

The vehicle based services may additionally or alternatively be associated with the ND using the MIN. In this case the vehicle based services may be operated via the ND e.g. through a mobile application . Alternatively the vehicle based services may be associated with the vehicle and the ND using the VIN and the MIN respectively. For example and without limitation the MIN may be used to identify the user of the service s and the VIN may be used to identify which service s are enabled. This may provide for example a multiple authentication process.

The emergency notification service may be a default or automatic opt in service offered to the vehicle occupant. Accordingly the vehicle occupant may choose to opt out of the emergency notification service block . However it will be appreciated the user may choose to opt in or opt out of the emergency notification service without departing from the scope of the invention.

As illustrated in block if the user chooses to opt out emergency notifications may not be received. In some embodiments despite an opt out the user may nevertheless receive emergency notifications such as notifications that may be mandatory or may be a critical emergency. The broker may be programmed to identify these notifications based on information associated with the notifications.

If the user does not opt out the user may configure the emergency notification service as represented by blocks and . As illustrated in block the notification preferences may be configured. For example a default or home notification location may be defined. The home notification location may be the geographic location s for which the vehicle occupant regularly receives emergency notifications. The location s may be automatically determined e.g. based on the user profile information and or GPS information or may be input by the user. This location may be based on where the user lives works or may be another location input by the user.

A radius or distance defining the area that the emergency notifications are received by a vehicle occupant may also be provided. For example emergency notifications may be presented for emergencies that are within X distance measured in e.g. miles kilometers meters etc. of the home location. As another example emergencies may be presented for emergencies that are within X distance of the vehicle s location e.g. if not in the home location or there is no home location .

It will be appreciated that in some embodiments the geographic parameters may be predetermined. Other geographic parameters and the process of broadcasting emergencies are described in further detail with respect to .

As part of the notification targeting process the broker may determine the geographic coverage area of the notification based on the information in the notification. This may be referred to as a geographic attribute associated with the emergency notifications. Emergency notifications include a region or regions e.g. county or state that are effected by the emergency notifications. The broker may intercept e.g. from a data transmission or interpret e.g. from the notifications this information to determine the regions effected. In one embodiment a lookup table or a map database be used in the determination.

As illustrated in block the vehicle occupant s communication preferences may be entered and stored for communicating with the PSAP . As described above a phone call may be placed or text based messages may be transmitted. The communication preference set by the user may be the default communication used. The user may also override the default and choose the communication mode from the VCS e.g. before or during the communication event.

In either case the broker may determine if the vehicle is within the specified geographic parameters for broadcasting emergency notifications block . Some non limiting examples are provided above. The geographic parameters may also be based on the location of the vehicle in a particular city county state or region of the country. It will be appreciated that if the broker is off board the determination may be made by application software on board as described above .

Additionally or alternatively the geographic parameters may include a proximity of the vehicle to the emergency as defined by a geographic attribute defined in the emergency notifications. For example the decision to present the emergency notification s to the vehicle occupant may be based on the proximity of the vehicle to the last known location of the suspect or the abducted child as may be defined in or with the emergency notification s . As another example the decision may be based on the proximity to a tornado. It should be understood that the location of the vehicle may be determined based on GPS data and or other location determining methods known in the art. Further it will be appreciated that the various geographic parameters e.g. distance parameters and proximity parameters may be used in combination.

As described above the broker may determine the coverage area of the notifications. Using this information the broker may determine if the vehicle s geographic location parameters fall in the coverage area of the notification s . For example and without limitation the broker may determine if the notification region and the geographic location parameters correspond.

If the vehicle is not within the geographic location a further determination may be made if the vehicle is moving toward the geographic location block . If not the notification s may not be presented block . In some embodiments however the notification s may be stored in on board off board memory.

If the vehicle is travelling toward the geographic location a further determination may be made if the geographic location has been reached block . For example reaching the geographic location may include travelling within the specified radius crossing the state border travelling within the proximity distance and the like. In some embodiments the notification message s may be queued in a message queue until the geographic location is reached block .

If the geographic location is not reached the broker may continue to monitor if the vehicle is moving toward the geographic location block . If there is a message queue the notification s may remain in the message queue. If the vehicle has reached the geographic location the notification s may be presented to the vehicle occupant block . The notification s may be presented until the notification s are acknowledged by the vehicle occupant.

In one embodiment as the vehicle is travelling toward the geographic location different levels of detail relating to the emergency may be presented to the vehicle occupant. For example if the vehicle is a Y distance from the geographic location the vehicle occupant may be presented audible and or visual with a message that says You are approaching an emergency notification area. As the vehicle travels closer to the geographic location additional details may be presented to the vehicle occupant. Of course when the geographic location is reached an emergency notification with full details may be presented.

Additionally or alternatively as the vehicle travels closer to the geographic location the priority of the emergency notification may increase. For example as the vehicle is travelling toward the geographic location the message may be displayed for a particular period of time e.g. a few seconds and removed from the display without an acknowledgment. However when the vehicle reaches the geographic location the message may be locked on the display until acknowledged by the vehicle occupant. As another example the message may be presented audibly or visually less frequently until the geographic location is reached. When the geographic location is reach the notification may be presented repeatedly and in some embodiments frequently and an acknowledgment may be required.

Referring back to block if the vehicle is within the geographic location a further determination may be made if the vehicle is travelling away from the location block . If so the notification s may be presented to the vehicle occupant until the vehicle is outside of the geographic location block . If the vehicle is not travelling away from the geographic location the notification s may be presented to the vehicle occupant as illustrated in block . In either case the vehicle occupant may acknowledge the notification s .

In some embodiments the process of may also be used to present stored notifications. For example notifications may be stored on board or off board and presented to the user periodically e.g. and without limitation daily until the notification s expire and or an update has been received from the ENS regarding a change in status of the emergency e.g. the emergency has been resolved .

While exemplary embodiments are illustrated and described above it is not intended that these embodiments illustrate and describe all possibilities. Rather the words used in the specification are words of description rather than limitation and it is understood that various changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
