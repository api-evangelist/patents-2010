The present invention relates to a low cost p type semiconductor. More particularly the present invention relates to a Bi Se doped with Cu p type semiconductor preferably for use in photovoltaic devices.

Although photovoltaic devices are poised to provide clean renewable energy for the future production costs have limited the potential of this technology. Photovoltaics convert light into usable electricity using the photovoltaic effect. Briefly two basic steps are involved in the photovoltaic effect. Initially light is absorbed by an absorber material a semiconductor. The absorption of the light generates electrons and holes. Secondly the electrons and holes are separated by a built in electric field for example a p n junction. The electrons generated at the p n junction flow towards the n type material which can be captured as produced electricity.

The primary semiconductor absorber materials generally found in existing photovolatics currently employ materials such as amorphous silicon a Si copper indium gallium diselenide CIGS and cadmium telluride CdTe . These materials have well known drawbacks including the employment of toxic nonabundant and expensive raw materials that limit their successful commercial deployment. Therefore there exists a need in the art for a suitable absorber material that is made of abundant and low cost materials that are nontoxic.

Preferably p type semiconductor layers with compositions up to 28 mole percent of copper are prepared by varying copper concentration in the solution A from 0 mM l to 30 mM l.

The pH of the reacting solution is preferably maintained in the range of 8 to 9. In one alternate embodiment sodium hydroxide NaOH and or ammonium hydroxide NHOH is used to increase the pH up to 12. CuBiSelayers are deposited on substrates at temperature in the range of room temperature 25 C. to 100 C.

Where TEA is an abbreviation for Triethanolamine a chelating agent used in this case to dissolve Bismuth cations in aqueous solution.

Table 1 lists sample embodiments that were prepared using chemical deposition. As shown each semiconductor layer is listed with the following columns in the following order sample name composition mole percentages of Cu Bi and Se Cu Bi ratio layer thickness determined semiconductor type by Hall coefficient and or Seebeck coefficient and thermal treatment. The layers were prepared by chemical bath deposition as described above at temperature of 40 C. 50 C. Layers were deposited from 9 hours to 35 hours. Copper rich layers are deposited for longer time than bismuth rich layers. As examples the BiSelayer was deposited for 9 hours while CuBiSeand CuBiSelayers were deposited for 22 hours and 35 hours respectively.

Composition mole percentages were determined using x ray fluoroscopy XRF having a resolution of 1 mole percentage for Cu 1 mole percentage for Bi and 2 mole percentage for Se. Therefore all values listed include at least a variance of 1 mole percentage for Cu 1 mole percentage for Bi and 2 mole percentage for Se.

The Hall coefficient are deduced from Hall effect measurements performed in the dark and at room temperature by the Van der Pauw Hall method with four probes on 1 cmlayers using an Accent machine. Indium metal dots are used as contact materials. The Hall effect characterizes a sample of semiconductor material. The measurement of the Hall coefficient can be successfully completed with a current source voltmeter and a magnet. From the measurements made the following properties of the material were calculated i the sheet resistance from which the resistivity can be inferred for a sample of a given thickness ii the doping type i.e. if it is a p type or n type material deduced from the sign of the coefficient iii the sheet carrier density of the majority carrier the number of majority carriers per unit area iv the mobility of the majority carrier.

NSC is an abbreviation for not significant coefficient. NP is an abbreviation for not performed because the Hall measurement gave a significantly negative coefficient.

The Seebeck coefficients were determined from electrical measurements performed in the dark with two probes on a 0.5 0.8 cmlayers. The Seebeck coefficient is a thermoelectric measure of the magnitude of voltage produced by a temperature gradient across a material. In semiconductors temperature differences induce majority carriers holes for p type or electrons for n type to diffuse from the hotter area of the gradient to the cooler area. The movement of carriers creates a DC potential namely the Seebeck coefficient for electrons the voltage or coefficient is negative and for holes this is a positive voltage. The Seebeck measurement setup is constituted of a heater and a split ferromagnetic chuck to create a temperature gradient on the semiconducting layers. In general Seebeck measurements are known to be more sensitive to the carrier movement than Hall measurements.
