title: Quick-release spindle for gun tube
abstract: The breech end of a gun may include a quick-release spindle assembly. A carrier may have a locking collar rotatably disposed therein. The locking collar may have a through-bore and one or more projections extending into the through-bore. The locking collar may be rotatable between spindle lock and spindle release positions. A spindle may be translatably disposed in the through-bore of the locking collar. The spindle may include one or more projections extending radially outward from a rear outer surface of the spindle. In the spindle lock position of the locking collar, the projections of the spindle may be aligned with the projections of the locking collar to thereby prevent translation of the spindle in a forward direction. In the spindle release position of the locking collar, the projections of the spindle may not be aligned with the projections of the locking collar to thereby allow translation of the spindle in a forward direction.

The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

The invention relates in general to munitions and in particular to guns that may fire caseless ammunition.

A gun such as for example a cannon may fire either cased or caseless ammunition. A gun having a firing chamber for caseless ammunition may include an obturation assembly. The obturation assembly may seal the rear end of the firing chamber when a propellant charge is combusted to launch a projectile. On the other hand for guns that fire cased ammunition the sealing may be performed by the case of the ammunition itself held in position by a breech block.

A conventional obturation assembly is described in U.S. Pat. No. 2 482 865 issued on Sep. 27 1949 to Oliver. A conventional obturation assembly may include a spindle having a shaft and a mushroom shaped head and an obturation set. The obturation set may include a resilient obturator pad for mating with and sealing against an obturation seat an inner ring and two retaining split rings. The obturation seat may be defined by the rim of the mouth at the rear end of the firing chamber.

When the spindle is displaced axially relative to the barrel of the gun by the combustion of the propellant charge in the firing chamber the obturator pad may deform radially outward into sealing engagement with the obturation seat. The retaining rings may limit the deformation of the obturator pad and may prevent extrusion of the obturator pad. The obturation assembly may be held in position by the breech block of the gun. The shaft of the spindle may extend through a hole in a carrier abutting the breech block.

A known method of removing the spindle from the gun may be time consuming may involve the removal of many other associated parts and may require the use of specialized tools. Moreover the method may be repetitive because the obturator pad and split rings may need to be removed every day for cleaning and for wear and damage inspection. Spindle removal may be accomplished by unscrewing a nut type of component from the threaded breech end of a spindle.

Some spindle retaining technology may be complex and may involve the use of many components. The spindle may be keyed to prevent it from turning and the spindle nut may have a flip key to keep it from unscrewing. Behind the face of the spindle may be an obturator pad assembly and then a breech block. The breech block may be held to the carrier by a nut like component. Often there may be other devices on the back of the carrier which may have to be removed to access the nut that holds the spindle. These other devices may also require reinstallation after the spindle is reinstalled. Consequently removal of the traditional spindle may take several minutes.

There is a need for a quick release spindle that may be rapidly removed and installed with minimal involvement of other components.

It is an object of the invention to provide a quick release spindle that may be rapidly removed and installed with minimal involvement of other components.

One aspect of the invention is an apparatus for a breech end of a gun that fires caseless ammunition. The apparatus may include a carrier having a locking collar rotatably disposed therein. The locking collar may have a through bore and at least one projection extending into the through bore. The locking collar may be rotatable between spindle lock and spindle release positions.

A spindle may be translatably disposed in the through bore of the locking collar. The spindle may include an enlarged portion at a forward end thereof for engaging an obturator pad assembly. The spindle may have a central bore and at least one projection extending radially outward from a rear outer surface of the spindle.

In the spindle lock position of the locking collar the at least one projection of the spindle may be aligned with the at least one projection of the locking collar to thereby prevent translation of the spindle in a forward direction. In the spindle release position of the locking collar the at least one projection of the spindle may not be aligned with the at least one projection of the locking collar to thereby allow translation of the spindle in the forward direction.

A handle may be fixed to the locking collar for rotating the locking collar between the spindle lock and the spindle release positions. The handle may extend through the carrier.

The carrier may include a spindle lock hole a spindle release hole and a slot formed between the spindle lock hole and the spindle release hole. The handle may be rotatable between the spindle lock hole and the spindle release hole by way of the slot. The handle may include a spring loaded sleeve for locking the handle in one of the spindle lock hole and the spindle release hole.

The handle may have a central member fixed to the locking collar. The spring loaded sleeve may be disposed around the central member. The spring loaded sleeve may include a spring with one end that bears against one end of the spring loaded sleeve and another end that bears against a top of the central member.
