The present invention is directed generally to apparatuses methods and systems of human resource management and more particularly to APPARATUSES METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR AN EMPLOYEE REIMBURSEMENT EVALUATOR.

Employees within a company are often called upon to expend personal money on behalf of the company and then to seek reimbursement for those expenditures at a later time. In order to request reimbursement an employee may be required to fill out a form providing information about the amount and nature of the expenditure in order to inform the judgment of an administrator who may decide whether or not a particular reimbursement request should be fulfilled. In many cases employees may be required to substantiate their reimbursement requests by providing receipts or other evidence of the expenditures for which they seek compensation.

The APPARATUSES METHODS AND SYSTEMS FOR AN EMPLOYEE REIMBURSEMENT EVALUATOR hereinafter EREVAL implement efficient and scalable monitoring regulation and allocation of computational processing data labor and or the like resources within an enterprise. In some embodiments the EREVAL may facilitate the receipt processing evaluation and fulfillment of employee reimbursement requests. In some implementations the EREVAL may be configured to receive an employee reimbursement request extract request parameters and evaluate whether or not the request can be fulfilled according to system rules based on employee characteristics and or employee selected benefits and or the like. The EREVAL may further be configured to interact with and or exploit global data exchanger and or automated date extractor components to retrieve reimbursement requests from employee email records and or to facilitate payment of authorized employee reimbursements.

In various implementations and embodiments EREVAL systems may facilitate generation and maintenance of a universal business data library a descriptive business grammar linked to and substantially tracking tables within the universal business data library and search methodologies based thereon a global data exchange and universal data mapping tool an automated data extractor accounting journal entry automation and a chart report clarifier elimination of cash reconciliation requirements invoice generation a global payroll engine cost center automation and graphical management a universal payment integrator transactional tagging thin client virtualization tailored application provision and device configuration softphone configuration and personalization storage configuration user interface configuration and personalization rules based world wide web restriction call recording and searching payclock virtualization call restriction and regulation disclosure and or disclaimer automation rules based referral bonus generation and payment tracking emotional aptitude evaluation streamlined labor resource allocation purse based global benefits planning universal form resources an integrated employee training platform automatic reimbursement facilitation graphical interactive voice response system programming hardware asset utilization tracking and reporting target contact estimation tools strategic auto dialing estimation tools for payment collection efficacy action sequence tools for collection strategy implementations and or the like and use of the EREVAL.

In one embodiment an employee reimbursement administering processor implemented method is disclosed comprising receiving a reimbursement request comprising at least an employee identifier and a plurality of reimbursement parameters querying a rules database based on the employee identifier to retrieve at least one benefit rule applying the at least one benefit rule to the plurality of reimbursement parameters to determine a reimbursement authorization and instructing payment of a reimbursement to an employee associated with the employee identifier when the reimbursement authorization is positive.

Appendix A includes further details of an implementation of hierarchically arranged universal variables for a universal data library in one embodiment of EREVAL operation.

The leading number of each reference number within the drawings indicates the figure in which that reference number is introduced and or detailed. As such a detailed discussion of reference number would be found and or introduced in . Reference number is introduced in etc.

In one embodiment the EREVAL includes facilities for thin client virtualization and application tailoring based on user identities and or profiles. In one implementation a EREVAL computing environment may include a local office and or collection of client terminals wherein each client terminal operated by a user may comprise a thin client. In one implementation the thin client may have no operating system initially installed. The computing environment may further include a projection server communicatively coupled to the plurality of client terminals in the local office. In one implementation the projection server may be situated locally with respect to the plurality of client terminals . In one implementation the projection server may comprise a plurality of servers configured as a cloud computing facility. The computing environment may further include a central office facility comprising one or more data and or authentication servers . A data server in the central office may maintain and or provide access to a central database which may include master copies of one or more operating systems applications data files and or database tables and or the like. In one implementation the data server may supply a so called Golden Master or Golden Image to the projection server such as on a periodic basis whenever requested by the projection server whenever updates are made and or the like. The Golden Image may in one implementation include an operating system destined for installation on one or more client terminals. The Golden Master may include additional files as well in various implementations such as an authentication application seed and or compressed files for other applications .NET framework files and or the like. The data server may further provide a plurality of application files application file updates data values and or updates and or the like to the projection server which may be destined for installation and or use on one or more of the client terminals. The projection server may store received application files data and or the like in a projection server database . In one implementation the data server may directly exchange data with one or more client terminals including updated data values records stored in the central database and or the like. In one implementation application files may be virtualized prior to installation on the client terminals. In one implementation application virtualization may be achieved using VMWare Thinapp. In one implementation application virtualization occurs after application files are received at the projection server. In an alternative implementation application files are virtualized at the central office and virtualized application files are then provided to the projection server.

At power on a client terminal may be configured to boot from a communications network instead of from any local disk. In one implementation a Preboot Execution Environment PXE boot may be engaged to boot the client terminal from the network wherein the client polls for contains and or is provided an address on the network to obtain boot information and or to send a boot request. The client terminal s boot request may be relayed to the projection server which in turn may provide elements of the Golden Image such as operating system files application and or authentication seed files .NET framework files and or the like for installation at the client terminal. Authentication seed files may then allow a user to submit authentication information in order to identify the user and or initiate provision of further files and or application use authorizations. In one implementation the client terminal may be equipped with one or more biometric login devices e.g. fingerprint and or palmprint scanner retina scanner facial recognition scanner earshape recognition scanner voice recorder typing rhythm analyzer and or the like configured to admit biometric data associated with a user . In one example embodiment a Digital Persona U.are.U. Fingerprint Reader is employed which captures an image of the users fingerprint converts it to a binary format and provides it via a Digital Persona service to the Authentication Control Server server for authentication. In one implementation software used to engage the one or more biometric login devices is provided from the Golden Image by the projection server to the client terminal after a boot request is made. In one implementation other authentication measures may be used in place of and or in addition to biometric authentication such as use of a password key device secret question and or the like.

The user may engage the biometric login device and or any other authentication measures to submit user identification information to an authentication server such as may be located at a central office . The authentication server may then verify and or authenticate the user identification information such as by comparing it against stored user identification information e.g. as may be stored in a central database ensuring a match beyond a specified threshold and or the like. If a match is detected the authentication server may query a database e.g. the central database for a matching user s profile to determine user access authorizations contained therein such as a package of applications that should be provided to the user. In one implementation the EREVAL may employ Microsoft Active Directory for administration of user access and authorizations which may run on the Data Server. Based on the user identifier ID and or information in an associated user profile the EREVAL may determine one or more applications that the user is permitted to access. In one implementation the applications a user may access may be correlated with one or more of a user s company a user s department a user s employment position a user s location a user s assignment and or the like. The authentication server may provide an instruction to the projection server to provide authorized application files to the client terminal at which the user is logged in. In turn the projection server may provide application files such as in the form of executable virtualized application files to the client terminal at which the user is logged in. In one implementation the user my be required to periodically re enter login and or authentication information to ensure that they are still the user of that client terminal and that another user has not taken their place.

A client terminal may be booted such as on machine startup to initiate a network e.g. PXE boot passing a boot request over the network such as to the projection server . The projection server in turn may monitor and or determine whether a boot request has been received . If not the projection server may wait for a period of time before checking again for a boot request . In one embodiment the boot request may be configured in accordance with the Preboot Execution Environment PXE Specification v.2.1 standard.

Once the request is received the projection server may pass files and or data to the client terminal such as by employing HP Image Manager. In one implementation the projection server may provide all or aspects of the Golden Image to the client terminal such as operating system files .NET framework files Java files and or the like application seed files authentication and or login input e.g. biometric files and or the like. The client starts the boot process and begins to copy and unpackage the materials provided from the projection server. Using files received from the projection server which have now been executed instantiated a user at the client terminal may login and or otherwise generate a user ID . In one implementation the user ID generated at comprises a biometric user ID such as but not limited to a thumbprint or scan a print or scan of any other finger combination of fingers part of the palm and or the like an iris or retina scan facial image scan earshape image scan voice audio data and or the like. For example one of the packages received at the thin client may be DigitalPersona Pro and or other thumbprint device drivers and capture programs. The generated user ID may then be passed to the authentication and or data server s e.g. by sending it via FTP HTTP Post SSH FTPS SFTP HTTPS another Digital Persona service and or the like which may then determine whether the received ID is valid . For example the send message may include an image converted to binary format and may be sent to a server side component of DigitalPersona Pro fingerprint authentication application which will perform the recognition identification of the biometric identifier. In one implementation this determination may be made based on a comparison of the received ID with stored IDs stored ID formatting information and or the like. If the user ID is determined to be invalid at an error handling procedure may be undertaken a request may be transmitted for reentry and or retransmission of the user ID information and or the like .

For valid user IDs the authentication and or data server s may access user information and or a user profile associated with the user ID . Accessed user information may then be used to determine which applications to include in a tailored application package for that user . For example in one implementation a user profile may have fields identifying authorized applications for that user. In another implementation profile fields may be compared with application access fields defined separately for the applications and those applications having appropriately matching fields with the user profile may be selected for that user. For example a user profile and or other user information may in one implementation identify a department code program code and or the like structured syntax string associated with the user e.g. as may be see in and various applications may also have associations with various department codes program codes and or the like. The authentication and or data server s may then in this implementation instruct provision applications sharing one or more department codes program codes and or the like with those of the user to the user s client terminal. In one implementation some or all of the determination of which applications to provide to the user may take place at the projection server and the authentication and or data server s may provide sufficient information to the projection server to allow it to complete the identification of user appropriate applications.

Once the appropriate package of applications is determined for the user the authentication and or data server s may pass an instruction message to the projection server the message comprising in one implementation specification of applications to be provided to the user. The projection server may receive the instruction and select a package of tailored application files to provide to the client terminal . In one implementation the projection server may select and provide to the client terminal a plurality of virtualized application executable files corresponding to selected applications. For example shows an implementation of a user interface for specifying user application privileges in one embodiment of EREVAL operation. The user interface provides a system administrator with facilities to specify a policy rule and or the like delineating which employees groups of employees third parties and or the like should receive which applications and or application packages. In the illustrated implementation a user may specify at a client and or group of clients to which a particular specified application distribution and or access rule and or policy should be applied. The application may be specified at and characteristics of users employees groups departments and or the like who should receive and or be allowed to use that application may be specified at . For example access characteristics may include an employee title an employee function an employee subfunction a department as may be specified by a department code which is discussed in further detail below and with reference to a program as may be specified by a program code which is discussed in further detail below and with reference to an employee name and or the like. The interface therefore provides both for specification of application privileges for wide classes of users as well as for user friendly exception handling whereby a single user or highly specific class of users may be given special access privileges as needed.

In some implementations application files received from the authentication and or data server s at may be virtualized at the projection server such as via application of VMWare s Thinapp to the application files to yield virtualized application executables such as in .EXE format. In another implementation application files may be virtualized at the authentication and or data server s and the virtualized application executables provided to the projection server for temporary storage until they are to be provided to the client terminals.

In one implementation virtualized application executables may be pushed to the thin client using a secure file transfer protocol secure shell SSH and or the like.

The projection server passes the virtualized application executables to the client terminal which receives unpackages and or runs the files to engage the applications at the client terminal including exchanges of data related to operation of those applications . The projection server may then monitor whether a logout request has been received from the client terminal and if not may wait until such a request is received . The user at the client terminal may then initiate a logout when he or she is finished with the application session precipitating a re initialization of the client terminal whereby data updates are passed over the network to one or more targets and the client terminal is returned to its pre login and or pre boot state . In one embodiment the terminal may erase e.g. securely the contents of its memory to ensure a pre boot state and enhance security for example by issuing root admin level format command on the storage mechanism e.g. hard drive. In one implementation user generated data and or other saved data may be persisted and or passed to the authentication and or data server s by the projection server and projection of application images to the client terminal ceased . In an alternative implementation the client terminal may itself communicate directly with the authentication and or data server s to provide data update information. Data updates received by the authentication and or data server s may be stored and or persisted such as in a central database .

In one implementation one or more fields of user information e.g. name and department code may be mandatory with remaining fields optional. An example of a instruction message response to user information for application access may comprise a list of application identifiers and may in one implementation take a form similar to the following XML example 

In one implementation the instruction message may further include a client terminal device identifier to direct the application files to the appropriate target.

The EREVAL system may contain a number of operational components and or data stores. A EREVAL controller may serve a central role in some embodiments of EREVAL operation serving to orchestrate the reception generation modification and distribution of data and or instructions to from and between EREVAL components and or mediate communications with external entities and systems.

In one embodiment the EREVAL controller may be housed separately from other controllers modules components and or databases within or external to the EREVAL system while in another embodiment some or all of the other modules components controllers and or databases within and or external to the EREVAL system may be housed within and or configured as part of the EREVAL controller. Further detail regarding implementations of EREVAL controller operations modules components and databases is provided below.

In the implementation illustrated in the EREVAL system may be integrated as part of an authentication control and or data server and the EREVAL controller may be configured to couple to external entities and or systems via one or more interface components. For example. the EREVAL controller may be coupled to a projection server client interface . In one implementation the projection server client interface may mediate communications to and from a remote projection server and or one or more client terminals such as to receive data requests data inputs table tracking syntax configured strings rule specifications organizational structure specification and or inputs instructions and or the like and to return data rules instructions parsed string tokens generated table tracking syntax configured strings and or the like. The EREVAL controller may further be coupled to a central database interface . In one implementation the central database interface may mediate communications to and from a remote central database to send parsed string tokens data updates rules data requests and or the like and to receive requested data rules table identifiers field identifiers column identifiers and or the like. The EREVAL controller may further be coupled to a user interface . In one implementation the user interface may mediate communications to and from a user to receive administrator inputs settings configuration inputs and or files table tracking syntax configured strings data requests data inputs updates and or the like and to send graphical user interface screens requested data generated strings and or the like. In various implementations one or more of the interface components described above may serve to configure data into application transport network media access control and or physical layer formats in accordance with a network transmission protocol such as but not limited to FTP TCP IP SMTP Short Message Peer to Peer SMPP and or the like. For example the interfaces may be configured for receipt and or transmission of data to an external and or network database. The interfaces may further be configurable to implement and or translate Wireless Application Protocol VOIP and or the like data formats and or protocols. The interfaces may further house one or more ports jacks antennas and or the like to facilitate wired and or wireless communications with and or within the EREVAL system.

In one implementation the EREVAL controller may further be coupled to a plurality of components configured to implement EREVAL functionality and or services. For example the EREVAL controller may be coupled to a Parser component which may in one implementation be configured to parse received input strings into constituent string tokens and or otherwise implement interpretation of inputs in accordance with one or more table tracking syntaxes and or descriptive business grammars. The Parser component may further be configured to parse inputs into a table tracking syntax configured input string and attendant data instructions requests and or the like e.g. a search query data input rule request and or the like accompanying a table specifying input string . The EREVAL controller may further be coupled to a Command Generator component which may in one implementation be configured to generate database manipulation commands queries data input and or storage commands and or the like such as based on tokens extracted from received input strings. For example in one implementation the Command Generator component may be configured to receive parsed string tokens such as from the Parser component and generate a SQL Select command to query data from a EREVAL database and or generate a SQL Insert Into command to enter attendant data into a EREVAL database. Implementations such as these are illustrated in further detail below. The EREVAL controller may further be coupled to a Dynamic Syntax Generator component which may in one implementation be configured to dynamically generate a syntax and or strings configured with a dynamic syntax in response to user action. For example in one implementation the Dynamic Syntax Generator may engage a graphical user interface such as may be provided to a client terminal via the Projection Server Client Interface and or the User Interface that is accessible by a user and that admits inputs indicative of an organizational structure said inputs instructing the formation and or organization of the dynamic syntax. The EREVAL controller may further be coupled to a String Generator component which may in one implementation be configured to generate strings in association with various inputs and or stored data. For example in one implementation the String Generator may be configured to generate strings based on organizational hierarchies generated by and or with the Dynamic Syntax Generator . In another implementation the String Generator may be configured to generate strings matching data queries such as may be submitted by a user to see any and or all syntax configured strings that match the data query.

In one implementation the EREVAL controller may further be coupled to one or more databases configured to store and or maintain EREVAL data. A Syntax database may contain information pertaining to string token types and or sequences delimiters string token lengths syntax identifiers dynamic syntax parameters and or the like. In some implementations the EREVAL may compare received input strings with fields and or records in the Syntax database in order to verify formatting of the input string assist in parsing the string and or the like.

In some implementations links may exist between lower level and or atomic level tables as well. For example in the illustrated implementation the Client table is linked to the Country table and to the Vertical table and the LegalEntity table is linked to the Country table . Some tables linked by foreign keys to tables shown in have been omitted from illustration for the sake of clarity.

In some implementations links may exist between lower level and or atomic level tables as well. For example in the illustrated implementation the Class table is linked to the SubClass table . Some tables linked by foreign keys to tables shown in have been omitted from illustration for the sake of clarity.

An Employee table may include fields allowing specification of records pertaining to user and or employee attributes and or characteristics and or the like. In one implementation an Employee table may include fields such as but not limited to UserID GUID UserName Email SubTitleID SubFunctionID ISOwner StartDate EndDate CreatedBy CreatedDate UpdatedBy UpdatedDate TS TitleID FK FunctionID FK DepartmentCodeID and or the like. Some tables linked by foreign keys to tables shown in have been omitted from illustration for the sake of clarity.

A string is shown at that is configured in accordance with a table tracking grammar syntax whereby delimited string tokens correlate with and or correspond to tables in the database. For example in the illustrated implementation the string comprises a series of tokes delimited by periods wherein each token admits a table identifier value corresponding to one of the indicated tables. The first token of the string at corresponds to a Client table and may in one implementation admit values for the ClientID field. The second token of the string at corresponds to a Country table bio and may in one implementation admit values for the CountryID field. The third token of the string at corresponds to a Vertical table and may in one implementation admit values for the VerticalID field. The fourth token of the string at corresponds to a BusinessType table and may in one implementation admit values for the BusinessTypeID field. In some implementations the table tracking string syntax may also include table fields other than table identifier fields. For example while the fifth token of the string at may be said to correspond to or correlate with a ClientProgram table the token itself admits values for the Description field of that table.

In various implementations of a table tracking string syntax various punctuation marks character and or the like e.g. periods commas dashes blank spaces hash marks dollar signs asterisks and or the like and or any combination or sequence thereof may be used in different combinations and arrangements to delimit string tokens. For example in one implementation periods may be placed between pairs of string tokens e.g. the period between the client and country tokens in the string at . In one implementation every pair of string tokens is separated by delimiting punctuation such as a period. In another implementation one or more pairs of tokens may have alternative punctuation and or characters delimiting them than other token pairs and or may have no delimiting punctuation and or characters whatsoever. For example the country token and vertical token in the string at are not delimited by any additional characters or punctuation. In one implementation a string interpreting component may have a pre set token length stored for a given table tracking syntax and may parse the string based for example on the number of characters at a certain point in the string following a particular delimiter and or the like.

In some implementations the table tracking syntax may comprise a descriptive business grammar having string tokens that correspond to table fields determined and or expected to have strong descriptive correlation with business properties and or behaviors. For example the implementation of a program code string syntax shown in has string tokens corresponding to a client name country vertical e.g. industry company position in a supply chain and or the like business type e.g. nature of services provided to a client and a client program description. Any of a wide variety of other tables and or table fields may be correlated with string tokens in other implementations of descriptive business grammars. In one implementation tables and or table fields comprising a string syntax in a descriptive business grammar may be selected by a EREVAL administrator. In an alternative implementation tables and or table fields having strong descriptive correlation with business properties and or behaviors may be determined systematically by selecting one or more business properties and or behaviors of interest e.g. size revenue common business rules and or the like and performing a discriminant analysis classification and or regression tree analysis and or the like statistical analysis to select a subset of tables and or table fields from a larger set the subset having maximal correlation with the business properties and or behaviors of interest.

In one implementation a table tracking string syntax may take a form that is static and pre set such that the number arrangement selection and or the like of string tokens is fixed and or substantially the same for each instance of a string formed in accordance with the syntax. In another implementation a table tracking string syntax may be formed dynamically such as based on user inputs and different strings formed in accordance with the syntax may appear different have a different number selection arrangement and or the like of tokens and or the like. For example hierarchical properties of a system e.g. departments of an organization may be indexed with a dynamic table tracking string syntax having a selection and or number of tokens representing a position of a given property within the hierarchy. shows a schematic illustration of correlations between positions within an organizational hierarchy and corresponding strings configured with a dynamic hierarchical table tracking syntax in one embodiment of EREVAL operation. The organizational hierarchy is configured as a tree depicting departments within an organization with each node of the tree representing a descriptor or characteristic of a corresponding department division and or the like. In turn each displayed characteristic may correspond to a table table identifier table field and or the like in a database. The root node corresponds to the organization depicted XYZ Corp. and may represent a table field and or table identifier for for example a EntityID EntityName ClientID ClientName and or the like. Also depicted in the figure are a series of so called Department Codes comprising dynamic hierarchical table tracking syntax configured strings correlated with nodes in the organizational hierarchy wherein each token in the string corresponds to and or correlates with one of the descriptors and or characteristics of the organizational department represented at a given node of the organizational hierarchy tree . In one implementation a department code configured with a dynamic hierarchical table tracking syntax may include any and or a particular class of logical arrangements of descriptors including but not limited to function sub function country location vertical business type client team and or the like.

For example the root node depicting the identity of the organization XYZ Corp. has a corresponding department code of XYZ . A sub node emanating from the root note such as the Analytics department shown at may then have a corresponding department code with a root token as in but with the addition of a new token ANA delimited from the root token to yield XYZ.ANA . The addition of further levels of hierarchy may add further tokens to the string syntax. Depending on the hierarchical arrangement of organizational descriptors in the organizational tree different department codes may be generated having tokens in similar positions in the strings which nevertheless correspond to different types of descriptors different tables different table identifiers and or the like. For example in the illustrated implementation the department code at XYZ.MAR.US.LA has a concluding token LA indicating a location of the department i.e. in Los Angeles . On the other hand the department code at XYZ.OPS.CA.A has a concluding token A that is also in the fourth position of the string but here indicates a team affiliation i.e. Team A . In one implementation the EREVAL may parse a dynamic hierarchical table tracking syntax configured string in a hierarchical manner proceeding from a root token which may in some implementations always correspond to a particular table table identifier table field and or the like and then progressively comparing subsequent string tokens to table fields and or linked tables until matches are found permitting identification of the tables table identifiers table fields and or the like to which the string tokens correspond. As such the number of delimiters may indicate the relative hierarchical position of a value but the tokens within the delimiters may represent the types of categorization this has the very powerful advantage allowing for orthogonal constructs of disparate data types within the grammar without excess duplication of descriptors and greater number of descriptive permutations for example it allows for the decoupling of business categories of information from accounting categories while allowing permutations therebetween.

In one embodiment the EREVAL may include a user interface facility similar in appearance to the schematic illustration shown in permitting a graphical generation of a hierarchical organizational chart and corresponding dynamic hierarchical table tracking syntax configured strings such as the department codes shown at see illustrating an example UI screenshot . For example such a user interface may include a plurality of organizational descriptors such as function sub function country location vertical business type client team and or the like that are configured as selectable interface elements. The organizational chart may then be generated by selecting the descriptors for association with different positions in the chart causing new nodes to be created from those positions. In one implementation each descriptor may be dragged and dropped from a bank of descriptors to a position on or near the chart causing that descriptor to become a new node extending by a branch from the nearest node above it in the hierarchy. The EREVAL may also automatically generate a new department code corresponding to the new node by appending a token corresponding to the new node to the string corresponding to the next highest node in the chart from the new node.

If sufficient indicia do not exist to distinguish the type of string and or syntax corresponding to an input string the EREVAL may undertake an error handling process request user specification of the string type perform additional analysis on the input string to discern the type and or the like . If sufficient indicia are present at the EREVAL may determine which string type and or string syntax is associated with the input string such as based on that indicia . In one implementation the EREVAL may distinguish between a string configured in accordance with a static table tracking index and with a dynamic table tracking index. In the illustrated implementation a static table tracking syntax configured input string may then be subjected to a static table tracking syntax parsing and a dynamic table tracking syntax configured input string may be subjected to a dynamic table tracking syntax parsing .

If the EREVAL determines at that the next segment in the string is not an undelimited multi token segment then the EREVAL may extract the whole segment as a string token and store the extracted string token such as in a database in random access memory and or the like.

A determination may be made as to whether there exists a delimiter past the token or tokens previously extracted . If there is an additional delimiter the EREVAL may drop the delimiter from the string and move to evaluate the next string segment . In an implementation where there is no trailing delimiter at the end of a string in a table tracking syntax determining that there are no delimiters at may cause the EREVAL to conclude parsing the input string and or to provide extracted string tokens to a target such as an end user target application database table and or record display device report and or the like.

A determination may then be made as to whether there exists a delimiter after the first extracted token . If not such as in the case of a single token string configuration then the ADE s parsing of the dynamic table tracking syntax string may be concluded and or the extracted string token provided to a target . If a delimiter is found at the EREVAL may drop the delimiter from the input string and move to the next segment of the string . The next string token may be extracted and compared with data fields and or records of a table associated with the previously extracted token to determine a next token type . A determination may be made as to whether a match to the token has been found and if not then an error handling procedure may be undertaken such as providing an error message to the user requesting reentry of the input string checking common typographical or spelling errors and or the like. If on the other hand a match is found to the next token the determined token type may be noted and stored in association with the extracted token before returning to to check for a next delimiter in the string sequence.

In one embodiment department codes may be parsed based on token positions relative to delimiting characters and as such provide the parsed values for use in SQL commands. For example a rule may specify that all department codes having a particular token after the nth delimiting character are authorized to access a particular set of application files. A parsing routine may then count n delimiters and compare the immediately following token to the rule token to determine if the rule is applicable e.g. whether a user associated with the department code is authorized to access the set of application files .

A determination may be made as to whether sufficient query specifiers have been supplied to conduct a database query . If not then an error handling procedure may be undertaken an error message returned additional information may be requested from a user and or the like . If sufficient query specifiers have been supplied the EREVAL may resolve a table name and or a column name based on the query specifiers . For example in one implementation the query specifiers themselves may comprise a table name and or a column name. The EREVAL may also parse the input string into one or more string tokens . The query statement may then be formed as a combination of parsed string tokens and resolved table name and or column name and said statement used to query the database . A determination may be made as to whether one or more results are returned in response to the query . If not then an error handling procedure may be undertaken an error message returned reentry of query parameters requested and or the like . Otherwise if a result is obtained by the query the result may be provided to a target such as to the requesting system to a third party user application system and or the like .

In some implementations the universal data library may be communicatively coupled with an automated data extractor configured to receive specification of report templates and or to generate reports of values associated with universal variables. Report generation schedules triggering conditions and or the like may likewise be specified as part of report template definition and values included in the report may be draw in real time and or on a scheduled periodic or triggered basis via the universal data librarian from multiple otherwise disparate databases and or data sources.

In some implementations the universal data library may further be communicatively coupled with a global data exchanger configured to communicate with one or more internal or external databases and or data sources to exchange data therewith. For example the EREVAL may be coupled to one or more external data servers and or external databases to receive data files therefrom and or provide data files thereto. In one implementation the EREVAL may be configured to retrieve one or more data files from an external data source such as on a scheduled periodic triggered and or the like basis parse discrete data units from the file contents wherein the parsing may depend on whether the file is fixed length delimited XML format and or the like and associate the parsed data units with universal variables in accordance with a pre defined specification. In some implementations the EREVAL may further be configured to mediate exchanges of data between internal databases. For example the EREVAL may be configured to draw data from a source database such as on a scheduled periodic triggered and or the like basis and to associate the drawn data with universal variables in accordance with a pre defined specification. In both cases association of sourced data with universal variables may cause the sourced data to be input in one or more internal databases based on associations between database tables and or fields and universal variables as defined within the universal data librarian.

In one implementation the universal data librarian global data exchanger and or EREVAL may be configured to reformat data such as to place it in a condition of conformity with like data in a target database. For example sourced date data may be in a MM DD YY format while target date data is stored in a DD MM YYYY format. One or more of the described systems may be configured to reformat data as needed or desired in accordance with a pre defined specification. In one implementation the universal data librarian automated data extractor and or EREVAL may be configured to combine data from one or more sources such as by appending arithmetic operation and or the like into a single data value provided to a data target.

A schematic illustration of EREVAL operation in one example is provided in . Here two application databases and each attended by a respective application server and each have tables and containing fields related to a first name labeled Firstname in table and Name.First in . Each database is communicatively coupled to a universal data library which includes records specifying relationships between the fields in application databases and universal variables. In the illustrated example a record specifies a relationship between the Firstname field in the application database and the universal variable First Name. Similarly a record specifies a relationship between the Name.First field in the application database and the universal variable First Name. The universal variable First Name and or values thereof may then be provided to a user interface third party application external data target report generator and or the like . Though omitted for clarity details pertaining to the location of fields in an application database such as table names foreign keys and or the like may also be included in universal data library records to facilitate location of desired data.

The interface may further allow for specification of a function reformatting and or the like to be applied to data associated with one or more universal variables . For example in the illustrated implementation the CandidateName universal variable field is set as a concatenation of a firstname variable and a lastname variable. The interface may further allow for specification of one or more databases applications and or the like with which a universal variable is to be associated . In one implementation by specifying an application in connection with a particular universal variable a facility may be made available for a user to further specify a particular table and or field within a database associated with that application to which the universal variable should be connected and or mapped. Such further specification is described in further detail below. The interface may further admit specification of particular values for universal variables such as a fixed value for particular variables and or sets of restricted values to which future inputs and or associations must be matched e.g. a list of 50 state abbreviations to which any state input to a corresponding universal variable must conform .

An example implementation of hierarchically arranged universal variables is provided in Appendix A for one embodiment of EREVAL operation. Each universal variable includes family and subfamily designation and is further characterized by a field name. Variable families may specify high level categories to which particular universal variables belong and or are associated. In the implementation illustrated in Appendix A the families include Consumer Account Payment Letter Call Product Consumer Credit Candidate Employee Plans Forms Supplier Program Employee Government Investor Entity and or the like. Subfamilies may provide further detail as to the nature of the particular universal variable and the field name provides yet further detail to unambiguously designate the type of data to be associated with that universal variables. Universal variables such as may be organized hierarchically with families subfamilies field names and or the like may be selected in some implementations to maximize the extent to which the variables can be mapped to and or otherwise associated with enterprise and or third party data and or database tables and or table fields. For example in one implementation universal variables may comprise business objects wherein the selection naming and organization of the universal variables is designed to facilitate understanding of the variables in a business context and or by those skilled in business who may otherwise have little or no knowledge of database design or management. By mapping table fields from the underlying databases to such business object universal variables the EREVAL may facilitate manipulation of the data relevant to business managers without the need for assistance from database administrators and or any other database manipulation experts. The selection of universal variables illustrated in Appendix A will hereinafter be referred to as a business descriptive set of universal variables.

In an alternative implementation a universal variable hierarchy may follow a business grammar construct where each segment of the hierarchy follows a business grammar segment or token type e.g. client name followed by country followed by vertical followed by business type followed by client program in an implementation wherein the hierarchy follows a program code grammar .

In another embodiment the hierarchy may itself be stored in the EREVAL database e.g. where an object oriented database may be used to establish entity relationships between a superclass entity and its constituent subclasses and its eventual field entries. In one embodiment each of the XML and or data entries may be read into the user interface table column headings. Thus when a user creates and or edits values in the user interface appropriate records and or XML entries are pushed into the hierarchy data structure.

In one embodiment the universal data librarian and or other components described herein may connect to internal and or external databases by means of one or more database adapters such as but not limited to ODBC JDBC ADO.NET OLEDB and or the like.

If at least one database for the request cannot be identified an error handling procedure may be undertaken such as providing an error message to the user requesting specificity as to the application and or database to which the request is directed and or the like. Otherwise a universal data library query may be generated based on the specified one or more universal variables and the specified and or discerned application and or database.

In one implementation business grammar tokens may be connected to and or otherwise associated with particular universal variables which in turn may be linked to table fields in local and or remote databases. A query or other database transaction leveraging a business grammar string may then be employed to access and or transact data with table fields in either local or remote databases using universal variables as intermediaries in construction of for example SQL commands. This query may be submitted to the universal data librarian to determine one or more table fields in the specified database and or a database associated with the specified application to which the specified universal variable corresponds. A determination may be made as to whether the associated field exists in the target database whether the field has some data values stored in association with it and or the like and if not another error handling procedure may be undertaken such as providing an error message to the user. In one implementation determination of whether an associated field exists may be accomplished by evaluating a database management system response to a query submission e.g. whether the desired data is retrieved or whether an error message is returned from the database management system . Otherwise a database command may be generated for the target database based on the identified one or more fields and the original user request . The database command may in various implementations and or uses comprise a query an input a data transfer a data reformatting an update and or the like. The generated command may then be submitted to the target database to effect the desired transaction .

Once the external values are associated with universal variables the values may be stored in an appropriate database provided to a local application and or the like .

In some implementations the reverse procedure may also be implemented by the EREVAL whereby data values stored in a local database and associated with universal variables are provided as values for external variables and configured as an output file for provision to an external data server and or external database . In some implementations the output file may be configured as a report which may be provided for viewing on a display device for printing and or the like. In some implementations the formatting instructions may be reversible and applied to either external variable values or reversibly to universal variable values.

The data exchange illustrated in is similar to that shown in except that instead of reformatting a single external variable and or universal variable value the EREVAL may apply a function to combine values associated with more than one of the variables to yield the appropriate associations. For example the function may specify that Universal Variable 1 is equal to External Variable 1 while Universal Variable 2 is equal to a sum of External Variable 1 and External Variable 2. This example function is reversible since External Variable 1 and External Variable 2 could be recovered from Universal Variable 1 and Universal Variable 2 i.e. External Variable 1 Universal Variable 1 and External Variable 2 Universal Variable 2 Universal Variable 1 . Any mathematical operation calculation computation data manipulation reformatting and or the like may be applied to data by the EREVAL as desired in various implementations or embodiments of EREVAL operation.

In some implementations the EREVAL in may be provided at the local side with a limited subset of universal variable inputs a file containing universal variable inputs and or pointers to universal variables and or the like. This may allow for isolation of data received from an external source and or generation of universal variable collections for particular functions or implementations of EREVAL embodiments. For example in one implementation a universal payment file may be generated locally containing a set of universal variables that are expected to be relevant to any bank payment transaction. The EREVAL may then have particular mappings set up for particular banks whereby each mapping selects a subset of universal variables from the universal payment file that is relevant to and or desired by the particular bank to which payment information is being provided. For example a domestic wire transaction in the U.S. may only use a routing number and account number while an international wire may instead or in addition require a Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Transaction SWIFT code intermediary bank information and account number and or the like.

In another example a user may specify a periodic schedule e.g. a specified time of each day at which the EREVAL is to pull a file from or push a file to an external data target. In another example a user may specify a triggering condition e.g. a data update a user request or other user action occurrence of an automated part of a process and or the like the occurrence of which triggers a EREVAL mediated data exchange between the universal variables and the target. The scheduled and or triggered data exchange may also apply to data exchanges between local databases mapped to universal variables. For example a user may specify that at a specified time every day particular fields in local database corresponding to the universal variables should be updated with data in fields in local database associated with those same universal variables. In some implementations a user may specify a time variable and or trigger variable frequency of effectuating transactions. For example if a new external source has just been added and the data from that source is expected to be updated frequently in an initial period the transaction schedule for that source may be set to a twice daily frequency for the first week followed by a once daily update for the following two weeks and a weekly update thereafter. Transaction frequencies may also be automatically varied based on the detected occurrence of specified triggers. For example the EREVAL may monitor a stock market index such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and may be configured to increase transaction frequencies related to market data when a slope of the monitored index exceeds a specified threshold and to decrease the transaction frequency when the slope of the monitored index drops back below the specified threshold.

The interface may further provide a listing of selectable universal variables for association such as via a drag and drop interface mechanism with parsed components of an external data file such as may be received from an external source or may be destined for transmission to an external target . An example of such a listing of selectable universal variables is shown at in . In one implementation a universal variable may be dragged and dropped to an association area of the interface wherein the universal variable may be mapped to and or otherwise associated with a specified portion of the external file. For example in one implementation the external file may be configured as a fixed length file and one or more universal variables may be associated with one or more portions of the fixed length file as specified by the position of the data within that file. In another implementation the external file may be configured as a delimited file and one or more universal variables may be associated with one or more portions of the delimited file as specified by how the data is delimited within the file. In another implementation the external file may be configured as an XML file and one or more universal variables may be associated with one or more portions of the XML file as specified by the XML tags setting off data within the file.

An implementation of an XML data exchange specification resulting from inputs to interfaces such as those shown in examples of may take a form similar to the following example 

Other file configurations and parsing specifiers may be employed within various implementations of EREVAL embodiments.

In one implementation the EREVAL may perform an initial check of the file to ensure that it does not have any clear problems or errors. For example the EREVAL may check that the file has at least a minimum file size e.g. not a null file is configured in accordance with an expected format does not exhibit any characteristics of a virus or other undesired file and or the like. If errors or other problems are detected an error handling procedure may be undertaken such as providing an error message to a specified recipient e.g. an administrator of the data source attempting to repair the file attempting to extract any salvageable data from the file and or the like. A determination may be made as to whether there is any retrievable data in the file such as following an attempted repair at and if not then the process may conclude . Otherwise if data can be retrieved from the file the EREVAL may query a parse instruction from a mapping record associated with the transaction . The parsing instruction may for example specify a position of data in the file for a fixed length file a number of delimiters setting off data in the file for a delimited file an XML tag setting off the data in an XML file and or the like. Based on the parsing instruction the EREVAL may parse data from the file . A determination may then be made as to whether any reformatting of the data is needed or desired such as may be specified in the mapping record. For example the convention for formatting of dates may be different in the file than for the universal variable to which the date is to be connected so a conversion of format may be desired before associating the file data with the universal variable and or table fields connected thereto in local databases. If conversion is desired then a conversion instruction may be queried from the mapping record and the particular data converted and or reformatted in accordance with that instruction . The EREVAL may then query a data location associated with the mapping to which the data from the file is to be provided such as may be directed by a universal variable specified in the mapping record. For example the data location may be a field in a table in a database mapped to the universal variable to which the data from the file is connected. The data parsed from the file may then be stored at the data location and a determination made as to whether there is any further data in the file to be extracted . If so information associated with the next data element may be queried from the mapping record associated with the transaction and the EREVAL may return to to parse that next data from the file. Otherwise the transaction may be concluded .

If there are not multiple columns or if there are multiple columns but no fixed relationship therebetween the EREVAL may generate input statements such as SQL Input statements with the input data which may in some implementations be arranged in multiple independent columns and the corresponding table field locations to save the data from the file at those locations . In some implementations a SQL statement generated as described above may take a form similar to the following example 

If on the other hand the EREVAL determines that there are multiple columns with a fixed relationship between them at then it may seek to discern relationships between table field locations to which the columns in the file correspond . For example the file may include a column for customer name which is connected to a universal variable CustomerName and a column for customer account which is connected to a universal variable CustomerAccount. Each universal variable is in turn mapped to table fields within one or more databases such as a customer name field and a customer account field. In order to build a command to port the file data to those fields the EREVAL may seek to determine the relationship between the customer name field and the customer account field. If these fields are in the same table in the same database a direct Input statement may be employed. However if for example the fields exist in different tables within a database the Input statement may be supplemented with a Join clause such as a SQL Join clause to reflect the connection between the tables and the data provided thereto. By inputting the data with the Join clause the connection between the customer name information and the customer account information will be preserved for future access. Further detail as to how the relationship between table fields is determined is provided below. Once the relationship is established the EREVAL may generate an Input statement with the file data the table field locations and any necessary or desired Join clauses and may store the data with the generated statement .

Another implementation of a report parameter specification interface is shown at in with report parameter fields filled. displays an example of a report generated by the inputs shown in . The report is configured as a spreadsheet file and includes columns corresponding to extracted data such as call account number call user name call phone number call result extended result which may in one implementation include additional information to refine the call result information call date and or time and or the like.

In one implementation Silverlight code general Silverlight language libraries and or the like may be used to generate the tables and column presentation in HTML format. The tables may be comprised of text fields and appropriate calls to the libraries may be made to pass information via drag and drop.

In various implementations a report may be generated for output as a physical document e.g. a printout an electronic document a structured data file e.g. fixed length delimited XML and or the like one or more database records a user interface display and or the like.

A determination may be made as to whether any of the retrieved data is to be reformatted modified functionally combined with one or more other data values and or the like prior to inclusion in the report . If so the reformatting instructions may be retrieved such as by querying them from a report generation template record and those instructions may then be applied to one or more selected universal variables and or universal variable values . In one implementation a set of data layout and or configuration instructions may also be retrieved such as from a report specification template record. Data layout and or configuration instructions may for example include specifications of the arrangement and or order of data font text size text color and or other typographical characteristics of the data titles headers borders margins table formats charts graphics and or the like for inclusion with the data and or the like. The retrieved data may then be configured in accordance with the retrieved layout and or configuration instructions .

A report target may then be queried such as from a report generation template record. A report target may in various implementations be selected from any of a wide variety of different possibilities such as a display interface a printer a local or remote database and or data server an electronic file and or document format e.g. portable document format spreadsheet word processing document and or the like and or the like. The configured report may then be provided to the target . In some implementations a schedule triggering condition and or the like may monitored to determine when the report should be provided to the target. In one implementation the schedule triggering condition and or the like for provision of a report to a target may be separate and distinct from a schedule triggering condition and or the like for report generation and or data querying for inclusion in a report.

In some implementations the EREVAL may be integrated as part of the system architecture illustrated in and may interact with any or all of the other system components described with reference thereto. For example in one implementation the EREVAL may be provided at the authentication control server and or at the data server to mediate interactions with data stored in one or more central databases . Mediated interactions may include interactions with external and or third party data sources or targets projection servers thin clients and or other network terminal devices and or the like.

In some embodiments the EREVAL may facilitate the dissemination of information related to new hires employee promotions demotions terminations and or the like employee status changes and or updates throughout the various data systems and or departments of an enterprise. For example the EREVAL may be configured to automatically update selected table fields in various enterprise databases as needed to incorporate information regarding employee status updates. The EREVAL may further be configured to automatically generate reports letters forms manuals instructions requisitions notifications requests inventories invoices and or the like documents based on employee information in response to changes in employee status. In some implementations the EREVAL may also be configured to receive employee referrals of prospective job candidates to track candidate progress and or to administer and or instruct the provision of referral rewards to eligible referrers based on the hiring of referred candidates.

Once the trigger has been detected the system may query employee information associated with and or connected to employee status updates . For example in one implementation employee information such as employee status update information may be queried based on an employee identifier or other information contained in and or linked to the employee status update trigger. In another implementation the system may query all employee information a subset of employee information and or employee information meeting some specified criteria e.g. employee information that has a status update timestamp later than a benchmark time . The system may then proceed to take one or more actions related to the employee status update such as updating other databases with the new employee status information generating reports related to the new employee status and or the like. To that end the system may select one or more global data exchange maps automated data extractor templates and or the like. A determination may be made as to whether selection of maps templates and or the like should be rule based . If so then one or more rules may be queried such as based on employee information the employee status update trigger and or the like and the retrieved one or more rules may then be applied to select global data exchange maps automated data extractor templates and or the like . An example of such a rule may be a rule specifying that for all employee title changes caught by a scheduled system review at the end of each workday a report template is selected for generating reports to department heads for those employees confirming the updating of the employee title. In another example a rule may specify that any employee status update recognized as a new hire of a candidate should cause selection of a global data exchange map for transferring candidate data to corresponding employee data.

If rule based selection of maps and or templates is not desired at then the system may select maps and or templates independent of any rules . For example a global data exchange map may exist to harmonize employee title data across several databases on a scheduled basis regardless of what the title change is who the employee is or other factors. Once maps and or templates have been selected the system may updated database data and or generate reports therewith .

In one implementation maps and or templates may be selected after and or in response to occurrence of an employee status update trigger. In another implementation maps and or templates may be selected before occurrence of an employee status update trigger and the application of those maps and or triggers may occur after and or in response to occurrence of the employee status update trigger.

In one implementation some or all candidate information may be provided by a referrer such as by a current employee. In such a referral situation a referrer identifier may also be included in association with the received candidate information.

Candidate information may then be stored in table fields linked to the universal variables to which the candidate information has been associated . A determination may then be made as to whether the candidate has been hired . Such a determination may be made in a variety of different ways within different implementations. For example the determination may be made based upon the receipt of a hiring indicator see such as may be generated by the selection of a Hired or Offer button and or the like by a hiring administrator in association with a candidate identifier in a user interface see e.g. . Alternatively the determination may be made by checking such as on a scheduled and or periodic basis a database entry corresponding to a hire date for that particular candidate all candidates a subset of candidates and or the like. If no indication of hiring is discerned the system may wait for a period of time before checking again receiving a hiring indicator and or the like. If a hire has occurred a hiring indicator may be received such as a Boolean variable value indicating a hire a variable indicating a recent hire date and or the like and stored . The system may then select one or more global data exchange maps and or automated data extractor templates such as may or may not be based on one or more selected rules as in .

The selected maps and or templates may then be applied to update databases and or generate reports with employee data as needed or desired in response to the hiring . In one implementation maps may be selected and applied to notify various enterprise departments and or to update their corresponding databases of the new hire and or to generate reports instructions requests and or the like for equipment services and or the like to accommodate the new employee. For example departments such as information technology legal marketing benefits payroll accounting human resources facilities an employee s specific department of employment and or the like may have corresponding maps to port all or some subset of candidate data to their own databases upon the hiring of the candidate. In another example one or more such departments may have established report templates to generate letters requisitions instructions manuals reports forms and or the like based on candidate data upon hiring of the candidate. Further details of such examples are provided with reference to the figures below.

A determination may be made as to whether updating of a database in accordance with the application of a selected map at itself triggers the selection of additional maps and or templates see . If so the system may return to to select the additional maps and or templates. Otherwise the flow may conclude .

A departmental map may also select a subset of employee data as departmental data for inclusion in a departmental database . In one implementation a departmental map may be chosen and or queried based on a department code associated with the candidate information and or the department for which the candidate has been hired. In general other maps templates and or the like may be selected queried and or applied based on one or more tokens contained in a descriptive business grammar and or table tracking syntax configured string.

The interface in may include some columns indicative of a candidate s performance on one or more evaluations tests interviews and or the like. In one implementation the interface in may further be applicable for current employees who are candidates for new positions promotions and or the like such as may require additional training passing a test and or the like. A status column may include information reflecting performance on a test performance in an interview performance during and or successful completion of a training program generation of a job offer and or rejection hiring onboarding and or the like. A test date column may include information reflecting a date and or time of a test taken related to a job for which the candidate has applied. A start date column may include information reflecting a proposed or expected employment start date. A location column may include information reflecting a location of and or associated with a prospective job such as an office location. Last name and first name columns may include information reflecting a candidate s name and or other identifying information. An email column may include information reflecting a candidate email address or other contact information. First party and third party columns may include information reflecting a performance score and or the like on particular tests interviews and or the like taken by the candidate. A background column may include interface elements allowing a user to enter information such as may pertain to performance of a candidate on a test in an interview completion of a training program and or the like. An interview column may include one or more interface elements allowing entry of notes scores ratings and or the like related to performance of a candidate on a test in an interview during a training program and or the like. An action column may include interface elements allowing entry of a candidate status with regard to a job offer interview performance test performance training program performance and or the like. For example in one implementation the interface elements may allow an administrator to reject a candidate with respect to a particular job offer promotion title change and or the like and or to offer the same to the candidate. In another implementation the interface elements may allow an administrator to register a user s performance status with respect to a training program test and or the like such as whether the user has passed or failed attained a certification and or the like. Selection of interface elements such as those shown at may trigger the updating of candidate and or employee data in one or more databases such as may be related to a job title employment status certification status training status and or the like and in one implementation may further trigger selection and or application of one or more global data exchanger maps and or automated data extractor templates for updating of one or more additional databases and or the generation of one or more reports based on changes to employee status.

In addition to managing database updates and or report generation associated with hiring and or onboarding of job candidates the EREVAL system may be configured to manage database updates and or generate reports associated with status updates of existing employees such as promotions demotions transfers training certifications and or the like. shows an implementation of logic flow for employee status update management in one embodiment of EREVAL operation. The system may monitor employee status update trigger conditions to determine if a status update trigger has occurred . Examples of triggers may include the occurrence of a prescheduled and or periodically recurring trigger time the receipt of an administrator request the detection of an update occurring in particular tables and or fields of one or more monitored databases and or the like. If no trigger is detected the system may wait for a period of time and or continue to monitor trigger conditions . Once a trigger is detected status update information such as the nature of a title change may be received and stored . A determination may then be made as to whether additional database updates and or reports are warranted needed desired and or the like . Such a determination may for example be based on the application of one or more map and or template selection rules to employee information employee status update trigger information and or the like. If no updates or reports are needed the flow may conclude and or may return to to continue monitoring employee status update trigger conditions. Database updates and or report generation may not be needed for example when an employee status update reflects a minor change in an employee position and or a change that does not require notification of other departments within an enterprise. Otherwise one or more global data exchange maps and or automated data extractor templates may be selected and applied to update database fields and or generate reports based on employee information. A determination may be made as to whether the updating of one or more databases at triggers the selection and or application of further global data exchanger maps and or automated data extractor templates . If so the system may return to to select additional maps and or templates as needed. Otherwise the flow may conclude and or return to to continue monitoring employee status update trigger conditions.

An interface similar to the example shown in may be employed n some implementations to display manage manipulate organize and or the like automated data extractor templates and or template generated reports associated with employee terminations. A date column may include information reflecting a date of termination a date at which a particular template was generated or last updated a date at which a particular report was generated or last updated and or the like. An entity column may include information reflecting the name and or other identifiers relating to a legal entity employer and or the like associated with an employee s former employment a particular termination report template a particular termination report and or the like. A type column may include information reflecting a type of template and or associated report e.g. an offer letter a change of employee status report interview notes a termination latter and or the like . A display window such as that shown at may provide a display of selected reports templates and or the like.

A determination may then be made as to whether the candidate has been hired . Such a determination may be made for example by querying e.g. on a scheduled and or periodic basis a Boolean variable hiring date time and or the like stored in and or in association with a candidate record and or that is accessible by and or linked to one or more universal variables. In some implementations a referral reward may be made available to a referrer if an offer is made to a candidate even if the candidate does not accept the offer and the system may check only that an offer was extended to the candidate. In other implementations in addition to being hired a candidate may have to be employed for a period of time before a referrer is eligible for a referral reward and the system may check a hire date stored in an employee record associated with the candidate against a current date to determine if sufficient time has passed. In some implementations various referral rewards may be available at various stages of a candidate s employment such as an initial bonus upon hiring of the candidate and a subsequent bonus after the candidate has worked with the company for one year. Any of a wide variety of different referral reward schedules schemes and or the like may be implemented by the EREVAL system in various embodiments.

If the candidate has not been hired a determination may be made as to whether the candidate has been denied the position for which he or she has applied . Such a determination may be made for example by querying a Boolean variable reflecting an offer denial a denial date time and or the like stored in and or in association with a candidate record. If the candidate has been denied a job offer then in one implementation candidate information and or referral information may be deleted . In another implementation candidate information may be retained even after an offer denial such as when a candidate is determined to be eligible and or qualified for future possible job offers. Referral information may also be retained in some implementations if a referrer may still qualify for a referral reward despite an initial candidate offer denial. A determination of such qualification and or eligibility may be made by an administrator and or automatically on the basis of one or more rules set based on enterprise goals needs and or desires. If the candidate s offer has not been denied at the system may wait for a period of time and continue to monitor the hiring status of the candidate . In one implementation a determination may be made as to whether the amount of time that has passed after submission of the referral notice without any hiring of the candidate exceeds a threshold limit beyond which the referrer is no longer eligible for the referral reward. In such a circumstance the system may modify and or delete one or more records of the referral to indicate the ineligibility of the referrer for the reward even if the candidate is hired.

If the system determines that the candidate has been hired at it may check a candidate record and or other records linked thereto to find information reflecting a qualified referral such as the identity of a referrer. In some implementations one or more referral rules may be applied to candidate information and or information associated therewith to determine whether a qualified referral exists. For example a rule may check a referral date to determine whether the amount of time that has passed between the referral notice and the hiring of the candidate is less than a threshold limit. In another example a rule may query the title of the job for which the candidate is being hired and compare it to a table of referral rewards to determine an appropriate reward to provide to the referrer e.g. a higher reward for a candidate hired as an executive than for a candidate hired as an entry level agent . In still another example a rule may generate a request for administrator approval of a particular referral reward and may refrain from authorizing and or instructing provision of the reward until receipt of some indicator of that administrator approval. In some implementations a rule seeking administrator approval may first query a job title associated with the referrer e.g. queried based on the referrer identifier and only seek administrator approval if the retrieved job title is one of a group of job titles associated with an administrator approval requirement. In yet another example a rule may query a referrer record to find a number of prior referral rewards received and may determine eligibility for further referral rewards based at least in part thereon. For example in one implementation a referrer may be limited to a fixed number of referral rewards in a given time period and such a rule may enforce that limit by denying a referral reward to a referrer who has already received the limiting number of rewards. In yet another example a rule may query a referrer location e.g. the country in which the referrer s office is located and compare said location to a series of locations in a lookup table in order to determine an appropriate referral reward amount for that referrer at that location. In yet another example a rule may query a department code program code and or any other descriptive business grammar and or table tracking syntax configured string associated with the candidate and or the referrer and compare the string with other strings in a lookup table to determine a referral reward appropriate for and or associated with that string for provision to the referrer.

In some implementations multi tiered rules may be applied whereby the outcome of a first rule may determine the selection and or application of subsequent rules for determining referral reward qualification. As an example a first rule may query a candidate job title to determine which of a series of referral reward schedules is applicable to a given candidate hiring and a second rule may be applied based on the selected referral reward schedule to determine if sufficient time has passed after the hiring in order for the referrer to qualify for the reward.

A determination may be made as to whether qualifying referrer information has been found in association with the candidate record and if not then the flow may conclude and or proceed to select global data exchange maps automated data extractor templates and or the like as needed . If qualified referrer data is found then a determination may be made as to whether one or more rules should be applied . Such a determination may be made for example based on an administrator setting based on the nature of the referral referrer identifier candidate identifier candidate job title and or any of a wide variety of other criteria. If a rule is to be applied the rule may be queried such as based on referrer and or candidate parameters such as a referrer identifier referrer job title candidate identifier candidate job title and or the like . The queried rule is retrieved and applied to determine whether to grant the referral reward and or how much of a referral reward to provide . In one implementation rules such as those described above with reference to boxes and may be applied at . In one implementation rules may be specified generated indexed and or otherwise defined based on and or using one or more universal variables. A determination may be made as to whether or not a grant of a referral reward is warranted and if not then the flow may conclude . If a referral reward is warranted then the system may pull and or query one or more global data exchanger maps and or automated data extractor templates and apply them to initiate and or otherwise effectuate the reward payment process . For example in one implementation the system may pull an automated data extractor template for a reward requisition form that is auto populated with candidate and or referrer information to request that the reward be paid to the referrer. Such a requisition may be provided for example to a payroll administrator for final approval and or payment of the reward. In another example a global data exchanger map may automatically pass candidate and or referrer information to a payroll database to initiate a process for payment of a referral reward to the referrer. In yet another example in addition to a referrer identity a global data exchanger map may draw referrer title information benefits information and or the like and provide it to a payroll database for inspection in determining whether when and how much of a referral reward to provide to the referrer.

In some embodiments the employment status management and or referral reward administration systems and facilities may be implemented at an authentication and or data server such as may be located at a central office and or at a projection server and or other systems located at one or more local offices.

In some embodiments the EREVAL may allow for a purse based benefits administration system rule based reimbursement facilitation and or the like. For example in one embodiment an administrator may engage EREVAL facilities to specify employee purse amounts which employees may spend on various employment benefits such as health benefits vacation packages reimbursement plans life and or disability insurance plans savings plans discount programs and or the like. Purse amounts may in one embodiment be based on and or linked with various employee characteristics such as title and or position company location department code program code other descriptive business grammar and or table tracking syntax configured string tokens and or the like. A EREVAL administrator may also be able to specify rules for allocation of purse funds to various benefits. For example rules may be set such as may be specific to particular user characteristics specifying required minimum and or maximum allocations to particular benefits required benefits user restrictions and or the like. In one embodiment the EREVAL may further facilitate the processing and provision of reimbursement payments to employees which in one implementation may be tied to benefits selected via purse based benefits selection procedures. Employees may submit reimbursement requests such as by sending an appropriately formatted email to their own email address or another specified email address and the EREVAL may process the request to extract information therefrom and determine if the reimbursement is authorized and or otherwise appropriate. If so the EREVAL may then provide and or instruct the provision of the requested reimbursement payment for the employee.

In one implementation selected benefits may be further evaluated with respect to benefit selection rules to determine if the selected benefits and or designated purse allocations are compliant. When the determination is made at that benefits selection is concluded the EREVAL may evaluate the benefits selections based on retrieved rules e.g. one or more of those retrieved at of to determine if the selections are compliant therewith . If the selections are compliant the EREVAL may proceed to for benefits selection storage. Otherwise if one or more of the selections fails to comply with the rules an error handling procedure may be undertaken such as to provide an error message to the employee request reselection and or reallocation of benefits generate rule compliant suggestions and or the like .

In some embodiments the EREVAL may allow for the provision of a virtual punch clock for display to an employee such as at an employee computer terminal to allow the employee to indicate the start of work end of work break periods and or the like and to track employee activities implement labor regulations and or company labor policies determine compensation and or wages and or the like. In one implementation the EREVAL may be configured to automatically enforce labor regulations force breaks and or end of day quitting and or the like. In one implementation a virtual punch clock such as that described herein may be provided as a virtualized application to employee computing terminals in a call center or other such multi terminal work environment.

Typically users which may be people and or other systems may engage information technology systems e.g. computers to facilitate information processing. In turn computers employ processors to process information such processors may be referred to as central processing units CPU . One form of processor is referred to as a microprocessor. CPUs use communicative circuits to pass binary encoded signals acting as instructions to enable various operations. These instructions may be operational and or data instructions containing and or referencing other instructions and data in various processor accessible and operable areas of memory e.g. registers cache memory random access memory etc. . Such communicative instructions may be stored and or transmitted in batches e.g. batches of instructions as programs and or data components to facilitate desired operations. These stored instruction codes e.g. programs may engage the CPU circuit components and other motherboard and or system components to perform desired operations. One type of program is a computer operating system which may be executed by CPU on a computer the operating system enables and facilitates users to access and operate computer information technology and resources. Some resources that may be employed in information technology systems include input and output mechanisms through which data may pass into and out of a computer memory storage into which data may be saved and processors by which information may be processed. These information technology systems may be used to collect data for later retrieval analysis and manipulation which may be facilitated through a database program. These information technology systems provide interfaces that allow users to access and operate various system components.

In one embodiment the EREVAL controller may be connected to and or communicate with entities such as but not limited to one or more users from user input devices peripheral devices an optional cryptographic processor device and or a communications network .

Networks are commonly thought to comprise the interconnection and interoperation of clients servers and intermediary nodes in a graph topology. It should be noted that the term server as used throughout this application refers generally to a computer other device program or combination thereof that processes and responds to the requests of remote users across a communications network. Servers serve their information to requesting clients. The term client as used herein refers generally to a computer program other device user and or combination thereof that is capable of processing and making requests and obtaining and processing any responses from servers across a communications network. A computer other device program or combination thereof that facilitates processes information and requests and or furthers the passage of information from a source user to a destination user is commonly referred to as a node. Networks are generally thought to facilitate the transfer of information from source points to destinations. A node specifically tasked with furthering the passage of information from a source to a destination is commonly called a router. There are many forms of networks such as Local Area Networks LANs Pico networks Wide Area Networks WANs Wireless Networks WLANs etc. For example the Internet is generally accepted as being an interconnection of a multitude of networks whereby remote clients and servers may access and interoperate with one another.

The EREVAL controller may be based on computer systems that may comprise but are not limited to components such as a computer systemization connected to memory .

A computer systemization may comprise a clock central processing unit CPU s and or processor s these terms are used interchangeable throughout the disclosure unless noted to the contrary a memory e.g. a read only memory ROM a random access memory RAM etc. and or an interface bus and most frequently although not necessarily are all interconnected and or communicating through a system bus on one or more mother board s having conductive and or otherwise transportive circuit pathways through which instructions e.g. binary encoded signals may travel to effect communications operations storage etc. Optionally the computer systemization may be connected to an internal power source . Optionally a cryptographic processor may be connected to the system bus. The system clock typically has a crystal oscillator and generates a base signal through the computer systemization s circuit pathways. The clock is typically coupled to the system bus and various clock multipliers that will increase or decrease the base operating frequency for other components interconnected in the computer systemization. The clock and various components in a computer systemization drive signals embodying information throughout the system. Such transmission and reception of instructions embodying information throughout a computer systemization may be commonly referred to as communications. These communicative instructions may further be transmitted received and the cause of return and or reply communications beyond the instant computer systemization to communications networks input devices other computer systemizations peripheral devices and or the like. Of course any of the above components may be connected directly to one another connected to the CPU and or organized in numerous variations employed as exemplified by various computer systems.

The CPU comprises at least one high speed data processor adequate to execute program components for executing user and or system generated requests. Often the processors themselves will incorporate various specialized processing units such as but not limited to integrated system bus controllers memory management control units floating point units and even specialized processing sub units like graphics processing units digital signal processing units and or the like. Additionally processors may include internal fast access addressable memory and be capable of mapping and addressing memory beyond the processor itself internal memory may include but is not limited to fast registers various levels of cache memory e.g. level 1 2 3 etc. RAM etc. The processor may access this memory through the use of a memory address space that is accessible via instruction address which the processor can construct and decode allowing it to access a circuit path to a specific memory address space having a memory state. The CPU may be a microprocessor such as AMD s Athlon Duron and or Opteron ARM s application embedded and secure processors IBM and or Motorola s DragonBall and PowerPC IBM s and Sony s Cell processor Intel s Celeron Core 2 Duo Itanium Pentium Xeon and or XScale and or the like processor s . The CPU interacts with memory through instruction passing through conductive and or transportive conduits e.g. printed electronic and or optic circuits to execute stored instructions i.e. program code according to conventional data processing techniques. Such instruction passing facilitates communication within the EREVAL controller and beyond through various interfaces. Should processing requirements dictate a greater amount speed and or capacity distributed processors e.g. Distributed EREVAL mainframe multi core parallel and or super computer architectures may similarly be employed. Alternatively should deployment requirements dictate greater portability smaller Personal Digital Assistants PDAs may be employed.

Depending on the particular implementation features of the EREVAL may be achieved by implementing a microcontroller such as CAST s R8051XC2 microcontroller Intel s MCS 51 i.e. 8051 microcontroller and or the like. Also to implement certain features of the EREVAL some feature implementations may rely on embedded components such as Application Specific Integrated Circuit ASIC Digital Signal Processing DSP Field Programmable Gate Array FPGA and or the like embedded technology. For example any of the EREVAL component collection distributed or otherwise and or features may be implemented via the microprocessor and or via embedded components e.g. via ASIC coprocessor DSP FPGA and or the like. Alternately some implementations of the EREVAL may be implemented with embedded components that are configured and used to achieve a variety of features or signal processing.

Depending on the particular implementation the embedded components may include software solutions hardware solutions and or some combination of both hardware software solutions. For example EREVAL features discussed herein may be achieved through implementing FPGAs which are a semiconductor devices containing programmable logic components called logic blocks and programmable interconnects such as the high performance FPGA Virtex series and or the low cost Spartan series manufactured by Xilinx. Logic blocks and interconnects can be programmed by the customer or designer after the FPGA is manufactured to implement any of the EREVAL features. A hierarchy of programmable interconnects allow logic blocks to be interconnected as needed by the EREVAL system designer administrator somewhat like a one chip programmable breadboard. An FPGA s logic blocks can be programmed to perform the function of basic logic gates such as AND and XOR or more complex combinational functions such as decoders or simple mathematical functions. In most FPGAs the logic blocks also include memory elements which may be simple flip flops or more complete blocks of memory. In some circumstances the EREVAL may be developed on regular FPGAs and then migrated into a fixed version that more resembles ASIC implementations. Alternate or coordinating implementations may migrate EREVAL controller features to a final ASIC instead of or in addition to FPGAs. Depending on the implementation all of the aforementioned embedded components and microprocessors may be considered the CPU and or processor for the EREVAL.

The power source may be of any standard form for powering small electronic circuit board devices such as the following power cells alkaline lithium hydride lithium ion lithium polymer nickel cadmium solar cells and or the like. Other types of AC or DC power sources may be used as well. In the case of solar cells in one embodiment the case provides an aperture through which the solar cell may capture photonic energy. The power cell is connected to at least one of the interconnected subsequent components of the EREVAL thereby providing an electric current to all subsequent components. In one example the power source is connected to the system bus component . In an alternative embodiment an outside power source is provided through a connection across the I O interface. For example a USB and or IEEE 1394 connection carries both data and power across the connection and is therefore a suitable source of power.

Interface bus ses may accept connect and or communicate to a number of interface adapters conventionally although not necessarily in the form of adapter cards such as but not limited to input output interfaces I O storage interfaces network interfaces and or the like. Optionally cryptographic processor interfaces similarly may be connected to the interface bus.

Network interfaces may employ connection protocols such as but not limited to direct connect Ethernet thick thin twisted pair 10 100 1000 Base T and or the like Token Ring wireless connection such as IEEE 802.11a x and or the like. Should processing requirements dictate a greater amount speed and or capacity distributed network controllers e.g. Distributed EREVAL architectures may similarly be employed to pool load balance and or otherwise increase the communicative bandwidth required by the EREVAL controller. A communications network may be any one and or the combination of the following a direct interconnection the Internet a Local Area Network LAN a Metropolitan Area Network MAN an Operating Missions as Nodes on the Internet OMNI a secured custom connection a Wide Area Network WAN a wireless network e.g. employing protocols such as but not limited to a Wireless Application Protocol WAP I mode and or the like and or the like. A network interface may be regarded as a specialized form of an input output interface. Further multiple network interfaces may be used to engage with various communications network types . For example multiple network interfaces may be employed to allow for the communication over broadcast multicast and or unicast networks.

Input Output interfaces I O may accept communicate and or connect to user input devices peripheral devices cryptographic processor devices and or the like. I O may employ connection protocols such as but not limited to audio analog digital monaural RCA stereo and or the like data Apple Desktop Bus ADB IEEE 1394a b serial universal serial bus USB infrared joystick keyboard midi optical PC AT PS 2 parallel radio video interface Apple Desktop Connector ADC BNC coaxial component composite digital Digital Visual Interface DVI high definition multimedia interface HDMI RCA RF antennae S Video VGA and or the like wireless 802.11a b g n x Bluetooth code division multiple access CDMA global system for mobile communications GSM WiMax etc. and or the like. One typical output device may include a video display which typically comprises a Cathode Ray Tube CRT or Liquid Crystal Display LCD based monitor with an interface e.g. DVI circuitry and cable that accepts signals from a video interface may be used. The video interface composites information generated by a computer systemization and generates video signals based on the composited information in a video memory frame. Another output device is a television set which accepts signals from a video interface. Typically the video interface provides the composited video information through a video connection interface that accepts a video display interface e.g. an RCA composite video connector accepting an RCA composite video cable a DVI connector accepting a DVI display cable etc. .

It should be noted that although user input devices and peripheral devices may be employed the EREVAL controller may be embodied as an embedded dedicated and or monitor less i.e. headless device wherein access would be provided over a network interface connection.

Cryptographic units such as but not limited to microcontrollers processors interfaces and or devices may be attached and or communicate with the EREVAL controller. A MC68HC16 microcontroller manufactured by Motorola Inc. may be used for and or within cryptographic units. The MC68HC16 microcontroller utilizes a 16 bit multiply and accumulate instruction in the 16 MHz configuration and requires less than one second to perform a 512 bit RSA private key operation. Cryptographic units support the authentication of communications from interacting agents as well as allowing for anonymous transactions. Cryptographic units may also be configured as part of CPU. Equivalent microcontrollers and or processors may also be used. Other commercially available specialized cryptographic processors include the Broadcom s CryptoNetX and other Security Processors nCipher s nShield SafeNet s Luna PCI e.g. 7100 series Semaphore Communications 40 MHz Roadrunner 184 Sun s Cryptographic Accelerators e.g. Accelerator 6000 PCIe Board Accelerator 500 Daughtercard Via Nano Processor e.g. L2100 L2200 U2400 line which is capable of performing 500 MB s of cryptographic instructions VLSI Technology s 33 MHz 6868 and or the like.

Generally any mechanization and or embodiment allowing a processor to affect the storage and or retrieval of information is regarded as memory . However memory is a fungible technology and resource thus any number of memory embodiments may be employed in lieu of or in concert with one another. It is to be understood that the EREVAL controller and or a computer systemization may employ various forms of memory . For example a computer systemization may be configured wherein the functionality of on chip CPU memory e.g. registers RAM ROM and any other storage devices are provided by a paper punch tape or paper punch card mechanism of course such an embodiment would result in an extremely slow rate of operation. In a typical configuration memory will include ROM RAM and a storage device . A storage device may be any conventional computer system storage. Storage devices may include a drum a fixed and or removable magnetic disk drive a magneto optical drive an optical drive i.e. Blueray CD ROM RAM Recordable R ReWritable RW DVD R RW HD DVD R RW etc. an array of devices e.g. Redundant Array of Independent Disks RAID solid state memory devices USB memory solid state drives SSD etc. other processor readable storage mediums and or other devices of the like. Thus a computer systemization generally requires and makes use of memory.

The memory may contain a collection of program and or database components and or data such as but not limited to operating system component s operating system information server component s information server user interface component s user interface Web browser component s Web browser database s mail server component s mail client component s cryptographic server component s cryptographic server the EREVAL component s and or the like i.e. collectively a component collection . These components may be stored and accessed from the storage devices and or from storage devices accessible through an interface bus. Although non conventional program components such as those in the component collection typically are stored in a local storage device they may also be loaded and or stored in memory such as peripheral devices RAM remote storage facilities through a communications network ROM various forms of memory and or the like.

The operating system component is an executable program component facilitating the operation of the EREVAL controller. Typically the operating system facilitates access of I O network interfaces peripheral devices storage devices and or the like. The operating system may be a highly fault tolerant scalable and secure system such as Apple Macintosh OS X Server AT T Nan 9 Be OS Unix and Unix like system distributions such as AT T s UNIX Berkley Software Distribution BSD variations such as FreeBSD NetBSD OpenBSD and or the like Linux distributions such as Red Hat Ubuntu and or the like and or the like operating systems. However more limited and or less secure operating systems also may be employed such as Apple Macintosh OS IBM OS 2 Microsoft DOS Microsoft Windows 2000 2003 3.1 95 98 CE Millenium NT Vista XP Server Palm OS and or the like. An operating system may communicate to and or with other components in a component collection including itself and or the like. Most frequently the operating system communicates with other program components user interfaces and or the like. For example the operating system may contain communicate generate obtain and or provide program component system user and or data communications requests and or responses. The operating system once executed by the CPU may enable the interaction with communications networks data I O peripheral devices program components memory user input devices and or the like. The operating system may provide communications protocols that allow the EREVAL controller to communicate with other entities through a communications network . Various communication protocols may be used by the EREVAL controller as a subcarrier transport mechanism for interaction such as but not limited to multicast TCP IP UDP unicast and or the like.

An information server component is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. The information server may be a conventional Internet information server such as but not limited to Apache Software Foundation s Apache Microsoft s Internet Information Server and or the like. The information server may allow for the execution of program components through facilities such as Active Server Page ASP ActiveX ANSI Objective C C and or .NET Common Gateway Interface CGI scripts dynamic D hypertext markup language HTML FLASH Java JavaScript Practical Extraction Report Language PERL Hypertext Pre Processor PHP pipes Python wireless application protocol WAP WebObjects and or the like. The information server may support secure communications protocols such as but not limited to File Transfer Protocol FTP HyperText Transfer Protocol HTTP Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTPS Secure Socket Layer SSL messaging protocols e.g. America Online AOL Instant Messenger AIM Application Exchange APEX ICQ Internet Relay Chat IRC Microsoft Network MSN Messenger Service Presence and Instant Messaging Protocol PRIM Internet Engineering Task Force s IETF s Session Initiation Protocol SIP SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions SIMPLE open XML based Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol XMPP i.e. Jabber or Open Mobile Alliance s OMA s Instant Messaging and Presence Service IMPS Yahoo Instant Messenger Service and or the like. The information server provides results in the form of Web pages to Web browsers and allows for the manipulated generation of the Web pages through interaction with other program components. After a Domain Name System DNS resolution portion of an HTTP request is resolved to a particular information server the information server resolves requests for information at specified locations on the EREVAL controller based on the remainder of the HTTP request. For example a request such as http 123.124.125.126 myInformation.html might have the IP portion of the request 123.124.125.126 resolved by a DNS server to an information server at that IP address that information server might in turn further parse the http request for the myInformation.html portion of the request and resolve it to a location in memory containing the information myInformation.html. Additionally other information serving protocols may be employed across various ports e.g. FTP communications across port and or the like. An information server may communicate to and or with other components in a component collection including itself and or facilities of the like. Most frequently the information server communicates with the EREVAL database operating systems other program components user interfaces Web browsers and or the like.

Access to the EREVAL database may be achieved through a number of database bridge mechanisms such as through scripting languages as enumerated below e.g. CGI and through inter application communication channels as enumerated below e.g. CORBA WebObjects etc. . Any data requests through a Web browser are parsed through the bridge mechanism into appropriate grammars as required by the EREVAL. In one embodiment the information server would provide a Web form accessible by a Web browser. Entries made into supplied fields in the Web form are tagged as having been entered into the particular fields and parsed as such. The entered terms are then passed along with the field tags which act to instruct the parser to generate queries directed to appropriate tables and or fields. In one embodiment the parser may generate queries in standard SQL by instantiating a search string with the proper join select commands based on the tagged text entries wherein the resulting command is provided over the bridge mechanism to the EREVAL as a query. Upon generating query results from the query the results are passed over the bridge mechanism and may be parsed for formatting and generation of a new results Web page by the bridge mechanism. Such a new results Web page is then provided to the information server which may supply it to the requesting Web browser.

Also an information server may contain communicate generate obtain and or provide program component system user and or data communications requests and or responses.

The function of computer interfaces in some respects is similar to automobile operation interfaces. Automobile operation interface elements such as steering wheels gearshifts and speedometers facilitate the access operation and display of automobile resources functionality and status. Computer interaction interface elements such as check boxes cursors menus scrollers and windows collectively and commonly referred to as widgets similarly facilitate the access operation and display of data and computer hardware and operating system resources functionality and status. Operation interfaces are commonly called user interfaces. Graphical user interfaces GUIs such as the Apple Macintosh Operating System s Aqua IBM s OS 2 Microsoft s Windows 2000 2003 3.1 95 98 CE Millenium NT XP Vista 7 i.e. Aero Unix s X Windows e.g. which may include additional Unix graphic interface libraries and layers such as K Desktop Environment KDE mythTV and GNU Network Object Model Environment GNOME web interface libraries e.g. ActiveX AJAX D HTML FLASH Java JavaScript etc. interface libraries such as but not limited to Dojo jQuery UI MooTools Prototype script.aculo.us SWFObject Yahoo User Interface any of which may be used and provide a baseline and means of accessing and displaying information graphically to users.

A user interface component is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. The user interface may be a conventional graphic user interface as provided by with and or atop operating systems and or operating environments such as already discussed. The user interface may allow for the display execution interaction manipulation and or operation of program components and or system facilities through textual and or graphical facilities. The user interface provides a facility through which users may affect interact and or operate a computer system. A user interface may communicate to and or with other components in a component collection including itself and or facilities of the like. Most frequently the user interface communicates with operating systems other program components and or the like. The user interface may contain communicate generate obtain and or provide program component system user and or data communications requests and or responses.

A Web browser component is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. The Web browser may be a conventional hypertext viewing application such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator. Secure Web browsing may be supplied with 128 bit or greater encryption by way of HTTPS SSL and or the like. Web browsers allowing for the execution of program components through facilities such as ActiveX AJAX D HTML FLASH Java JavaScript web browser plug in APIs e.g. FireFox Safari Plug in and or the like APIs and or the like. Web browsers and like information access tools may be integrated into PDAs cellular telephones and or other mobile devices. A Web browser may communicate to and or with other components in a component collection including itself and or facilities of the like. Most frequently the Web browser communicates with information servers operating systems integrated program components e.g. plug ins and or the like e.g. it may contain communicate generate obtain and or provide program component system user and or data communications requests and or responses. Of course in place of a Web browser and information server a combined application may be developed to perform similar functions of both. The combined application would similarly affect the obtaining and the provision of information to users user agents and or the like from the EREVAL enabled nodes. The combined application may be nugatory on systems employing standard Web browsers.

A mail server component is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU . The mail server may be a conventional Internet mail server such as but not limited to sendmail Microsoft Exchange and or the like. The mail server may allow for the execution of program components through facilities such as ASP ActiveX ANSI Objective C C and or .NET CGI scripts Java JavaScript PERL PHP pipes Python WebObjects and or the like. The mail server may support communications protocols such as but not limited to Internet message access protocol IMAP Messaging Application Programming Interface MAPI Microsoft Exchange post office protocol POPS simple mail transfer protocol SMTP and or the like. The mail server can route forward and process incoming and outgoing mail messages that have been sent relayed and or otherwise traversing through and or to the EREVAL.

Access to the EREVAL mail may be achieved through a number of APIs offered by the individual Web server components and or the operating system.

Also a mail server may contain communicate generate obtain and or provide program component system user and or data communications requests information and or responses.

A mail client component is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU . The mail client may be a conventional mail viewing application such as Apple Mail Microsoft Entourage Microsoft Outlook Microsoft Outlook Express Mozilla Thunderbird and or the like. Mail clients may support a number of transfer protocols such as IMAP Microsoft Exchange POPS SMTP and or the like. A mail client may communicate to and or with other components in a component collection including itself and or facilities of the like. Most frequently the mail client communicates with mail servers operating systems other mail clients and or the like e.g. it may contain communicate generate obtain and or provide program component system user and or data communications requests information and or responses. Generally the mail client provides a facility to compose and transmit electronic mail messages.

A cryptographic server component is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU cryptographic processor cryptographic processor interface cryptographic processor device and or the like. Cryptographic processor interfaces will allow for expedition of encryption and or decryption requests by the cryptographic component however the cryptographic component alternatively may run on a conventional CPU. The cryptographic component allows for the encryption and or decryption of provided data. The cryptographic component allows for both symmetric and asymmetric e.g. Pretty Good Protection PGP encryption and or decryption. The cryptographic component may employ cryptographic techniques such as but not limited to digital certificates e.g. X.509 authentication framework digital signatures dual signatures enveloping password access protection public key management and or the like. The cryptographic component will facilitate numerous encryption and or decryption security protocols such as but not limited to checksum Data Encryption Standard DES Elliptical Curve Encryption ECC International Data Encryption Algorithm IDEA Message Digest 5 MD5 which is a one way hash function passwords Rivest Cipher RC5 Rijndael RSA which is an Internet encryption and authentication system that uses an algorithm developed in 1977 by Ron Rivest Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman Secure Hash Algorithm SHA Secure Socket Layer SSL Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTPS and or the like. Employing such encryption security protocols the EREVAL may encrypt all incoming and or outgoing communications and may serve as node within a virtual private network VPN with a wider communications network. The cryptographic component facilitates the process of security authorization whereby access to a resource is inhibited by a security protocol wherein the cryptographic component effects authorized access to the secured resource. In addition the cryptographic component may provide unique identifiers of content e.g. employing and MD5 hash to obtain a unique signature for an digital audio file. A cryptographic component may communicate to and or with other components in a component collection including itself and or facilities of the like. The cryptographic component supports encryption schemes allowing for the secure transmission of information across a communications network to enable the EREVAL component to engage in secure transactions if so desired. The cryptographic component facilitates the secure accessing of resources on the EREVAL and facilitates the access of secured resources on remote systems i.e. it may act as a client and or server of secured resources. Most frequently the cryptographic component communicates with information servers operating systems other program components and or the like. The cryptographic component may contain communicate generate obtain and or provide program component system user and or data communications requests and or responses.

The EREVAL database component may be embodied in a database and its stored data. The database is a stored program component which is executed by the CPU the stored program component portion configuring the CPU to process the stored data. The database may be a conventional fault tolerant relational scalable secure database such as Oracle or Sybase. Relational databases are an extension of a flat file. Relational databases consist of a series of related tables. The tables are interconnected via a key field. Use of the key field allows the combination of the tables by indexing against the key field i.e. the key fields act as dimensional pivot points for combining information from various tables. Relationships generally identify links maintained between tables by matching primary keys. Primary keys represent fields that uniquely identify the rows of a table in a relational database. More precisely they uniquely identify rows of a table on the one side of a one to many relationship.

Alternatively the EREVAL database may be implemented using various standard data structures such as an array hash linked list struct structured text file e.g. XML table and or the like. Such data structures may be stored in memory and or in structured files. In another alternative an object oriented database may be used such as Frontier ObjectStore Poet Zope and or the like. Object databases can include a number of object collections that are grouped and or linked together by common attributes they may be related to other object collections by some common attributes. Object oriented databases perform similarly to relational databases with the exception that objects are not just pieces of data but may have other types of functionality encapsulated within a given object. If the EREVAL database is implemented as a data structure the use of the EREVAL database may be integrated into another component such as the EREVAL component . Also the database may be implemented as a mix of data structures objects and relational structures. Databases may be consolidated and or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing techniques. Portions of databases e.g. tables may be exported and or imported and thus decentralized and or integrated.

In one embodiment the database component includes several tables . A ClientProgram table may include fields such as but not limited to ProgramID ProgramCode ProgramName Description EndDate CreatedBy CreatedDate UpdatedBy UpdatedDate Timestamp TS AutoDeductFlag SalesID foreign key FK ClientID FK CountryID FK BusinessTypeID FK VerticalID FK ProgramTypeID FK EntityID FK InvoiceGroupID FK and or the like.

One or more of the tables discussed above may support and or track multiple entity accounts on a EREVAL.

In one embodiment the EREVAL database may interact with other database systems. For example employing a distributed database system queries and data access by search EREVAL component may treat the combination of the EREVAL database an integrated data security layer database as a single database entity.

In one embodiment user programs may contain various user interface primitives which may serve to update the EREVAL. Also various accounts may require custom database tables depending upon the environments and the types of clients the EREVAL may need to serve. It should be noted that any unique fields may be designated as a key field throughout. In an alternative embodiment these tables have been decentralized into their own databases and their respective database controllers i.e. individual database controllers for each of the above tables . Employing standard data processing techniques one may further distribute the databases over several computer systemizations and or storage devices. Similarly configurations of the decentralized database controllers may be varied by consolidating and or distributing the various database components . The EREVAL may be configured to keep track of various settings inputs and parameters via database controllers.

The EREVAL database may communicate to and or with other components in a component collection including itself and or facilities of the like. Most frequently the EREVAL database communicates with the EREVAL component other program components and or the like. The database may contain retain and provide information regarding other nodes and data.

The EREVAL component is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. In one embodiment the EREVAL component incorporates any and or all combinations of the aspects of the EREVAL that was discussed in the previous figures. As such the EREVAL affects accessing obtaining and the provision of information services transactions and or the like across various communications networks.

The EREVAL component enables the management of enterprise and human resources the provision of tailored and or personalized computing experiences massively scalable monitoring and regulation of personnel efficient collection organization distribution and presentation of enterprise data and or the like and use of the EREVAL.

The EREVAL component enabling access of information between nodes may be developed by employing standard development tools and languages such as but not limited to Apache components Assembly ActiveX binary executables ANSI Objective C C and or .NET database adapters CGI scripts Java JavaScript mapping tools procedural and object oriented development tools PERL PHP Python shell scripts SQL commands web application server extensions web development environments and libraries e.g. Microsoft s ActiveX Adobe AIR FLEX FLASH AJAX D HTML Dojo Java JavaScript jQuery UI MooTools Prototype script.aculo.us Simple Object Access Protocol SOAP SWFObject Yahoo User Interface and or the like WebObjects and or the like. In one embodiment the EREVAL server employs a cryptographic server to encrypt and decrypt communications. The EREVAL component may communicate to and or with other components in a component collection including itself and or facilities of the like. Most frequently the EREVAL component communicates with the EREVAL database operating systems other program components and or the like. The EREVAL may contain communicate generate obtain and or provide program component system user and or data communications requests and or responses.

The structure and or operation of any of the EREVAL node controller components may be combined consolidated and or distributed in any number of ways to facilitate development and or deployment. Similarly the component collection may be combined in any number of ways to facilitate deployment and or development. To accomplish this one may integrate the components into a common code base or in a facility that can dynamically load the components on demand in an integrated fashion.

The component collection may be consolidated and or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing and or development techniques. Multiple instances of any one of the program components in the program component collection may be instantiated on a single node and or across numerous nodes to improve performance through load balancing and or data processing techniques. Furthermore single instances may also be distributed across multiple controllers and or storage devices e.g. databases. All program component instances and controllers working in concert may do so through standard data processing communication techniques.

The configuration of the EREVAL controller will depend on the context of system deployment. Factors such as but not limited to the budget capacity location and or use of the underlying hardware resources may affect deployment requirements and configuration. Regardless of if the configuration results in more consolidated and or integrated program components results in a more distributed series of program components and or results in some combination between a consolidated and distributed configuration data may be communicated obtained and or provided. Instances of components consolidated into a common code base from the program component collection may communicate obtain and or provide data. This may be accomplished through intra application data processing communication techniques such as but not limited to data referencing e.g. pointers internal messaging object instance variable communication shared memory space variable passing and or the like.

If component collection components are discrete separate and or external to one another then communicating obtaining and or providing data with and or to other component components may be accomplished through inter application data processing communication techniques such as but not limited to Application Program Interfaces API information passage distributed Component Object Model D COM Distributed Object Linking and Embedding D OLE and or the like Common Object Request Broker Architecture CORBA local and remote application program interfaces Jini Remote Method Invocation RMI SOAP process pipes shared files and or the like. Messages sent between discrete component components for inter application communication or within memory spaces of a singular component for intra application communication may be facilitated through the creation and parsing of a grammar. A grammar may be developed by using standard development tools such as lex yacc XML and or the like which allow for grammar generation and parsing functionality which in turn may form the basis of communication messages within and between components. For example a grammar may be arranged to recognize the tokens of an HTTP post command e.g. 

where Value1 is discerned as being a parameter because http is part of the grammar syntax and what follows is considered part of the post value. Similarly with such a grammar a variable Value1 may be inserted into an http post command and then sent. The grammar syntax itself may be presented as structured data that is interpreted and or other wise used to generate the parsing mechanism e.g. a syntax description text file as processed by lex yacc etc. . Also once the parsing mechanism is generated and or instantiated it itself may process and or parse structured data such as but not limited to character e.g. tab delineated text HTML structured text streams XML and or the like structured data. In another embodiment inter application data processing protocols themselves may have integrated and or readily available parsers e.g. the SOAP parser that may be employed to parse communications data. Further the parsing grammar may be used beyond message parsing but may also be used to parse databases data collections data stores structured data and or the like. Again the desired configuration will depend upon the context environment and requirements of system deployment.
