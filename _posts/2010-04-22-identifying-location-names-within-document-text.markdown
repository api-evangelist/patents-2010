Identifying location names within documents can establish an association between the documents and the locations. For example when information related to the location is sought the associated document or information from the document may be provided. There is a rich body of documents that may provide information associated with a location. For example travelogues are textual descriptions of a person s experience with a particular location. For instance a person might travel to New York City and write a travelogue that describes their travel experience.

Travelogues are currently written and shared in a variety of different scenarios on the Internet. For instance travelogues can be shared by way of World Wide Web Web sites Web forums Web logs blogs social networking sites and in myriad other ways. A large number of such sites are currently available on the Internet for writing and sharing travelogues. This large number of disparate sites containing travelogues and similar documents often proves troublesome to users or automated search mechanisms attempting to identify locations within the documents in a precise and unambiguous fashion.

Concepts and technologies are described herein for identifying location names within document text. Through an implementation of the concepts and technologies presented herein functionality can be provided for identifying location names within articles websites travelogues or other such documents. For instance documents containing the names of cities regions countries landmarks or other locations may be associated with those locations. The location names may be unambiguously identified even when the location names may also have common word meanings that are not location associated or when the location name may be associated with more than one location.

According to one aspect presented herein a word or phrase may be identified as either a location name or a common word. This differentiation may be referred to here as location detection. Location detection can use prior knowledge of the probability of a word being a location name or else being a common word that is not location associated. These probabilities may be collected from a corpus of many documents or articles.

According to another aspect presented herein a location name that may be associated with several geographic locations may be disambiguated to only the intended location instance. This disambiguation may be referred to here as location recognition. Location recognition may predict the intended location instance of a location name using hints from other location names occurring within the same document.

According to yet another aspect presented herein results from location recognition may be used to validate results from location detection. For example if several location names are found near a word W within a document it is more likely that the word W is a location name than a common word. The two operations of location detection and location recognition may be coupled with one another to extract or identify location names from textual content.

It should be appreciated that the above described subject matter might also be implemented as a computer controlled apparatus a computer process a computing system or as an article of manufacture such as a computer readable storage medium. These and various other features will be apparent from a reading of the following Detailed Description and a review of the associated drawings.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended that this Summary be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter. Furthermore the claimed subject matter is not limited to implementations that solve any or all disadvantages noted in any part of this disclosure.

The following detailed description is directed to technologies for identifying location names within document text. The technology presented herein can support geographical term search related to location and travel information with improved efficacy in comparison to tradition keyword searches. The focus on location oriented documents can support services while a keyword search on such documents may fail at certain location oriented searches. Traditional keyword searches generally attach no special meaning to location words and therefore may miss cues clues and other indicators of implied informational content. For example when searching for Central Park in New York one can search for New York and Central Park. However if a document about Central Park does not mention New York or only does for a small number of terms then that document may have a low relevance to the query for New York and Central Park while using a traditional keyword based search engine. In contrast the technology presented herein can identify the term Central Park as being a park in New York thereby increasing the relevance of the document to the search even when the document does not explicitly mention New York.

Another example of a weakness in traditional keyword based searching occurs when a query term has strong ambiguity as both a geographical term and a common term. One such term is mobile being a location name for city in Alabama and also related to an ability to move or relating to wireless communications. Due to the additional common word or non geographical meanings a traditional keyword based search engine will generally return extra irrelevant results. These extra results may be associated with the non location senses of the term.

Yet another example of a weakness in traditional keyword based searching is encountered when integrating travel or location related services to keyword based search engines. For example it may be an added difficulty for a traditional keyword based search engine to recommend popular photos related to a location name supplied by a user. However the technology presented herein supports attaching a geographical meaning to a location word which can then relate photos or other resources to that geographical meaning. For example if user queries photos for Central Park photos from the Central Park in New York City may be automatically associated in response.

While the subject matter described herein is presented in the general context of program modules that execute in conjunction with the execution of an operating system and application programs on a computer system those skilled in the art will recognize that other implementations may be performed in combination with other types of program modules. Generally program modules include routines programs components data structures and other types of structures that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. Moreover those skilled in the art will appreciate that the subject matter described herein may be practiced with other computer system configurations including hand held devices multiprocessor systems microprocessor based or programmable consumer electronics minicomputers mainframe computers and the like.

In the following detailed description references are made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof and which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments or examples. Referring now to the drawings in which like numerals represent like elements throughout the several figures aspects of a computing system computer readable storage medium and computer implemented methodology for identifying location names within document text will be presented.

Referring now to aspects of one operating environment for the various embodiments presented herein will be described. A location name identification module can identify location names within one or more documents . The documents may be located on servers within a network . For example the documents may be travel web sites travel blogs travelogues or any other documents containing references to geographical locations. The location name identification module may use a gazetteer of location names to perform the location name identifications.

The identified location names may be used to construct a location name index . The location name index may be used to search the documents for location names. The location name index may be searched by a location query . The location query can identify which if any of the documents contain or relate to a location name. For example a subset of the documents may contain references to Hawaii. This subset may be returned using a location query for the location word Hawaii against the location name index . The location query may originate from a user a search engine any other software module or any information retrieval mechanism.

The gazetteer used by the location name identification module may be considered a geographical directory or dictionary. There may be millions or more of location names in the gazetteer . Each location name within the gazetteer may have one or more location senses. A sense for a term may be considered a possible meaning or context for the term. The location senses may be listed in a hierarchical fashion. For example the location name Statue of Liberty may have three location senses in the gazetteer . The first location sense being Statue of Liberty the second location sense being New York Statue of Liberty and the third second location sense being New York New York Statue of Liberty. Similarly the location name Flamingo may have three location senses in the gazetteer . The first location sense being Flamingo the second location sense being Florida Monroe Flamingo and the third second location sense being Florida Orange Flamingo. 

Referring now to a software architecture diagram showing aspects of software components utilized in various embodiments presented herein will be described. The location name identification module can operate on one or more input documents each denoted herein as D to perform the interrelated tasks of location detection and location recognition .

The task of location detection can attempt to resolve the ambiguity between location senses of a term and non location senses of the term such as those associated with the term mobile as location name for a city in Alabama and a common word relating to being movable. Location detection can employ the gazetteer to find all possible location term candidates as referred to herein as X within document Dwhere i counts over documents and j counts over location terms within the documents. Where a term may be classified as either a location term or not without equivocation the location detection may be considered a binary classification problem. Such a problem may be approached using a binary support vector machine SVM model. An SVM can perform classification or regression using a set of supervised learning algorithms. For example an SVM training algorithm may be taught using set of training examples where each example is associated with one of two categories. From this training the SVM algorithm can build a model that predicts which of the two categories a newly encountered element belongs to.

The task of location recognition can attempt to resolve the ambiguity between multiple location senses of a term such as those associated with Flamingo a city name in Orange County Florida and also a city name in Monroe County Florida. The location disambiguation performed by location recognition may be considered a ranking problem and may be approached using a rank SVM model. A score propagation approach may be used to resolve the ambiguities of location names as discussed in further detail with respect to .

Location detection can disambiguate between geographical and non geographical ambiguities. Similarly location recognition can disambiguate between geographical and geographical ambiguities. It should be appreciated that a location name may simultaneously have geographical non geographical ambiguity and also geographical geographical ambiguity. For example flamingo has geographical non geographical ambiguity due to its non location related sense relating to a type of bird. The term flamingo also has geographical geographical ambiguity due to multiple cities in the state of Florida and numerous location senses related to the city of Las Vegas Nev.

Location detection and location recognition can interrelate in an iterative fashion. While location recognition may be based on the results from location detection location detection can then be improved by results from the location recognition . For example the presence of the location name Alabama or other location names related to Alabama or Mobile Ala. within a document can increase the likelihood that the word mobile within the document is the location name of a city and not a reference to the ability to move. Thus resolving the location recognition can assist the disambiguation between location words and common words in location detection .

Applying location detection and location recognition to a set of documents or a corpus a search index may be generated. Index generation can provide a unique location sense for each identified location name. A corresponding focus score may also be provided. For example each location name in a given document may be assigned a focus score as a measure of the location name s relevance to the given document. An inversion table may be generated according to location senses by relevance score. Thus index generation can provide a search index to support location sense based search. For example if the query relates to New York New York Central Park a travel note about the Central Park of New York N.Y. may be returned from searching the index.

The location name identification module can also leverage conditional term probabilities for location names. For example the term mobile has a higher probability of being a location name when conditioned upon the presence of the term Alabama. The location name identification module can also leverage popularity metrics from other information contexts. For example location tags on photos within an online photo sharing system are significantly more numerous for Paris France than for Paris Ill. This statistical information can serve as a proxy for the likelihood that a document containing the term Paris is related to France instead of being related to Illinois.

Yet another set of cues for location names within a text document includes grammatical unigrams and bigrams. A unigram involves a single word neighboring the term in question. For instance leaving may be used as a prefix unigram to imply an increased likelihood of a location name. For example in the text . . . when they were leaving Miami . . . the single term leaving is a prefix to the location name Miami. Similarly area may be used as a postfix unigram to imply an increased likelihood of a location name. For example in the text . . . found in the Seattle area . . . the single term area is a postfix to the location name Seattle. 

A bigram involves a double word neighboring the term in question. For example arrive in may be a prefix bigram to a location word such as in the text . . . they will arrive in London this afternoon . . . . Similarly from where may be a postfix bigram to a location word such as in the text . . . a great view of Seattle from where I was . . . . Lastly a combined prefix and postfix bigram may split the bigram around the location name. For example the combined bigram from . . . to may sandwich around a location name such as with . . . flew from New York to the final destination . . . . 

Referring now to a data relationship diagram illustrates a location sense tree according to various embodiments presented herein. The location name identification module can organize observed terms Hawaii at tree nodes Puhimau Crater at tree node and Pearl Harbor at tree nodes along with hidden terms root node Alaska at tree node Tennessee at tree node Honolulu at tree node Juneau at tree node and Meigs at tree node into a location sense tree . In this example there are three location sense candidates for Pearl Harbor as found within the gazetteer . The three location senses are Hawaii Honolulu Pearl Harbor Alaska Juneau Pearl Harbor and Tennessee Meigs Pearl Harbor. It may be quite difficult to identify the correct location sense referred to by Pearl Habor using only the single term by itself. However the additional observation of Puhimau Crater within the document relates to a location in Hawaii and thus implies a high likelihood to the Hawaii Honolulu sense of Pearl Harbor.

The determined unique location sense of each observed location name and its relevance score from location detection and location recognition can imply the hidden location senses and their corresponding relevance scores. The location name identification module can implement score propagation based disambiguation of location names. Location disambiguation can determine which location name is the intended context within a given document. Each location name can be assigned a unique location sense in a given document. Intuitively the location name New York may sound more like a geographic location than the location name Flamingo. 

In order to measure these ambiguities quantitatively and solve the location disambiguation task a probability based method may be used. Pmay be used to represent the probability of a location name being an intended location. Suppose a location name X has k location senses given as X . . . X. Then P X gives the probability of location X having the location sense X. If location X only has one location sense X then P X will be 1.

Once Pis determined for each location name and Pis determined for each location sense a score propagation algorithm may perform the location disambiguation for a given document. Suppose location names X . . . Xhave been extracted from a given document and the duplicate location names have been removed so that the location names are unique from each other in the sequence. Some location names have only one location sense but others may have multiply location senses. These location senses may be used to construct the location sense tree . The location sense tree has a root node and each node in the tree is a location sense. Each location sense has a unique location name but each location name may have many location senses. Where a location sense s location name is contained directly in the document the location sense is said to be an observed location sense. A hidden location sense represents a location name that is not directly contained within the document. For example given a location name sequence Pearl Harbor Puhimau Crater Hawaii the generated location sense sequence may be

The observed location senses are illustrated in solid lines while the hidden location senses are illustrated in dotted lines. For example the location sense Hawaii Honolulu Pearl Harbor is an observed location sense while the location sense Hawaii Honolulu is a hidden location sense.

Each observed location sense has an initial score and can propagate its initial score to other location senses. Its initial score is proportional to its P its P and the number of times it appears in the given document according to the following expression where P X is the probability of Xbeing a location according to the corpus P X is the probability of Xhaving location sense Xaccording to the corpus and n X D is the number of times that Xappears within the document D.

After such initialization the scores may be propagated through the location sense tree such that the propagated score will decay as it travels along the branches of the tree. When a location sense propagates its score closer location senses can receive more of the propagated score than further location senses. After the propagation process the unique location sense of a location name in the given document can be the location sense of the location name that gets the highest score. In the illustrated example the score propagation process can result in the location name Pearl Harbor having the unique location sense Hawaii Hawaii Pearl Harbor. The score propagation algorithm can be described formally using the following expressions 

This score propagation algorithm can be implemented efficiently. Heuristic rules can be easily integrated into the propagation algorithm. The rules can be used to adjust Pand Pin a given document. Since Pand Pare computed from the corpus they can represent the historical knowledge about the location names and location senses. Within a given document some heuristic rules can be used to adjust Pand P. For example if the pattern the city of X appears in the document then P X can be set to one with respect to the given document. If the pattern Central Park New York N.Y. appears in the document whereby the sense of Central Park is clear then P New York New York Central Park can be set to one and other location senses of Central Park may be removed from the location sense tree .

An iterative approach may be applied for computing P. The conditional notation c X D may be used to represent the confidence of location name X to be a real geographic location if it has location sense Xin document D. Generally c X D should be high when nearby location senses of location sense Xappear in the document D. The nearby location senses may be ancestral location senses or offspring location senses depending upon their relative positioning within the location sense tree . The value may be used to present a decay factor between generations within the tree. Thus the follow expression may be used to compute c X D or the confidence of X being location sense Xgiven document D 

The root node may be excluded from the set f X D since all nodes are assumed to related to root node . Once c X D is computed P X D may be computed. The value for P X D may be computed as the weighted sum of the confidence of location senses. P X D and Pcan be computed as shown in the following expressions 

Here it is shown that Prelies on P. It will also be shown that Pmay rely upon P. Thus the iterative relationship between the computation of Pand P. Pmay be initialized to a default initial value. If a location name X is not observed within the corpus then P X will take on this initial value. An example default value may be 0.1 or any other specified value.

Similar to the score propagation technique an iterative approach may be applied for computing P. After initializing P X to 1 a X the values for Pmay be computed iteratively according to the following expressions 

After the location disambiguation phase each location name within a document can be associated with a unique location sense. These unique location senses may be used to construct an updated location sense tree where the ambiguous location senses have been removed. This updated tree may be referred to as a disambiguated tree. A measure of the relevance of a location sense to a given document can support search indexing. Observed location names may be highly correlative and their hierarchical relationships can imply useful measures of term to document relevance. A bottom up propagation algorithm may be used to perform a computation of accurate relevance between a location name term and a particular document. An initial score for each location sense in the disambiguated tree may be given by the expression 

A location sense can have score contributions from each of its offspring location senses. An offspring location sense can propagate a portion of its normalized initial score to the location sense in question. Following this bottom up propagation from offspring the final score of each location sense in the disambiguated tree may be computed from the following expression where Yis one of the offspring location senses to X.

Referring now to additional details will be provided regarding the embodiments presented herein for identifying location names within document text. In particular is a flow diagram showing a routine that illustrates aspects of one process presented herein for training identifiers of location names.

It should be appreciated that the logical operations described herein with respect to and the other FIGURES are implemented 1 as a sequence of computer implemented acts or program modules running on a computing system and or 2 as interconnected machine logic circuits or circuit modules within the computing system. The implementation is a matter of choice dependent on the performance and other requirements of the computing system. Accordingly the logical operations described herein are referred to variously as states operations structural devices acts or modules. These operations structural devices acts and modules may be implemented in software in firmware in special purpose digital logic and any combination thereof. It should also be appreciated that more or fewer operations may be performed than shown in the figures and described herein. These operations may also be performed in a different order than those described herein.

The routine begins at operation where the location name identification module can receive a location gazetteer . The gazetteer may be considered a geographical directory or dictionary. Each location name within the gazetteer may have one or more location senses. A sense for a term may be considered a possible meaning or context for the term. The location senses may be listed in a hierarchical fashion.

At operation the location name identification module can receive a corpus of documents. The corpus or body of documents can define a search space for establishing a search index over. Statistics may be computed from the corpus. These statistics can include location names and location senses within the documents of the corpus. The location names and location senses may be determined from the location gazetteer received at operation .

At operation the location name identification module can receive a set of annotated documents. The annotated documents may be used for training the detection classifier and or the recognition model. The annotations may have been manually applied as labels of the location sense for each possible location word in each of the annotated documents.

At operation the location name identification module can extract features. Feature extraction may be performed using a variety of techniques discussed herein. For example feature extraction may leverage bigram statistics computed from the annotated documents location prior statistics and location sense prior statistics computed from documents.

Feature extraction may also leverage popularity metrics from other information contexts. For example location tags on photos within an online photo sharing system are significantly more numerous for Paris France than for Paris Ill. This statistical information can serve as a proxy for the likelihood that a document containing the term Paris is related to France instead of being related to Illinois. Thus the number of photo entries for a location sense is in direct proportion to the location sense prior statistic.

Feature extraction may also leverage relevance scores propagated among location senses within a document. These relevance scores can establish how relevant the location sense or location name is to each document. The relevance score may be used to establish search indices for the document

Feature extraction may also leverage location sense hierarchies for the documents. Candidate locations names within a document may be related according to the possible location senses for each location name. The location senses may be determined from the location gazetteer received at operation .

Feature extraction may also leverage heuristic clues to detection and recognition. Using unigrams bigrams outside indicators and various other heuristic clues the accuracy of location detection and location recognition may be improved.

At operation the location name identification module can train a classifier for location name detection. Training of the location name detection classifier may be based on the annotated documents and the various extracted information. Training of the location name detection classifier may use a SVM learning algorithm.

At operation the location name identification module can train a model for location sense recognition. Training of the location sense recognition model may be based on the annotated documents and the various extracted information. Training of the location sense recognition model may use a ranked SVM algorithm. The routine can terminate after operation .

Referring now to additional details will be provided regarding the embodiments presented herein for identifying location names within document text. In particular is a flow diagram showing a routine that illustrates aspects of one process presented herein for detection and recognition of location names.

The routine begins at operation where the location name identification module can receive a document. The document may be from the corpus or the received document may be a new document for indexing.

At operation the location name identification module can detect location names in the document. Location detection can attempt to disambiguate location names from common words. Location detection may be viewed as a binary detection problem wherein every term in the document is detected to be either a location name or a common word.

At operation the location name identification module can recognize location senses of the identified location names. Location recognition can attempt to disambiguate multiple location sense from a location name. For example the term Venice may be disambiguated between a city in Italy California or Florida. Location recognition may be viewed as a ranking problem wherein each possible location sense for a given location word is ranked according to its likelihood for being the actual intended location sense of the document s author.

At operation the location name identification module can perform iterative detection and recognition. Because of the interdependence of location detection and location recognition the outcomes for each may be initialized to a specified value and then an iterative approach may be applied to achieve location detection and location recognition together with assistance from one another.

At operation the location name identification module can propagate relevance scores to generate a search index . Once the location name and location sense disambiguation is completed relevance scores may be propagated among the remaining location senses within a document. These relevance scores can establish how relevant the location sense or location name is to the document. The relevance score may be used to establish search indices for the document.

At operation the location name identification module can support queries to the search index . A location query can identify which if any of the documents contain or relate to a location name according to the search index . The location query may originate from a user a search engine any other software module or any information retrieval mechanism. The routine can terminate after operation .

The computer architecture shown in illustrates a conventional desktop laptop or server computer and may be utilized to execute any aspects of the software components presented herein. It should be appreciated however that the described software components can also be executed on other example computing environments such as mobile devices television set top boxes kiosks vehicular information systems mobile telephones embedded systems or otherwise.

The mass storage device can be connected to the CPU through a mass storage controller not illustrated connected to the bus . The mass storage device and its associated computer readable media can provide non volatile storage for the computer .

In general software applications or modules such as those associated with the location name identification module may when loaded into the CPU and executed transform the CPU and the overall computer from general purpose computing systems into special purpose computing systems customized to perform location name identification. The CPU may be constructed from any number of transistors or other discrete circuit elements which may individually or collectively assume any number of states. More specifically the CPU may operate as one or more finite state machines in response to executable instructions contained within the software or modules. These computer executable instructions may transform the CPU by specifying how the CPU transitions between states thereby physically transforming the transistors or other discrete hardware elements constituting the CPU .

Encoding the software or modules onto the mass storage device may also transform the physical structure of the mass storage device or associated computer readable storage media.

For example if the computer readable storage media is implemented as semiconductor based memory the software or modules may transform the physical state of the semiconductor memory when the software is encoded therein. For example the software may transform the states of transistors capacitors or other discrete circuit elements constituting the semiconductor memory.

As another example the computer readable storage media may be implemented using magnetic or optical technology. In such implementations the software or modules may transform the physical state of magnetic or optical media when the software is encoded therein.
