title: Exact local computed tomography based on compressive sampling
abstract: A system and method for tomographic image reconstruction using truncated projection data that allows exact interior reconstruction (interior tomography) of a region of interest (ROI) based on the known sparsity models of the ROI, thereby improving image quality while reducing radiation dosage. In addition, the method includes parallel interior tomography using multiple sources beamed at multiple angles through an ROI and that enables higher temporal resolution.
