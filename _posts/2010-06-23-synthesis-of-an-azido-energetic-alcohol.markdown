This invention relates generally to the synthesis of an azido energetic alcohol and more particularly to the synthesis of 3 azido 2 2 dinitropropanol from 2 2 dinitropropane 1 3 diol.

Generally the field of energetic materials uses compounds composed of carbon hydrogen nitrogen and oxygen. These are typically arranged to form explosophoric functionality such as N nitro C nitro O nitro and azido.

Energetic materials containing the geminal dinitro groups C NO gem dinitro have generally low sensitivity to unplanned stimuli making them particularly valuable in the creation of munitions meeting Insensitive Munition IM requirements. Additionally these explosophores are attractive due to their high oxygen content and high energy.

A number of gem dinitro containing compounds have found application in the production of energetic materials. Typically these gem dinitro containing materials are prepared by conversion from a mononitroderivative with an active hydrogen using the silver nitrate method or the potassium ferricyanide method. Alternatively they may be prepared by functional group manipulation of an existing gem dinitro containing compound.

Geminal dinitro alcohols such as 2 2 dinitropropanol 2 2 dinitrobutanol and fluorodinitroethanol have the versatility to allow the preparation of a range of energetic plasticizers binders and oxidizers. For example 2 2 dinitropropanol is useful in the production of the energetic plasticizers bis 2 2 dinitropropyl formal BDNPF and bis 2 2 dinitropropylacetal BDNPA .

Although azide groups do not contribute to the oxygen balance of the compounds in which the azide group is contained organic azides can make an exceptional contribution to the heat of formation 75 95 kcal mol and the total energy released upon decomposition. Compounds containing both an azide and gem dinitro group can possess higher energy than the corresponding azido N compounds and thermal stability.

Displacement of leaving groups adjacent to gem dinitro moieties is known to be difficult due to inductive effects. Previous attempts to create 3 azido 2 2 dinitropropyl chloride by displacement of 1 3 dichloro 2 2 dinitropropane have been unsuccessful for at least this reason. The general approach of preparing 1 2 and 1 3 azido alcohols by displacement of an intermediate cyclic sulfate is well known in organic chemistry.

A versatile 1 azido 2 2 dinitro containing synthon can be used to create energetic ingredients containing the functionality described above. A gamma azido energetic alcohol can be formed by displacement of an intermediate cyclic sulfate. A gamma azido energetic alcohol is a versatile intermediate that allows for the potential preparation of a wide range of energetic ingredients including for example plasticizers binders and oxidizers. Inexpensive starting materials for example nitromethane and sodium azide can be used to synthesize a gamma azido energetic alcohol.

In one aspect the invention features a method of forming an azido energetic alcohol. The method includes converting an energetic diol to a cyclic sulfite oxidizing the cyclic sulfite to a cyclic sulfate and opening the cyclic sulfate to form a non cyclic sulfate. The non cyclic sulfate is hydrolyzed subsequent to opening to form an azido energetic alcohol.

In another aspect the invention features a method of forming an azido energetic alcohol. The method includes reacting thionyl chloride with an energetic diol to form a cyclic sulfite oxidizing the cyclic sulfite by a ruthenium catalyzed method to form a cyclic sulfate and reacting the cyclic sulfate with sodium azide followed by hydrolysis to form an azido energetic alcohol.

In some embodiments the energetic diol is 2 2 dinitropropane 1 3 diol. The cyclic sulfite can be 2 2 dinitro 1 3 propanediol sulfite. In some embodiments the cyclic sulfate is 2 2 dinitro 1 3 propanediol sulfate. The azido energetic alcohol can be a gamma azido energetic alcohol. The gamma azido energetic alcohol can be 3 azido 2 2 dinitropropanol.

In certain embodiments the hydrolyzer is sulfuric acid. The cyclic sulfate can be opened by reacting the cyclic sulfate with sodium azide.

In some embodiments the compound has peaks located at about 4.35 4 6 and 6.48 ppm in a H nuclear magnetic resonance NMR spectrum and peaks located at about 51 62 and 119 ppm is a C NMR spectrum.

Other aspects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following drawings and description all of which illustrate principles of the invention by way of example only.

Formula 1 a yellow oil that is soluble in organic solvents has peaks located at about 4.35 4.6 and 6.48 ppm in a H NMR spectrum and peaks located at about 51 62 and 119 ppm in a C NMR spectrum as discussed with reference to below. Formula 1 can be formed through a cyclic sulfate intermediate as shown in Scheme 1. Numerous ingredients and intermediates for the preparation of energetic compositions can be prepared using the compound of Formula 1. Functionalization of the terminal hydroxyl group of Formula 1 can provide functional handles for further elaboration for example sulfonation arylation alkylation nitration displacement or other transformation is possible. In addition the cluster of energetic groups in a relatively small area while maintaining the stability of the molecule further enhances the benefits of 3 azido 2 2 dinitropropanol.

In some embodiments substitution on the methylene carbons is possible. Formula 2 represents substitution on the methylene carbons. In Formula 2 either m or n can be at least one. In some embodiments both m and n are at least 1 and in some embodiments only one of m or n is at least 1.

In Formula 3 R can be a functionalized or unfunctionalized alkyl aryl or herteroaryl group. In some embodiments one R group is a hydrogen atom while the other R group is a functionalized or unfunctionalized alkyl aryl or herteroaryl group. The R groups can be the same or the R groups can be different. For example one R group could be an alkyl group while the other R group is an aryl group.

Forming 3 azido 2 2 dinitropropanol Formula 1 through a cyclic sulfate intermediate is advantageous because the reactions are relatively quick and require only mild conditions. For example 40 C. is the highest temperature that is used. In addition the reactions do not require anhydrous conditions. The yields for the first two steps of Scheme 1 are high. For example the yield can be greater than 80 . The overall yield of the product 3 azido 2 2 dinitropropanol can be greater than 60 when 2 2 dinitropropanediol is used as the starting material.

Referring to and Scheme 1 an azido energetic alcohol can be formed by converting an energetic diol to a cyclic sulfite step . As shown in Scheme 1 the energetic diol is 2 2 dinitropropane 1 3 diol and the cyclic sulfite is 2 2 dinitro 1 3 propanediol sulfite. The energetic diol is reacted with thionyl chloride to form the cyclic sulfite.

Next the cyclic sulfite can be oxidized to form a cyclic sulfate step . As shown in Scheme 1 the cyclic sulfate is 2 2 dinitro 1 3 propanedio sulfate. The cyclic sulfite is oxidized by a ruthenium catalyzed method to form a cyclic sulfate.

The cyclic sulfate can be opened step followed by hydrolysis to form an azido energetic alcohol. As shown in Scheme 1 the azido energetic alcohol is a gamma azido energetic alcohol. Also as shown in Scheme 1 the hydrolyzer is sulfuric acid. The hydrolyzer can be 20 sulfuric acid.

The cyclic sulfate can be opened by reacting the cyclic sulfate with sodium azide. The sulfate can be readily converted into a gamma azido energetic alcohol for example 3 azido 2 2 dinitropropanol by displacement with sodium azide followed by solvolysis.

Scheme 2 illustrates the conversion of nitromethane into 2 2 dinitro 1 3 propanediol cyclic sulfate. Nitromethane an inexpensive starting material can be converted to 2 2 dinitropropane 1 3 diol by first reacting the nitromethane with formaldehyde and sodium hydroxide and then adding sodium nitrite and silver nitrate. The conversion of 2 2 dinitropropane 1 3 diol to 2 2 dinitro 1 3 propanediol cyclic sulfate proceeds as illustrated in Scheme 2.

Scheme 3 illustrates the conversion of 2 2 dinitro 1 3 propanediol cyclic sulfate into 3 azido 2 2 dinitropropanol. First 2 2 dinitro 1 3 propanediol cyclic sulfate is reacted with sodium azide and dimethylformamide DMF to open the cyclic sulfate and form sodium 3 azido 2 2 dinitropropyl sulfate. After the cyclic sulfate is opened the sodium 3 azido 2 2 dinitropropyl sulfate is reacted with 20 sulfuric acid to form 3 azido 2 2 dinitropropanol.

The H NMR spectrum of shows the destruction of the symmetry that is present in the H NMR spectrum of . The single hydrogen atom of the OH group is represented by a single absorbance at about 6.48 ppm. The intensity of the absorbance is much less than the intensity of the absorbance of because the intensity of the absorbance represents one hydrogen atom while the intensity of the absorbance represents two hydrogen atoms.

The lack of symmetry of Alcohol B is better shown by comparing the hydrogen atoms of the two methyl groups. While all four hydrogen atoms of the two methyl groups of Diol A resulted in a single peak the four hydrogen atoms of Alcohol B result in two peaks. A first peak at an absorbance of about 4.6 represents the hydrogen atoms of the methyl group closest to the azide group while a second peak at an absorbance of about 4.35 represents the hydrogen atoms of the methyl group closest to the OH group. These two separate peaks represent the destruction of symmetry that is present in and also represent the formation of the desired end product 3 azido 2 2 dinitropropanol.

The loss of symmetry can be further demonstrated by comparing a C NMR spectrum of 2 2 dinitropropane 1 3 diol with a C NMR spectrum of 3 azido 2 2 dinitropropanol. Referring to the symmetry of the carbon atoms is shown. The center carbon atom is represented by a low intensity absorbance at about 119 ppm. The other two carbon atoms in Diol A are chemically equivalent and are represented by a single absorbance at about 60.0 ppm. shows three separate absorbance peaks which represent the three chemically distinct carbon atoms of 3 azido 2 2 dinitropropanol. Similar to absorbance of absorbance at about 117.5 ppm represents the center carbon atom of Alcohol B. However the other two carbon atoms are shown as distinct absorbance peaks because the two carbon atoms are not chemically equivalent. The carbon atom that is closest to the OH group is depicted by an absorbance peak at about 61.5 ppm. The carbon atom that is closest to the azide group is depicted by an absorbance peak at about 50.0 ppm. These two separate absorbance peaks instead of a single peak for example absorbance peak of represent the destruction of symmetry and the formation of the desired end product 3 azido 2 2 dinitropropanol.

2 2 dinitropropane 1 3 diol 35.8 g 215 mmol was suspended in dichloromethane DCM Anhydrous 200 mL in a 1 L 2 neck round bottom flask fitted with a condenser internal thermometer and magnetic stirring. The solution was warmed to reflux under argon and SOCl 1.3 eq. 279.5 mmol. 20.34 mL was added dropwise to the refluxing solution over 10 minutes. The faint yellow solution with trace solids was held at reflux for an additional 10 minutes and pyridine 2 mol 4.3 mmol 340 mg in 7 mL dry CHClwas added dropwise. After 2.5 hours at reflux the faintly yellow clear solution was cooled on ice and deionized HO 300 mL was added slowly with stirring. The organic layer was separated and washed with sat. NaHCO 200 mL followed by deionized HO 200 mL . After drying with sodium sulfate the solvent was removed under reduced pressure to provide a light tan solid 43 g . The crude product was dissolved in EtO 150 mL and hexane 150 mL was added. The solution was decanted away from trace orange solids that immediately precipitated. An additional portion of hexane 80 mL was added and the solution was slowly cooled to yield a total of 40.3 g 82 yield of off white crystals M.P. 37 39 C.

The cyclic sulfite from Example 1 40 g 0.189 mol was dissolved in CHCN 220 mL in a 1 L 3 neck flask with overhead stirring and internal thermometer. NaIO 1.5 eq. 283.5 mmol 60.6 g was added followed by dI HO 308 mL . The suspension was placed in a room temperature water bath and RuCl HO 0.01 eq. 1.89 mmol 426 mg was added. The suspension immediately turned brown and became thick with solids. A small exotherm pushed the reaction temperature up to 42 C. but the temperature rapidly dropped back down to 30 C. After stirring for 2 hours the solution was extracted with EtO 3 700 mL and washed with dI HO 500 mL followed by sat. NaHCO 500 mL dI HO 200 mL and finally brine 500 mL . The organics were dried with sodium sulfate and solvent was removed. The crude solids were crystallized from EtO hexanes to provide the product as bright white crystals 40 g 175 mmol 93 having a melting temperature between 63 66 C.

The cyclic sulfate produced in Example 2 20 g 87.6 mmol was dissolved in DMF Anhydrous 200 mL in a 500 mL round bottomed flask with internal thermometer and magnetic stirring. The flask was submerged in a room temperature water bath and NaN 1.1 eq. 96.4 mmol 6.26 g was added.

After 1.75 hours the majority of the solvent was removed from the clear yellow solution under reduced pressure. The white semisolid that resulted totaled 45 g including residual DMF.

The crude material from the previous step was cooled in an ice bath and 100 mL of 20 HSOwas added. The solution was stirred in the ice bath for 5 minutes and warmed to room temperature and then 30 C. The product was isolated in crops by extraction with EtO and the pooled organics were dried with sodium sulfate. After removal of solvent the product was isolated in pure form as a yellow oil 14 g 73.3 mmol in 84 yield.

Based on the H NMR C NMR and FT IR data collected it is believed that Alcohol B was formed from Diol A in an efficient manner through a cyclic sulfate intermediate. By crystallization of the intermediate sulfite and sulfate purification of the final Alcohol B product is unnecessary. Overall yields by this process are in excess of 60 for 2 2 dinitropropanediol.
