These as well as other aspects advantages and alternatives will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art by reading the following detailed description with reference where appropriate to the accompanying drawings.

The present invention comprises a management system method and program product for managing redemptions and in some embodiments creations for a collective investment vehicle with the system method and program product configured with a true up operation.

As noted collective asset vehicles comprise any entity that allows investors to pool their money and invest the pooled funds rather than buying securities directly. A collective investment vehicle may be rigidly structured as in an asset backed security or it may be more basic like a stock or bond. An investment vehicle may involve the purchase of a debt obligation with entitlement to repayment with interest or it may involve buying an ownership stake in a business with the hope that the business will become profitable. An example of a collective investment vehicle is an exchange traded fund ETF . Another example is mutual fund.

As noted the invention will be described in relation to a market participant MP which is any person or entity that wants to create or redeem shares in the collective investment vehicle.

Note that in one embodiment the AP representative is a broker and the agreement with the AP representative imposes a confidentiality restriction on the AP representative that requires that all or a portion of the first set of assets not be disclosed to the AP and or anyone else for some period of time e.g. 1 day 2 days a week for example including permanently.

In another embodiment the agreement with the AP representative may impose requirements on liquidation timing for some or all of the first set of assets such as that all or a portion of stock shares in the first set of assets be liquidated among a given number of brokers anonymously within a given time period after first disclosure of the first set of assets to the AP representative. The AP representative may also be required by agreement to liquidate only designated securities or security types. Additionally the requirement for liquidation may include a another timing requirement e.g. only a portion of the assets may be liquidated immediately and there must be a delay or several delays to liquidate the other portions of the remainder of the assets. Additionally in one embodiment the agreement with the AP representative may include a restriction on the markets used for the liquidation e.g. only a portion of the assets to be liquidated or only certain types of securities or designated securities may be sold in a given market. In an embodiment the underlying securities and other assets in the portfolio may not be confidential but the identity of the assets being liquidated will be held confidential for some period of time including permanently.

As noted an example of a collective investment vehicle is an exchange traded fund ETF . Creation and redemption mechanisms for an Exchange Traded Fund ETF are described below as one example of the present invention in relation to collective investment vehicles. The creation and redemption mechanisms in one embodiment for an actively traded ETF comprise computer systems and methods for an authorized participant AP or other MP to create ETF shares without an AP directly delivering the portfolio securities to the ETF and to redeem ETF shares without the AP learning the identity of an underlying portfolio securities of the ETF at least for some period of time or in some embodiments permanently. The creation and redemption mechanisms may involve in one embodiment the use of a blind trust power of attorney agency or bailment agreement or any other mechanism that withholds the identity of the portfolio securities from the AP or other MP.

In one embodiment a method of administering an ETF comprises a method of creating shares in the ETF. In one embodiment the AP may provide the ETF with cash which is referred to as a cash creation. The amount of cash required may be determined in response to a number of ETF shares requested for creation and the net asset value of the ETF s assets e.g. the value of an ETF share. In an alternative embodiment the method comprises appointing or having appointed a respective authorized participant representative AP representative to act on behalf of a respective AP for purposes of creating shares in the ETF. In this embodiment when an AP initiates creation of ETF shares it may deposit cash with it respective AP representative with instructions to provide the cash to the ETF to create the ETF shares. Alternatively the AP may provide instructions to the AP representative to buy and or borrow necessary portfolio securities to deliver to the ETF a creation basket of securities. In this embodiment the ETF provides to the AP representative confidential data records containing information regarding desired contents of the creation basket. In embodiments where the securities are borrowed the AP representative is authorized to pay an appropriate fee to the entity that loaned the securities. To complete the creation ETF shares may be electronically transferred directly to an electronic account of the AP or may be electronically transferred to the AP via an electronic account of the AP representative.

In particular in one embodiment creations may be performed by an AP representative electronically receiving confidential creation basket data records specifying a desired basket of portfolio securities for a creation event the AP representative obtaining the desired basket of portfolio securities the AP representative electronically transferring the desired basket of portfolio securities to the ETF wherein the AP does not have access to the confidential creation basket data records specifying the desired basket of portfolio securities.

In an additional embodiment the method of administering the ETF includes a method of redeeming shares in the ETF. In this embodiment an AP may redeem ETF shares by providing the ETF with the ETF shares directly or may provide them to the ETF via the AP representative. To complete the redemption the ETF will deliver portfolio securities to the AP representative who will then sell or otherwise liquidate those securities on the open market or return them if borrowed on behalf of the AP without disclosing their identity to the AP and remit the cash proceeds to the AP.

In one embodiment the method of redeeming shares of an ETF comprises providing a request to redeem ETF shares an AP representative electronically receiving portfolio securities from the ETF as a result of a redemption of ETF shares while ensuring that the identity of the portfolio securities is not disclosed to the AP the AP representative obtaining transferable assets in exchange for the portfolio securities and providing the transferable assets to the AP.

In another embodiment redemptions may comprise receiving a request to redeem ETF shares identifying a redemption basket of portfolio securities and electronically transferring the redemption basket of portfolio securities to an AP representative as part of a redemption of ETF shares while ensuring that the identity of the redemption basket of portfolio securities is not disclosed to the AP.

In one embodiment a relationship with an AP representative or MP representative for other example embodiments may be established by the AP as part of an agreement between and AP and the ETF and this agreement in one embodiment may comprise an exhibit to an ETF registration statement filed with SEC. The AP representative may be selected by the ETF or at least approved by ETF as set out in the ETF AP agreement. The actions of the AP representative are governed by instructions according to the ETF AP agreement which may be reflected in a direct agreement with the AP representative with the instructions requiring that the identity of the underlying portfolio securities not be disclosed to the AP. In one embodiment an instruction may be included requiring the AP representative to liquidate all or a substantial portion of securities received from the ETF in a redemption event in order to maintain the identities of the securities identified for the redemption confidential with respect to the AP. Additionally the receipt of the underlying portfolio securities by the AP representative e.g. into the blind trust is part of a like kind exchange of ETF shares for the delivered underlying portfolio securities between an AP and an ETF.

In one embodiment the ETF or other collective investment vehicle disseminates or has disseminated an intraday indicative value IIV of the ETF by providing the contents of its portfolio to a pricing service pursuant to the terms of a confidentiality agreement. In another embodiment the portfolio is divided among two or more pricing services such that neither pricing service knows the identity of the entire portfolio. In this embodiment the ETF or listing exchange or an agent of either uses the received prices to calculate the intraday indicative value for public dissemination.

In one embodiment the IIV is determined by electronically transmitting a plurality of partial position data records containing partial position information to a plurality of pricing agents electronically receiving partial pricing data automatically computing an IIV and electronically publishing the IIV via a data communication feed. The methods may be performed using a computer readable storage medium having stored therein instructions to cause a microprocessor to electronically receive partial pricing data and automatically compute an IIV and electronically transmit the IIV via a data communication feed. The computer readable storage medium may also include instructions to transmit a plurality of partial position data records containing partial position information to a plurality of pricing agents. In one embodiment the pricing data from the multiple pricing agents is received by the ETF or other collective investment vehicle or is received by a consolidator on behalf of the ETF or other collective investment vehicle and an IIV is calculated and transmitted electronically for dissemination to the market.

With reference to an embodiment of system and method of administering an exchange traded fund ETF is described. While the methods and systems described herein may be used for any type of ETF or other collective investment vehicle they are particularly beneficial in conjunction with actively managed ETFs or other actively managed collective investment vehicles such as closed end funds as well as for proprietary indexes. An ETF may engage in market transactions with markets . Customers and an agent or AP representative may also engage in market transactions respectively. The authorized participant AP interacts with the ETF either directly as shown by transaction or via the AP representative as shown by transactions . The AP may buy from and sell ETF shares for customers as shown by transaction or in the market as shown by transaction .

The transactions described herein involve the transfer of securities between various entities such as the ETF the AP and the AP representative. It should be understood that the transfer of such securities is preferably performed electronically via suitable messaging formats and computer systems. For example in one embodiment the DTC Depository Trust Company or other suitable universal clearing service provides a participant terminal system for transferring securities using electronic messaging. Thus an electronic transfer of securities may be performed by sending an electronic message to the DTC. The DTC then performs a book entry movement by executing an accounting entry to move securities from one account to another account.

One aspect of an ETF is a calculation and reporting of the intraday indicative value or IIV. In order to maintain the confidentiality of the holdings of the managed ETF the ETF may provide partial position information to a plurality of pricing agents such as pricing agent A and pricing agent B . The pricing agents then provide partial pricing data to an IIV consolidator . The IIV consolidator consolidates the partial pricing data into an IIV and provides the ETF IIV to customers and to markets generally . By using a plurality of pricing agents the ETF manager is able to maintain the confidentiality of the precise makeup of the ETF .

Note that in one embodiment the ETF or other collective investment vehicle may not need to require confidentiality of the IIV calculation. Such an embodiment would occur where the securities in the underlying funds are not maintained in confidence but the AP representative or MP representative is used to maintain the identity and quantity of securities traded by the ETF or collective investment vehicle for e.g. 1 hour 6 hours 1 day 2 days 1 week to name a few including permanently.

The ETF or collective investment vehicle may be for example an actively managed fund wherein the ETF or collective investment vehicle manager engages in transactions in the market as indicated by arrow in order to alter the contents or holdings of the ETF or other collective investment vehicle . The ETF or other collective investment vehicle manager may also or alternatively alter the holdings of the ETF or collective investment vehicle through a series of creation and redemption events as described herein.

The AP or MP may be in one embodiment a bank broker dealer exchange specialist market maker arbitrageur exchange or an investor. The AP or other MP may enter into an agreement with the ETF or other collective investment vehicle setting the terms for the creation and redemption of the ETF s or other collective investment vehicle shares. In one embodiment creations and redemptions may be required to be in creation unit or redemption unit aggregations. In another embodiment the creations and redemptions may not require creation and or redemption aggregation units. In one embodiment a representative relationship such as via a blind trust or other agency vehicle is established by the AP or other MP as part of the agreement between and AP or other MP and the ETF or other collective investment vehicle. The actions of the AP representative or other MP representative e.g. trustee of the blind trust agent etc. are governed by instructions specified or agreed or approved by the ETF or other collective investment vehicle and the instructions require that the identities of the underlying securities are not disclosed to the AP and that all or a substantial portion of the delivered securities are liquidated so that the AP or MP does not learn the identity of a substantial number of the securities in the portfolio of the ETF or other collective investment vehicle for at least some period of time or indefinitely.

With reference to a computer system or system networked computers may be used to implement various transactions and data transfers associated with operation of the ETF or other collective investment vehicle described herein. The system may include an AP or MP workstation AP representative or MP representative workstation and ETF or other collective investment vehicle system which in one embodiment includes server a database which contains information relating to the ETF or other collective investment vehicle portfolio securities and creation and redemption basket data and database which contains data relating to the APs and AP representatives and or MP s and MP representatives such as identification information password files encryption keys other access authorization and accounting AAA data. In this regard ETF or other collective investment vehicle system may optionally include AAA server and a security gateway . The various components communicate over network which may be a public network such as the Internet or a private network including leased lines or a virtual private network using virtual private network VPN protocols.

The various transactions and transfers described herein in one embodiment takes place using the systems and components shown in although one of skill in the art will appreciate that many variations of the system may be implemented without departing from the scope of the invention. Suitable networking protocols may be used including the Transport Control Protocol Internet Protocol TCP IP suite of protocols and also including the HyperText Transport Protocol HTTP and associated security protocols HTTPS and other mechanisms such as Virtual Private Networking VPN Secure Sockets Layer SSL Transport Layer Security TLS tunneling protocols such as Generic Routing and Encapsulation GRE Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol L2TP and the like. Another protocol that may be used to facilitate the transactions and associated messaging described herein is the Financial Information eXchange FIX Protocol which is a messaging standard developed specifically for the real time electronic exchange of securities transactions. FIX is a public domain specification owned and maintained by FIX Protocol Ltd. In addition some of the transactions may be communicated in a manual fashion such as via telephone or textual messaging email and the like whereupon the relevant transaction information may be keyed or otherwise entered into the appropriate computer systems.

In one embodiment the AP or MP representative electronically receives confidential creation basket data records specifying a desired basket of securities for a creation event or obtains this information by accessing a website or other Internet portal for the ETF or other collective investment vehicle. Creation basket data records may be automatically created in response to an ETF manager identifying securities for the creation basket. The system then creates one or more confidential creation basket data records specifying a desired basket of securities for a creation event. In one embodiment the ETF or other collective investment vehicle manager accesses a portfolio management interface associated with server that allows the manager to identify the creation baskets. The interface allows the ETF or other collective investment vehicle manager to prioritize the order in which different creation baskets are used when performing a series of creation events. In addition the interface to server allows designation of creation baskets in advance of any actual creation notifications. System then electronically transfers the confidential creation basket data records to the AP or MP representative system upon request while ensuring that the identity of the redemption basket of portfolio securities is not disclosed to the AP or MP for at least some period of time including permanently.

The systems described above may include computer readable storage media for use with computer systems to effectuate certain steps described herein. In particular the computer readable media may contain instructions to cause a microprocessor to execute the following steps receiving a request to create ETF shares and transmitting confidential creation basket data records specifying a desired basket of securities for a creation event.

While maintaining the information in confidence and not disclosing the information to the AP the AP representative acquires the desired portfolio securities. In one embodiment the AP representative obtains the desired portfolio securities via market as shown by transaction . In an alternative embodiment the AP representative may obtain the underlying securities for the creation basket by borrowing some or all of the desired basket of securities. The AP representative then provides the desired creation basket to ETF as shown by transaction . The ETF then delivers shares of the ETF to the AP representative as shown by transaction . In one embodiment the AP representative electronically transfers the desired basket of securities to the ETF. That is transaction may be performed by sending an electronic message to the DTC or other universal clearing service with instructions to make a book transfer of the desired securities to an electronic account of the ETF . AP representative then provides the ETF shares to an electronic account of the AP as shown by transaction .

Information may take the form of a confidential portfolio composition file provided only to AP representatives or MP representatives for purposes of creation events. The ETF may formulate unique composition files reflecting the ETF manager s desired acquisitions. The data may take the form of a plurality of confidential creation basket data records specifying a desired basket of securities for a creation event. The acquisitions thus effectuated via creation events together with the elimination or removal of specific underlying security assets via redemptions allow the ETF manager to adjust or alter the portfolio composition without purchasing or selling securities directly.

As shown in one method of performing a redemption comprises the AP or MP providing ETF or other collective investment vehicle shares to the actively managed ETF or other collective investment vehicle in transaction or via the AP representative or MP representative . In exchange for the receipt of ETF or other collective investment shares ETF or other collective investment vehicle provides a basket of portfolio securities to the AP representative or MP representative as shown by transaction . Transaction may be performed by the AP or MP sending a message to the DTC or other universal clearing service to transfer ETF or other collective investment vehicle shares to the electronic account of the ETF or other collective investment vehicle. Transaction may comprise the ETF or other collective investment vehicle sending a message to the DTC or other universal clearing service to transfer particular portfolio securities to the electronic account of the AP representative or the MP representative .

As noted the selection of the underlying securities may be made by the ETF manager so as to alter or adjust the holdings of the ETF . In one embodiment low cost basis securities held in the ETF portfolio may be provided so as to retain only higher cost basis securities or only low cost basis securities or a mix thereof or based on one or more objectives of the fund manager. The AP representative then liquidates the portfolio securities through market transactions or other transactions . The AP representative is then able to provide the AP with cash or other suitable instrument as shown by transaction . Note that although ETF provides the portfolio securities to AP representative the portfolio securities are assets rightfully belonging to AP .

Note that although the embodiments described comprise one or more agreement provisions requiring the AP representative or MP representative to maintain the confidentiality of the identity of the portfolio securities provided to the AP representative or MP representative by ETF or other collective investment vehicle some embodiments may use an AP representative without this requirement.

With reference to an alternative method of performing a redemption event is described. AP may provide AP representative with an amount of ETF shares or a sufficient amount of cash in transaction . The AP representative may then use the ETF shares or buy ETF shares using the cash and provide the shares to ETF in transaction preferably performed via a DTC transfer message to authorize an electronic transfer between accounts. ETF provides a basket of portfolio securities to AP representative as shown by transaction via a DTC transfer message. Again the identity of the basket of portfolio securities is held in confidence by AP representative for at least some period of time and such information is not provided to AP or to any other individual or entity that is not obligated to maintain its confidentiality. The AP representative then liquidates the portfolio securities preferably using the market as shown by transaction . The AP representative then provides to the customer via the AP cash or other suitable instruments as shown by transaction .

From the perspective of the ETF the system receives a request to redeem ETF shares. The request may come directly from the AP computer system or via the AP representative system . Alternatively the request may be communicated to system via alternative communication methods including phone fax email etc. and the information keyed into the system. The ETF system then identifies a redemption basket of portfolio securities. This is preferably performed by an ETF manager who creates one or more confidential redemption basket data records specifying a desired basket of securities for a redemption event. In one embodiment the ETF manager accesses a portfolio management computer interface associated with ETF server that allows the manager to identify the securities for the redemption baskets. The interface in one embodiment allows the ETF manager to prioritize the order in which the redemption baskets are used when performing redemption events. In addition the interface to the ETF server allows designation of redemption baskets in advance of any actual redemption notifications. System then electronically transfers the redemption basket of portfolio securities to an electronic account of the AP representative system to ensure that the identity of the redemption basket of portfolio securities is not disclosed to the AP for at least some period of time including permanently.

With reference to a method of performing a creation event is illustrated. The AP may establish a relationship with an AP representative such as by a blind trust agreement power of attorney agency agreement or bailment or other suitable agency vehicle. The AP may provide the AP representative with cash the cash being a value equivalent of a creation basket. At step the AP representative may be given confidential information from the ETF regarding a desired basket of portfolio securities for the creation event. The AP representative may then obtain the portfolio securities at step and then engage in a like kind exchange of the portfolio securities for ETF shares with the ETF at step . For a creation basket the AP representative may obtain the underlying securities on the open market using the cash. Alternatively the AP representative may borrow the underlying securities from another entity. The AP representative is authorized to pay an appropriate fee to the entity that loaned the underlying securities. The determination of whether to buy or borrow the portfolio securities may be based on the representative relationship agreement and may be based on relative costs of engaging in the transactions on behalf of the AP. At step the ETF shares are provided to the AP thereby allowing the AP to sell the ETF shares in the market. The ETF shares may be provided directly to the AP from the ETF or may pass through the AP representative.

With reference to a method of administering an ETF is described. Method comprises requiring appointment of an AP representative to represent the AP at least for redemptions of ETF shares. This step may be implemented by the ETF appointing an AP representative at step or requiring appointment of an AP representative. A requirement for an AP representative may comprise the ETF requiring the clearing system that facilitates transfer of the ETF shares e.g. the DTC to only accept redemptions and or creations for its ETF shares from AP s represented by respective AP representatives or to only accept order transfer communications on forms that automatically set up an AP representative. In one embodiment the ETF may enter into an agreement with the AP to appoint an AP representative. In another embodiment a purchase of a share of the ETF may automatically appoint an AP representative. In another embodiment the ETF may have a right of approval of the AP representative or other input into the selection of the AP representative and may specify specific provisions on confidentiality and liquidation. The method of imposing this requirement of an AP representative is not limiting on the invention.

The AP representative takes actions on behalf of the AP but as noted is precluded by the agreement from disclosing or taking actions that would result in disclosure of the securities of the ETF portfolio to the AP for at least some period of time including permanently. In method the AP representative receives the portfolio securities from the ETF at step . In the case where a blind trust is used the beneficiary of the blind trust is the AP associated with the ETF. The trust is a blind trust because the trustee manages the assets of the trust and acts on behalf of the AP or MP beneficiary without disclosing the identity of the trust assets the portfolio securities exchanged with the ETF to the AP for some period of time including permanently but the AP directs the occurrence of the buy and sell events. At step the AP representative liquidates the portfolio securities identified for the redemption in a manner that ensures that the identity of the securities in the redemption is not disclosed to the AP or the market for some period of time including permanently. The AP representative may liquidate the portfolio securities by selling them in the market and the AP representative then provides the funds resulting from the sale to the AP. Alternatively the trustee may obtain other transferable assets and provide them to the AP. A

As noted previously the examples of apply equally to collective investment vehicles MP s and MP representatives.

In some embodiments the basket of securities selected for delivery to the AP or the MP representative may be made up of a proportionate share of all the securities held by the ETF or other collective investment vehicle. Alternatively the basket composition may be determined at the discretion of the ETF or other collective investment vehicle manager. In this way the manager may selectively reduce the fund s holdings in one or more particular securities. In some embodiments it may be desirable to place some limitations on the basket of portfolio securities provided to the AP or the MP representative. Primarily any such limitations or restrictions are intended to ensure that the selection of the portfolio securities delivered during a redemption does not place an undue burden on the AP or the MP representative. In this regard the manager may be required to ensure that the basket does not include an undue concentration of any particular security. The concentration of any security may be specified as a percentage of the overall value of the basket. Alternatively the basket may be restricted based in part on the relative liquidity of the securities. That is the quantity of any particular security in the redemption basket may be limited by a percentage of the average daily trading volume of that security. In one embodiment the server includes a software module to ensure the redemption baskets comply with the necessary restrictions.

Redemption events include providing the ETF or other collective investment vehicle with the fund s shares in exchange for the portfolio securities. While the AP or the MP representative in actively managed ETF or other collective investment vehicle embodiments receives the portfolio securities from the ETF or other collective investment vehicle during redemption the fund shares may be provided directly to the ETF or other collective investment vehicle by the AP or the MP. Alternatively the AP or MP may first provide the AP or MP representative with the shares of the ETF or other collective investment vehicle thereby allowing the AP or MP representative to provide the fund shares to the ETF or other collective investment vehicle as part of a redemption event.

A further aspect of the ETF or other collective investment vehicle operation is the calculation and reporting of the intraday indicative value or IIV. The IIV may also be referred to as the underlying trading value indicative portfolio value or the like. In one embodiment the collective investment vehicle may itself calculate the IIV and provide the IIV to a service for publication. In another embodiment the collective investment vehicle may contract with a service to calculate the IIV on its behalf and provide the IIV for publication. In one embodiment in order to maintain the confidentiality of the holdings of a managed ETF or other collective investment vehicle the ETF or other collective investment vehicle may provide partial position information to a plurality of pricing agents such as pricing agent and pricing agent . Preferably a plurality of partial position data records containing partial position information is electronically transmitted to a plurality of pricing agents. The partial position information includes security identifiers and in some embodiments corresponding quantity information for different subsets of the portfolio holdings for different pricing agents. The partial position information may also include some erroneous stock identifiers and or the ETF or other collective investment vehicle may maintain a token number of a variety of securities in order to further mask the exact makeup of the ETF or other collective investment vehicle holdings. The pricing agents then provide partial pricing data to the intraday indicative value IIV consolidator . Preferably the consolidator electronically receives the partial pricing data. The partial pricing data is preferably the value of the partial positions. The IIV consolidator may then combine the partial pricing data into a composite consolidated price or preferably using a secure server for automatically computing an intraday indicative value IIV . In the event that erroneous stock identifiers and positions were included in the partial position information these values are subtracted by the IIV consolidator during the calculation.

Alternatively the IIV consolidator may be the ETF or other collective investment vehicle custodian or another entity that has authorized access to the confidential identity of the holdings of the managed ETF or other collective investment vehicle and may compute the pricing information directly without the use of a pricing agent. The IIV consolidator provides ETF or other collective investment vehicle quotes to customer and to markets generally by electronically publishing the IIV via a data communication feed. By using a plurality of pricing agents the ETF or other collective investment vehicle manager is able to maintain the confidentiality of the precise makeup of the ETF or other collective investment vehicle . Methods of performing the IIV calculation and consolidation are disclosed in application Ser. No. 11 838 681 filed on Aug. 14 2007. This application is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for the purpose of combining embodiments disclosed therein with the disclosure herein and for all other purposes.

Referring to one embodiment of a system method and program product for administering a collective investment vehicle with a portfolio of securities in relation to one or more market participants MP s is illustrated. As noted above such a collective investment vehicle may comprise by way of example but not by way of limitation an exchange traded fund ETF or a mutual fund. With reference to block comprises an operation of performing a creation event for a collective investment vehicle. The creation event would comprise an operation of receiving a request to create shares of the collective investment vehicle receiving an asset from one of the MP s or on its behalf in relation to the creation event. The asset may comprise anything of value for which the MP would be willing to issue shares of its fund. In one embodiment the asset received may comprise one or more securities for a creation basket in an account transfer from or on behalf of the one MP and or cash from or on behalf of the one MP or a combination thereof. Note that the use of the word comprising is always intended to be open ended. The collective investment vehicle manager would then issue shares directly or indirectly to the respective one MP based on the asset received. In one embodiment the fund shares are transferred to the MP by sending an electronic message by one or more computers and an electronic network to a clearing agency e.g. the DTC to provide fund shares of the collective investment vehicle to an electronic account for the MP or the electronic account of the MP representative. As noted previously the fund share creation may be accomplished by the DTC or other clearing entity performing a book entry movement by executing an accounting entry to move or create securities for account.

Block of comprises an operation of obtaining securities for the collective investment vehicle to become a part of the portfolio of securities. This operation may be performed manually or electronically. For example securities for the collective investment vehicle may be obtained by the collective investment vehicle receiving into its electronic account the securities. As noted this may occur when the DTC or other clearing entity performs a book entry movement by executing an accounting entry to move securities from an account of a securities owner account to the account for the collective investment vehicle. The method of obtaining the securities is not limiting on the invention.

Block of comprises an operation of obtaining or creating an electronic record of security identifiers for the portfolio of securities held by the collective investment vehicle. This operation may comprise receiving an data keyed into a computer interface or receiving data from a network to name a few. The method of obtaining the electronic record of the security identifiers is not limiting on the invention.

Block of comprises an operation of calculating and disseminating automatically an intraday indicative value IIV by one or more computers programmed to calculate the IIV with the calculating based on or derived from the electronic record of the portfolio of securities in the collective investment vehicle or transmitting data electronically by the one or more computers of contents of the portfolio of securities to one or more third parties for a calculation and dissemination of the IIV. Note that the operation of calculating is intended to encompass having the IIV calculated on behalf of the collective investment vehicle by one or more third parties for dissemination. Examples of such third party calculation for a confidential portfolio have been previously disclosed using one or more pricing agents and a consolidator.

Blocks of comprise an operation of performing a redemption event. Block comprises an operation of receiving a request to redeem shares of the collective investment vehicle for a given MP with the request to redeem shares comprising a number of shares to redeem or a value specifying parameter. In one embodiment the request may be received by one or more computers of the system via an electronic communication network. Alternatively the request may be received by facsimile or by telephone or by letter to name a few and the data from the request keyed into the system computers. In the case of a request to redeem a number of shares the request may include a specific number e.g. 1000 shares to be redeemed. Examples of such requests and the calculations operations to process the redemption of a specific number of shares are provided below. Alternatively or in addition the request to redeem shares of the collective investment vehicle may comprise a value specifying parameter for at least approximating a number of shares to be redeemed. For example the communication may request a redemption of 100 000 worth of shares. Note that this is a number that approximates a number of shares for redemption. The actual number of shares to be redeemed will be determined based on a price of a share of the collective investment vehicle determined by a prescribed valuation algorithm for a given strike time examples of which are described below. The calculation entailed by receipt of such a value specifying parameter in one embodiment comprises dividing 100 000 by the determined share price a the strike time. This share number calculation will in many cases result in a whole number of shares plus a fractional share. In many exchange system embodiments fractional shares are not traded. Thus for the 100 000 redemption example shares equal to only 99 500 may be redeemed with a 500 fractional share remaining which is not traded. This is described in an example below. However this system will operate equally well in exchanges that do trade fractional shares of the collective investment vehicle.

Block in comprises an operation of determining a distribution value of assets for a distribution event based on the number of shares to redeem or based on the number of shares determined from the value specifying parameter or the value specifying parameter itself. In one implementation this determining operation comprises calculating by one or more computers a distribution value of assets for the distribution event. By way of example if 1000 shares are requested to be redeemed in the redemption request or are determined based on the value specifying parameter then 1000 is multiplied by an estimated value of a share of the collective investment vehicle determined using a valuation algorithm. The valuation algorithm may be pre determined or may be determined at the time of the redemption request. The determination or the pre determination of the valuation algorithm may be made by the manager of the collective investment vehicle or made by the MP making the redemption request or his her agent or representative or it may be pre determined based on an agreement between the collective investment vehicle and the MP making the redemption request or his her agent or representative or by other agreement.

The algorithm used to determine the share value of the collective investment vehicle may be simply to use the then current value of the share in the market at a time of the receipt of the redemption request or at a prescribed time on a given day e.g. 3 30 pm on the day of receipt of the request. Alternatively it may be an estimate of the share value at the market close or at a given time based on one or more share value projection algorithms. Non limiting examples of other algorithms that may be used to calculate the value of the shares to be redeemed at a given time are a last sale price for an asset quotation information such as a bid price offer price or median or other point between the bid price and the offer price for the asset or an algorithm based calculation based on VWAP value weighted average price or an algorithm based calculation based on PWAP price weighted average price of the shares of the asset or an algorithm based calculation based on a straight average price of the shares of the asset traded over the course of a period of time or an algorithm based calculation based on an average of a share price of the asset traded over the course of a period of time but excluding a last trade or excluding the highest and or lowest share price among others. These examples name just a few of the possible prescribed algorithms that may be used to perform this calculation.

Note that the distribution value calculation of block is performed at a different time from a calculation of the value of the shares of the collective investment vehicle made for purposes of determining a true up amount to be discussed below. Regarding the timing of the calculation in one embodiment the calculation is made at a time the request to redeem is received. In another embodiment the calculation is performed at a later time such as 3 30 pm.

In the case where the redemption request comprises a value specifying parameter the determination of block may simply comprise taking the value specifying parameter from the redemption request and designating using that value as the distribution value. This is the case where the value specifying parameter is simply a currency value in a redemption instruction e.g. Please redeem 100 000 of shares of the collective investment vehicle. Alternatively a calculation by one or more computers may be performed if the value specifying parameter is not directly usable as the distribution value such as if the value specifying parameter is in currency that is not usable by the collective investment vehicle or is in some other form not directly useable. The algorithm for converting this value specifying parameter to a distribution value is not limiting on the invention.

Block comprises an operation of determining based at least in part on the distribution value of block a first set of one or more assets to distribute for the distribution event comprising commodities or securities e.g. equities bonds to name a few or legal instruments or comprising at least two selected from a group of cash commodities securities or other legal instruments.

Note that the assets chosen to cover the distribution value may comprise a slice that reflects the composition of the assets making up the collective investment vehicle. Alternatively the assets chosen may reflect an investment strategy of a manager of the collective investment vehicle. For example for an actively traded collective investment vehicle the manager may decide that he she wants to reduce or eliminate his her position in a particular asset or set of assets. Thus the first set of assets to distribute may comprise shares of just one asset or shares of just two assets to be reduced or eliminated from the collective investment vehicle. In one embodiment the number of shares of the one or more assets and the mix of assets to be distributed for the redemption is determined by computer based at least in part on the number of shares set forth in the request to redeem or on the value specifying parameter set forth in the request to redeem. Another criterion that may be used to select the first set of assets for the distribution comprises a gain or loss that will be realized from a sale or transfer of particular lots of the given asset if included in the first set of assets for distribution.

Block comprises the operation of communicating before a strike time an identification of the first set of one or more assets to distribute including a number of each one of the assets to a market participant representative MP representative acting on behalf of the given MP for which the collective investment vehicle shares were received which MP representative is governed by an agreement imposing a restriction on liquidation and disclosure of the first set of assets. To facilitate this operation a requirement is made to establish the respective MP representative to act for the respective given MP in at least one or more redemption events with the collective investment vehicle subject to terms that govern the actions of the MP representative and at least requires a confidentiality restriction regarding an identity of all or a portion of the first set of one or more assets with respect to the MP and a liquidation parameter for all or a portion of the first set of one or more assets. As noted previously for the AP representative the particular method of imposing the requirement to appoint an MP representative to represent the MP at least for redemptions of collective investment vehicle shares is not limiting on the invention. This step may be implemented by the collective investment vehicle appointing an MP representative or requiring appointment of an MP representative. A requirement for an MP representative may comprise the collective investment vehicle requiring the clearing system that facilitates transfer of the collective investment vehicle shares e.g. the DTC to only accept redemptions and or creations for its collective investment vehicle shares from MP s represented by respective MP representatives or to only accept order transfer communications on forms that automatically set up an MP representative. In one embodiment the collective investment vehicle may enter into an agreement with the MP to appoint an MP representative. In another embodiment a purchase of a share of the collective investment vehicle may automatically appoint an MP representative. In another embodiment the collective investment vehicle may have a right of approval of the MP representative or other input into the selection of the MP representative and may specify specific provisions on confidentiality and liquidation.

The purpose of this communication is to permit the MP or its representative to transform a different set of assets in the marketplace. In one embodiment this communication takes place in advance of an actual delivery of the first set of assets thereto. For example the actual distribution of the first set of assets to the account of the MP or its representative may take place the same day T 0 the next day T 1 two days later T 2 three day later T 3 or at some other time. This advance notification allows the MP or its representative to sell or place contracts to sell one or more of the first set of assets in advance of the actual delivery of the first set of assets. In one embodiment this communication operation is performed electronically by telephone by email Fax by cell phone text messaging or other convenient communication method. As an example the communication may be implemented by Push software at a server on behalf of the manager of the collective investment vehicle in response to an input of a number of shares to be redeemed into a graphical user interface provided by the server of the collective investment vehicle.

Block comprises a computer implemented operation of calculating by the one or more computers a value of the first set of assets as of a strike time based on price data valid as of the strike time. Note that the result of this calculation will be used in a true up calculation to be discussed below for block and the strike time is the time that is agreed for the true up valuation. The strike time may be a market close time for the day the redemption request was received. Alternatively the strike time may be a different time determined by the manager of the collective investment vehicle or the MP or representative of the collective investment vehicle or by agreement. The algorithm used for the calculation may be a last sale price for an asset quotation information such as a bid price offer price or median or other point between the bid price and the offer price for the asset or an algorithm based calculation based on VWAP value weighted average price i.e. a number of shares traded for a given asset used to weight the price for the shares or an algorithm based calculation based on PWAP price weighted average price of the shares of the asset or an algorithm based calculation based on a straight average price of the shares of the asset traded over the course of a period of time or an algorithm based calculation based on an average of the price of a share of the asset traded over the course of a period of time but excluding a last trade or excluding the highest and or lowest share price to name a few.

Block comprises a computer implemented operation of calculating by the one or more computers either a monetary value as of the strike time of the number of shares requested to be redeemed or a monetary value as of the strike time of a number of shares approximated by the value specifying parameter. Note that the result of this calculation will be used in a true up calculation to be discussed below for block . The algorithm used for the calculation may be one or more of those algorithms listed above for the other calculations or a different algorithm. The valuation method selected for valuing the shares of the collective investment vehicle may be the same method used to value the first set of assets or may be a different method.

Block comprises a computer implemented operation of calculating a redemption true up monetary amount to distribute or a true up monetary amount to receive depending on the result of the calculation. The redemption true up monetary amount is determined based on the monetary value at the strike time of the first set of one or more assets and either the monetary value as of the strike time of the number of shares requested to be redeemed or the monetary value as of the strike time comprising a number of shares approximated by the value specifying parameter to obtain the redemption true up monetary amount. In one embodiment the redemption true up amount is determined by calculating by one or more computers a difference between the value determined at the strike time of the first set of one or more assets and either the monetary value at the strike time of the number of shares requested to be redeemed or the monetary value at the strike time comprising a number of shares approximated by the value specifying parameter. In one embodiment a value of any fractional share is not included in the true up amount. In another embodiment the value of the fractional share is added to the positive or negative number comprising the true up amount.

Block represents an operation of communicating an amount based at least in part on the true up monetary amount. In one embodiment the true up amount itself is communicated to the MP or MP representative. In another embodiment an amount of a fractional share is added to the calculated true up amount. In another embodiment one or more other amounts are added to or subtracted from the true up amount based on details pertaining to the particular MP for other transactions of that MP. In one embodiment this communication operation is performed electronically by telephone by email by cell phone text messaging or other convenient electronic communication method. In one embodiment the communication may be implemented by Push software at a server on behalf of the manager of the collective investment vehicle. In another embodiment the communication operation comprises sending an electronic message via one or more computers and one or more networks to cause a clearing system to transfer an amount equal to the true up amount. By way of example the electronic message may be sent to the DTC or other clearing system as discussed herein to cause the transfer of assets between electronic accounts. Note that in one embodiment where the true up amount has one sign e.g. positive there may be a transfer of assets equal to the amount of the true up value from an account of the collective investment vehicle to an account of the MP or its MP representative. Alternatively if the true up amount has the opposite sign e.g. negative the transfer caused may be to transfer assets equal to the amount of the true up value from an account of the MP or its MP representative to the account of the collective investment vehicle.

Block comprises an operation of sending by the one or more computers and an electronic network an electronic message to cause a transfer of all or a portion of the first set of assets directly or indirectly to an electronic account of the MP representative. Note that the timing of the transfer of this first set of assets is not limited by the timing of the communication of block or the true up operation. In one embodiment the electronic message is to the DTC or other clearing system to cause transfer of the shares to be redeemed to an account of the MP or its MP representative or another designated third party. Note that in one embodiment steps and may be combined. Note that this distribution of the first set of assets to the account of the MP or its MP representative may take the same day T 0 the next day T 1 two days later T 2 three day later T 3 or at some other time. In an alternate embodiment the transfer amount may be effected directly by computers of the collective investment vehicle.

In one embodiment the collective investment vehicle comprises a plurality of the securities in a confidential portfolio of securities. Alternatively the collective investment vehicle may has a non confidential portfolio but the portfolio is actively managed so that it is desirable to maintain trades confidential for some period of time e.g. 1 hour several hours 1 day 2 days 3 days 1 week to name a few including permanently. In this embodiment the system imposes a requirement directly or it is imposed indirectly on its behalf for an appointment of an MP representative for the market participant MP to maintain confidentiality of the identity of some or all of the first set of assets being traded redeemed relative to the MP and to transform at least a portion of the first set of assets distributed into a second set of one or more assets that are different from the first set of assets. Alternatively the MP representative may be required simply to maintain confidentiality of the composition of the first set of assets and not disclose the composition of the first set of assets to the MP for some period of time including permanently. For embodiments requiring a transformation of the assets. the transformation may be into cash or into different securities for example. A contract may be executed directly with the MP representative or directly with the MP or another third party to require that the MP representative maintain confidentiality of the composition of the first set of assets and not disclose the composition of the first set of assets to the MP and or to transform liquidate part of all of the first set of assets received to ensure that any assets delivered to the MP do not disclose the composition of the trade. In one embodiment the same type of contract would be set executed as that described herein for Authorized Participant representatives as described previously.

This embodiment further comprises that the electronic message in the step of sending an electronic message to cause transfer of the first set of assets has an electronic address or other information to cause transfer of the first set of assets only to the account of the MP representative on behalf of the MP.

In one embodiment the request to redeem is an electronic request received via the one or more electronic networks and the one or more computers.

In a further embodiment the determining the first set of assets to distribute comprises calculating by the one or more computers a profit value or a loss value for each of a respective one or more purchase lots of each of a plurality of the securities in the portfolio of securities and selecting securities to distribute in the first set of assets in part based on the profit value or loss value for each of the respective one or more purchase lots of the plurality of securities. In one embodiment the calculation of a profit value or a loss value is made for all purchase lots of each of the securities in the portfolio of securities in the collective investment vehicle and a selection of which lots to transfer as part of the first set of assets is determined based at least in part on this profit or loss calculation.

In a yet further embodiment the operation is performed of sending an electronic message by the one or more computers to cause a distribution of assets of the collective investment vehicle equal to the true up monetary value if the true up monetary amount is positive.

In a yet further embodiment the calculating a true up monetary amount step comprises determining a difference of the value of the first set of assets as of a strike time from the monetary value as of the strike time of the number of shares that were requested for redemption.

In a yet further embodiment the collective investment vehicle is an exchange traded fund ETF and the MP is an authorized participant AP and further comprising appointing or requiring appointment of a respective authorized participant representative AP representative to act for the respective authorized participant AP at least in redemption events with the ETF with the appointment including instructions that require confidentiality of an identity of one or more of the securities in the first set of assets of the ETF with the respective AP representative being independent from the respective AP at least to the extent that the respective AP representative cannot be forced by the respective AP to disclose one or more of the identities of the first set of assets for the redemption and wherein in this embodiment the causing distribution step comprises sending by the one or more computers and an electronic network an electronic message to authorize or otherwise initiate a process of transfer one or more of the first set of assets only to the account of the AP representative.

In a further embodiment one or more of the steps of calculating comprises directing by contract a third party to perform by computer the calculating step on behalf of the collective investment vehicle using one or more prescribed algorithms and having the third party perform the calculating step for one or more prescribed times. For example the calculation may need to be performed before a time such as 3 30 pm or at or after market close time or at another time.

In a further embodiment one or more of the steps of calculating comprise directing by contract a third party to perform at least one of the steps on behalf of the collective investment vehicle.

In a yet further embodiment the collective investment vehicle further comprises a plurality of securities in a confidential portfolio of securities and the method further comprises entering one or more agreements with one or more third parties directing the one or more third parties to perform on its behalf at least one of the calculating steps using one or more prescribed algorithms and with the calculation to be performed with specified data for prescribed times wherein the one or more agreements require the third parties to maintain in confidence information about contents of the portfolio of securities of the collective investment vehicle and or trades therefor and transmitting electronically by the one or more computers and an electronic network information relating to the confidential portfolio of securities to at least one third party that is directed to perform at least one of the calculating steps. For example this one or more calculations may be for obtaining the IIV.

In a further embodiment the collective investment vehicle is an exchange traded fund ETF and the MP is an authorized participant AP and the AP is represented by an authorized participant representative AP representative appointed to act for the respective authorized participant AP at least in redemption events with the ETF with the appointment including instructions requiring the AP representative to maintain confidentiality from and not disclose to the AP a composition of one or more of the first set of assets of the ETF to be delivered or provided in redemption or creation events and directly or implicitly requires the AP representative to transform through liquidation one or more of the first set of assets into cash or other one or more legal instruments in order to maintain such confidentiality. This embodiment further comprises the steps of receiving by the one or more computers and one or more electronic networks a given number of ETF shares requested to be redeemed as part of a request to redeem. This receiving step may comprise in one embodiment receiving into an electronic account held by the ETF in a clearing system such as the DTC a number of shares of the ETF transferred into the account. This embodiment further comprises distributing the first set of assets only to the AP representative. This distributing step may be performed in one embodiment by sending an electronic message by the one or more computers and one or more electronic networks to cause one or more securities of the portfolio of the ETF to be transferred to an electronic account held by the AP representative in the clearing system. In one embodiment the method comprises sending an electronic message to the AP representative to identify one or more of the first set of assets before the market close. In a further aspect the redemption true up monetary amount is transferred electronically to an account held by the AP representative.

In a further embodiment where the collective investment fund is an exchange traded fund ETF that maintains a confidential portfolio of securities the method further comprises the steps of contracting with a third party to calculate an intraday indicative value IIV or a portion thereof under confidentiality and transmitting electronically by the one or more computers and the one or more networks a composition of the confidential portfolio of securities in the ETF or a portion thereof to the third party for calculating the IIV or a portion thereof. The step is then performed of publishing or having published the calculated IIV as described herein.

In a yet further embodiment the collective investment vehicle computers may generate an application programming interface API to receive requests to redeem shares of the collective investment vehicle. The API may be made available on a website or via another network connection. The collective investment vehicle computers may be programmed to aggregate a number of shares from a plurality of requests to redeem shares and or to create share obtained over some period of time or aggregated until at least a threshold total redemption amount is reached to obtain a total number of shares to redeem in the method for redemption. This operation may facilitate retail redemptions and or creations. In one embodiment the collective investment vehicle may contract with one or more third parties to maintain a website or other aggregation site available on a website or via another network connection to aggregate on behalf of the collective investment vehicle a number of shares from a plurality of the requests to redeem shares and or to create shares and then provide to the collective investment vehicle a total number of shares to redeem for the redemption event or a total number of shares to create for the creation event.

Note that in some embodiments there may not be a need for performance of the disclosed true up operation when performing redemptions if a redemption basket is published or otherwise made available to the MP or his her MP representative or other agent initiating a redemption request and the redemption basket represents the actual portfolio of securities held by the collective investment vehicle. The accessibility of the redemption basket that represents the portfolio may indicate that only the securities and other assets and their proportions listed in the redemption basket are to be transferred in a redemption event with this MP. Accordingly in one embodiment the method and system may further comprise determining if a redemption basket for the collective investment is disclosed and only performing the steps for the redemption event in accordance with the method when the redemption basket for the collective investment vehicle is not disclosed. In a further embodiment the method comprises determining if a disclosed redemption basket for the collective investment represents or does not represent the actual portfolio of the collective investment vehicle and only performing the steps for the redemption event in accordance with the method when the redemption basket for the collective investment vehicle does not represent the actual portfolio of the collective investment vehicle. These only performing steps encompass but are not limited to triggering performance of the method or preventing the performance of the method. Note that the step of determining if a redemption basket for the collective investment represents or does not represent the actual portfolio of the collective investment vehicle may be obtained by accessing a database or a webpage or other network site or may keyed into the system by the manager or another. The method of making this determination is not limiting on the invention.

Note that the step of determining if there is a redemption basket disclosed may be performed in one embodiment by accessing a database or a website or other network address. In another embodiment the determining step may be performed manually by the manager of the collective investment vehicle or on his her behalf. In another embodiment the determining step may include a step of determining whether or not to make disclosure of a redemption basket to the given MP initiating the request or its agent to redeem based on one or more criteria such as for example a quantity of the redemption order or a relationship with the collective investment vehicle or a relationship with another entity such as the clearing system to name a few. This step of determining whether or not to disclose a redemption basket to the particular MP may be determined on the fly or may be performed earlier and then recorded in a database or at another network address.

In a further embodiment the method and system comprises determining whether to net collective investment vehicle shares from one or more creation events with shares from one or more redemption events based on one or more criteria if a determination is made to perform netting then netting shares from one or more of the creation events with shares from one or more of the redemption events to obtain a net number of shares and using the net number of shares in the performance of the creation event or the performance of the redemption event. Note that the operation of determining whether to net collective investment vehicle shares from one or more creation events with collective investment vehicles shares from one or more redemption events may be performed by accessing a database or a webpage or other network address. In another embodiment a determination of whether or not to net may be performed manually by the manager of the collective investment vehicle based on criteria such as a reduction of administrative cost or a reduction of SEC fees or based on a manager investment objective with respect to retaining or transferring out various lots of securities to name a few. The one or more criteria on which to base the determination to net is not limiting on the invention. The manager determination may be keyed into a database or a web page or other network address and may specify netting for redemption requests and creation requests received over a period of time such as an hour or multiple hours or up to a cutoff point or a day to name a few. Alternatively the manager determination may be made on the fly by selecting a set of one or more specific requests to redeem and one or more specific requests to create that have not yet been acted upon. In another embodiment the determination may be performed automatically by the one or more computers based on one or more computers.

If it is determined that netting is to be performed then the step is performed of netting shares from one or more of the creation events with shares from one or more of the redemption events to obtain a net number of shares. The netting may be performed in one embodiment by the one or more computers netting the shares from selected requests to redeem shares and selected requests to create shares with the selection based on one or more criteria such as the quantity of shares in the respective requests or an identity of the MP s making the respective requests to name a few. Alternatively the netting may be performed manually and a net number of shares resulting keyed into the system. This net number of shares would then be used in the method and system in the performance of the creation event or the performance of the redemption event depending on whether the net results in a number of shares to be created or results in a number of shares to be redeemed.

Block in comprises an operation of determining a value of assets for a creation event based on the number of shares to create or the value specifying parameter. This valuing step may be implemented electronically using the same algorithms described for block of or may be valued using a different algorithm. Note that if a value specifying parameter was received in a currency amount then the currency amount may be used as the value of the assets for the creation event e.g. an instruction to create 100 000 worth of collective investment vehicle shares.

Block in comprises an operation of determining based at least in part on the value of assets a first set of one or more assets to receive for the creation event comprising commodities or securities or legal instruments or comprising at least two selected from a group of cash commodities securities or legal instruments. This step may be implemented electronically similarly to that described for block of . In other words the assets determined to be received for the creation event may simply comprise a slice to be added to the collective investment vehicle. Alternatively the assets requested may focus on one or more assets that the collective investment manager wishes to acquire to increase the collective investment vehicle holding in view of his her investment strategy. The value of the assets determined will be based at least in part on the number of shares to be created or the value specifying parameter.
