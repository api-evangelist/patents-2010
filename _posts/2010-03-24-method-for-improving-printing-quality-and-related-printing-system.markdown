The present invention relates to a method for improving printing quality and a related printing system and more specifically to a method for improving printing quality by adding printing dots and a related printing system.

When a user uses a word processing software e.g. Word or a drawing software e.g. Coreldraw to control a printing device to print a color image GDI Graphics Device Interface functions provided by a driving program of the printing device such as an API Application Programming Interface for line drawing or word drawing may be used for generating an image to be printed. However when the printing device prints a line formed by one single column or row of pixels or a word of a small size the problem of discontinuous printed lines or obscure printed edges may occur due to influence of a halftone process performed on the color image and limiting of electrophotography so as to reduce the printing quality of the printing device in color image printing.

On the other hand when a user uses an application program to control the printing device to print a grayscale image the application program may directly transmit the processed grayscale image to the driving program instead. At this time if the grayscale image includes a line formed by one single column or row of pixels or a word of a small size the same problem may also occur as mentioned above so as to reduce the printing quality of the printing device in grayscale image printing.

Although the said problem may be solved by a method for modifying the electrophotographic setting of the printing device such as increasing exposure time this method may cause toner contamination of the printing device easily.

Thus how to solve the said problem of discontinuous printed lines or obscure printed edges should be a concern for a printing device in color image printing and grayscale image printing.

The present invention provides a method for improving printing quality the method comprising an application device transmitting an original image comprising a plurality of printing pixels to a driving device the driving device setting the plurality of printing pixels as a plurality of first printing dots the driving device detecting an edge of the original image the driving device setting a plurality of second printing dots according to a plurality of neighboring pixels corresponding to the edge and the driving device generating an image to be printed according to the plurality of first printing dots and the plurality of second printing dots.

The present invention further provides a printing system for improving printing quality the printing system comprising an application device for transmitting an original image the original image being formed by a plurality of printing pixels a driving device for processing the original image the driving device comprising an edge detecting unit for detecting an edge of the original image a printing dot setting unit for setting the plurality of printing pixels as a plurality of first printing dots and setting a plurality of second printing dots according to a plurality of neighboring pixels corresponding to the edge and an image generating unit for generating an image to be printed according to the plurality of first printing dots and the plurality of second printing dots and a printing device for printing the image to be printed.

These and other objectives of the present invention will no doubt become obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art after reading the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment that is illustrated in the various figures and drawings.

Please refer to which is a functional block diagram of a printing system according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. As shown in the printing system includes an application device a driving device and a printing device . The application device is used for transmitting an original image to the driving device . The original image is formed by a plurality of printing pixels. In this embodiment the application device may be preferably a word processing software e.g. Word or a drawing software e.g. Coreldraw . The driving device is used for processing the original image transmitted from the application device so as to control the printing device to print. The driving device may be preferably a printer driving software. As shown in the driving device includes an edge detecting unit a printing dot setting unit and an image generating unit . The edge detecting unit is used for detecting an edge of the original image. The printing dot setting unit is used for setting the plurality of printing pixels as a plurality of first printing dots and setting a plurality of second printing dots according to a plurality of neighboring pixels corresponding to the edge detected by the edge detecting unit . The image generating unit is used for generating an image to be printed according to the plurality of first printing dots and the plurality of second printing dots. The printing device is used for printing the image to be printed. In this embodiment the printing device may be preferably a printer or a multi function printer compatible to the driving device .

Please refer to which is a flowchart of a method for utilizing the printing system in to add printing dots.

The steps of the method are described in detail as follows. First in Step when a user operates the application device to perform printing of an original image the application device transmits the original image to the driving device for subsequent printing processes. After the printing device receives the original image transmitted from the application device the printing dot setting unit in the driving device may set the plurality of printing pixels as the plurality of first printing dots Step . At the same time the edge detecting unit may determine if the original image is a line formed via a line drawing API Application Programming Interface in the driving device called by the application device or a word formed via a word drawing API in the driving device called by the application device Step . When the edge detecting unit determines that the original image is a line the edge detecting unit may set the line as an edge of the original image Step and the printing dot setting unit may set the plurality of second printing dots according to the plurality of neighboring pixels corresponding to the edge Step .

It should be mentioned that the said edge detection of the original image and setting of the plurality of second printing dots may vary with the property of the line. In the following more detailed description for Step and Step is provided on premise that the original image is a horizontal line a vertical line or an oblique line.

Please refer to which is a comparison diagram of a horizontal line a vertical line and an oblique line after performing a process of adding printing dots according to the present invention. As shown in the images at the left side of before the process of adding printing dots according to the present invention has been not performed on the original image yet the original image is a horizontal line formed by one single row of printing pixels a vertical line formed by one single column of printing pixels or an oblique line. At this time the edge detecting unit may directly set the horizontal line the vertical line or the oblique line as the edge of the original image. That is if the original image is the horizontal line or the vertical line the printing dot setting unit may preferably set a next row or a next column of pixels relative to the plurality of printing pixels as the plurality of second printing dots. If the original image is the oblique line the printing dot setting unit may set a pixel in a next column relative to each printing pixel as the corresponding neighboring pixel and set each neighboring pixel as the corresponding second printing dot respectively so as to cause an additional line to be printed on the upper side of the oblique line as shown in the down right image of .

In brief no matter the original image is a horizontal line a vertical line or an oblique line the driving device is capable of generating the plurality of second printing dots correspondingly according to the aforementioned determining principle. The present invention may also utilize other method capable of achieving the same purpose instead. For example if the original image is the horizontal line the printing dot setting unit may set a former row of pixels relative to the horizontal line as the second printing dots so as to cause an additional line to be printed on the upper of the horizontal line. If the original image is the vertical line the printing dot setting unit may set a former column of pixels relative to the vertical line as the second printing dots so as to cause an additional line to be printed on the left of the vertical line. If the original image is the oblique line the printing dot setting unit may set a pixel in a next row relative to each printing pixel as the corresponding neighboring pixel and set each neighboring pixel as the corresponding second printing dot respectively so as to cause an additional line to be printed on the bottom side of the oblique line. As for which method is utilized it may depend on the practical application of the printing system .

Next after completing setting of the plurality of second printing dots the printing dot setting unit may set a color value of each second printing dot according to a color value of the corresponding first printing dot Step . For example the printing dot setting unit can set a color value of each second printing dot to be equal to that of the corresponding first printing dot.

After completing setting of the plurality of first printing dots and the plurality of second printing dots the image generating unit may generate a corresponding image to be printed according to the plurality of first printing dots and the plurality of second printing dots Step . Finally in Step the driving device may control the printing device to print the image to be printed which is formed by the plurality of first printing dots and the plurality of second printing dots so as to achieve the purpose of increasing the printing width of the original image. In summary via additionally printing an identical line at a side of an original line the printing width of the line printed by the printing device may be increased meaning that the line can be printed more clearly and continuously by the printing device . Thus the printing quality of the printing device in line printing is improved accordingly.

Next please refer to again. On the other hand when the edge detecting unit determines that the original image is a word formed via the word drawing API of the driving device called by the application device the edge detecting unit may set the last printing pixel in each row or column of the original image and the last row or column of printing pixels of the original image as the edge of the original image Step and the printing dot setting unit may set the plurality of second printing dots according to the plurality of neighboring pixels corresponding to the edge Step . For example please refer to which is a comparison diagram of a word after performing a process of adding printing dots according to the present invention. As shown in the left image of the application device utilizes a matrix of 0 s and 1 s to form the shape of the word 1 i.e. the original image wherein the 0 s represent dots not to be printed and the 1 s represent dots to be printed i.e. the first printing dots . Furthermore the application device simultaneously transmits a printing color value corresponding to the word to the driving device . Subsequently in this embodiment the edge detecting unit may set the last printing pixel in each row of the original image and the last row of printing pixels of the original image as the edge of the original image and then the printing dot setting unit may set the plurality of neighboring pixels corresponding to the edge as the plurality of second printing dots. That is the printing dot setting unit may change the value of each neighboring pixel from 0 to 1 as shown in the right image of . In such a manner the word size of the original image can be increased accordingly.

After completing the step of adding the plurality of second printing dots the printing dot setting unit may perform a gamma adjusting process on the plurality of first printing dots and the plurality of second printing dots according to a gamma table Step . More detailed description for the gamma table is as shown in which is a diagram of a gamma table according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. As shown in the gamma table is an I O curve chart wherein the smaller value represents the deeper color. When the gamma value of the gamma table is less than 1 the output value is greater than the input value so that the printing color of the original image is deepened accordingly. On other hand when the gamma value of the gamma table is greater than 1 the output value is less than the input value so that the printing color of the original image is weakened. In this embodiment the printing system preferably utilizes a gamma table that its gamma value is equal to 0.6 so as to achieve the purpose of deepening the printing color of the original image. For example if the input value is 200 the output value may be changed to 135 as shown in so that the printing color of the original image may be deepened accordingly.

Similarly after completing setting of the first printing dots and the second printing dots the image generating unit may generate an image to be printed according to the first printing dots and the second printing dots. Subsequently in Step the driving device may control the printing device to print the image to be printed.

In summary via a method for adding additional printing dots at the right side and the bottom side of the original image the printing size of the original image is enlarged meaning that the word can be printed more clearly by the printing device . Thus the printing quality of the printing system is improved accordingly.

It should be mentioned that adding of printing dots is not limited to the right side and the bottom side of the original image. For example the said additional printing dots may be added at the left side and the upper side of the original image instead. That is all methods for adding additional printing dots at a side of an original image may fall within the scope of the present invention. As for which method is utilized it may depend on the practical application of the printing system . Furthermore the present invention may also utilize other gamma table for meeting different printing needs of the printing system such as utilizing a gamma table that its gamma value is greater than 1 instead to weaken the printing color of the original image for toner saving.

Please refer to which is a flowchart of a method for adding printing dots by utilizing the printing system in according to another preferred embodiment of the present invention. The method includes the following steps.

Step The printing dot setting unit sets a plurality of printing pixels of the original image as a plurality of first printing dots 

Step The edge detecting unit sets a printing pixel in each row column of the original image as an edge of the original image when determining the original image is a grayscale image wherein a grayscale value of a pixel next to the printing pixel is equal to 0 

Step The printing dot setting unit sets a plurality of second printing dots according to a plurality of neighboring pixels corresponding to the edge 

Step The printing dot setting unit sets a grayscale value of each second printing dot according to a grayscale value of the corresponding printing pixel 

Step The image generating unit generates an image to be printed according to the plurality of first printing dots and the plurality of second printing dots 

As shown in and the major difference between this embodiment and the said embodiments is Step and Step . In the following more detailed description for the Step and Step is provided. As for other steps the related description is omitted herein since they are the same as those mentioned in the said embodiment. When the original image is a grayscale image the driving device may receive the grayscale image pre processed by the application device directly without performing the step of the application device calling the line drawing API or the word drawing API of the driving device even if the original image includes lines or words.

After the application device transmits the original image to the printing dot setting unit Step and the printing dot setting unit sets the plurality of printing pixels as the plurality of first printing dots Step the edge detecting unit may set a printing pixel in each row i.e. a horizontal scanning column i.e. a vertical scanning of the original image as the edge of the original image when determining the original image is a grayscale image Step wherein a grayscale value of a pixel next to the printing pixel is equal to 0. Subsequently the printing dot setting unit may set the plurality of second printing dots according to the plurality of neighboring pixels corresponding to the edge Step and set a grayscale value of each second printing dot according to a grayscale value of the corresponding printing pixel Step . The related description for the said scanning process may be as shown in which is a partial comparison diagram of a grayscale image after performing a process of adding printing dots according to the present invention. The left image of is a diagram of one image edge in the original image wherein N represents a grayscale value of the said printing pixel i.e. the first printing dot . First the edge detecting unit may perform the said horizontal scanning on the original image. When the edge detecting unit scans to the said first printing dot located at the upper left corner of the left image in the edge detecting unit may determine the first printing dot as the edge of the original image since a grayscale value of a pixel next to the first printing dot is equal to 0 and then determine the said pixel as the corresponding neighboring pixel. As shown in Step and Step the printing dot setting unit may set the said neighboring pixel as a second printing dot with a grayscale value being equal to N As shown in the middle image of .

After finishing the said horizontal scanning the edge detecting unit may perform the said vertical scanning on the original image. When the edge detecting unit scans to the said first printing dot located at the upper left corner of the middle image in the edge detecting unit may also determine the first printing dot as the edge of the original image since a grayscale value of a pixel next to the first printing dot is equal to 0 and determine the said pixel as the corresponding neighboring pixel and then set the said neighboring pixel as a second printing dot with a grayscale value being equal to N as shown in the right image of . Similarly when the edge detecting unit scans to the said second printing dot located at the middle of the middle image in the edge detecting unit may determine the second printing dot as the edge of the original image since a grayscale value of a pixel next to the second printing pixel is equal to 0 and determine the said pixel as the corresponding neighboring pixel and then set the said neighboring pixel as a second printing dot with a grayscale value being equal to N as shown in the right image of .

In summary via the said process of adding additional printing dots the edge of the original image may have four printing dots as shown in the right image of instead of having only one single printing dot as shown in the left image of . Similarly the process of adding additional printing dots may also be applied to other edges in the original image determined by the edge detecting unit according to the said edge determining principle.

Next as mentioned above after completing setting of the plurality of first printing dots and the plurality of second printing dots the image generating unit may generate the image to be printed according to the plurality of first printing dots and the plurality of second printing dots Step and then the driving device may control the printing device to print the image to be printed Step . In such a manner via a method for adding additional printing dots at the right side and the bottom side of the edge of the original image the edge of the image to be printed may be printed more clearly so as to improve the printing quality of the printing system . It should be mentioned that adding of printing dots is not limited to the right side and the bottom side of the edge of the original image. For example the said additional printing dots may be added at the left side and the upper side of the edge of the original image instead. That is all methods for adding additional printing dots at a side of an edge of an original image may fall within the scope of the present invention. As for which method is utilized it depends on the practical application of the printing system .

Compared with the prior art in which the problem of discontinuous lines or obscure edges may occur when a printing device prints a line formed by one single column or row of pixels or a word of a small size the present invention utilizes a method for adding additional printing dots at an edge of an original image instead such as printing an identical line at a side of an original line or adding additional printing dots at an edge of a word. In such a manner images can be printed more clearly and continuously by a printing device based on the present invention. Thus the problem of discontinuous lines or obscure edges can be prevented accordingly so as to improve printing quality of the printing device in image printing. Furthermore since the present invention improves the printing quality of the printing device by utilizing a software setting method instead of modifying hardware setting in the printing device the operating life and stability of the printing device is not influenced.

Those skilled in the art will readily observe that numerous modifications and alterations of the device and method may be made while retaining the teachings of the invention.
