title: Automated and self-adjusting data protection driven by business and data activity events
abstract: Techniques for adjusting the frequency of data backups and initiating event-driven backups in a storage system are disclosed herein. In one embodiment, a self-adjusting backup frequency, known as a “Change Rate Objective,” is defined to conduct or delay backups for one or more volumes in the storage system on the basis of an associated policy value. The Change Rate Objective may be tied to one or more business or data activity events, such as the amount and type of data changes since a last backup. The storage system may also be tailored to conduct or delay full or incremental backups on the basis of a Change Rate Objective that measures whether a full or incremental or differential backup is more appropriate. Various data or system failures, or data or business events may also be used to adjust the retention periods of continuous data protection (CDP) data and delay a rollup of CDP data.

The present invention generally relates to data storage and recovery techniques. The present invention more specifically relates to data backup activities and procedures initiated by business and data activity events that enable valuable data to be stored and recovered.

Tremendous data growth and evolving requirements for data availability continue to demand innovation in the critical operations of data protection and recovery. Legacy daily backups are insufficient for many business environments today. There is a need for more efficient and more frequent backups which has led to the proliferation of efficient block level incremental forever data backup techniques. Current backup techniques have even resulted in Continuous Data Protection CDP strategies that may capture and protect every data change occurring at the Input Output I O level.

Despite these advancements in data protection operations there are still inefficiencies in current methods. For example most data protection operations are time based daily hourly etc . While there is some flexibility and granularity in how often data protection operations are run time based data protection operations are by nature inconsistent with business data activities. Business data activities are often event based not time based.

CDP solutions protect data at the individual I O event level not on a time basis. CDP protects data at a very low granularity of data activity i.e. individual I O operations and thus has significant potential value for recovery. However there are some drawbacks of CDP operations. One drawback of CDP is that individual I O operations often do not directly represent any business event. Therefore recovery at the individual I O level may not directly represent business value. Yet another drawback of CDP operations is that it is extremely difficult and even sometimes impossible to synchronize individual I O operations with application transactions. Again recovery at the individual I O level may not represent a complete application or business transaction and is thus limited in value. In addition the potential value of data protection at the low level of granularity provided by CDP is not fully exploited. The granularity of CDP data is typically lost when CDP data is rolled up into snapshots or other backups and is thus unavailable for a variety of data failure events. CDP data may be saved for longer periods of time by configuring a longer retention period but this is very expensive in terms of processing and storage. For these reasons CDP backups though valuable are not pervasively used in the industry.

The present disclosure describes the implementation of a series of improved data protection methods designed to make an Information Infrastructure more aware of and more responsive to its environment particularly as a response to business and data activity events. Business data events include activities such as business transactions that modify or create data upgrades to business applications data movements or copies required by technology uplifts distribution of new software system configuration changes storage volume defragmentation processes and the like. These business data events are not fully captured and protected by existing data backup and recovery solutions that occur as a result of a time based schedule or I O operations.

Further the data protection techniques described herein are also able to respond to data activity events within an Information Infrastructure such as conducting a full backup based on the amount of data changed since the last full backup. The numerous variations to the presently disclosed techniques provide a robust and customizable backup solution that can meet recovery time and recovery point objectives RTO and RPO much faster and more efficiently than time based backup rules.

In one specific embodiment of the present invention disclosed herein a method for performing event driven automated and self adjusting backup operations in a storage management system includes establishing a change rate objective and an associated change rate objective value used for event driven backups of a data store. This change rate objective is used to measure changes within the data store resulting from one or more data activity events such as the amount or type of data changed within the data store. The change rate objective may also be a derived value based on multiple values.

The change rate objective within the data store and any appropriate data activities are then monitored to determine whether adequate changes have occurred and backup operations are warranted. The backup operations are then performed responsive to meeting or exceeding the change rate objective value. The backup operations may be further customized or modified on the basis of a policy. Additionally the backup operations may be coordinated with time based scheduled backup operations.

In another specific embodiment of the present invention automated and self adjusting backup operations may be performed in connection with full and incremental or differential backups of a data store. Multiple change rate objectives are employed to determine whether to postpone or accelerate timing for a full backup and likewise to postpone or accelerate an incremental or differential backup . For example a first change rate objective and an associated first change rate objective value may be established for conducting a full backup of the data store prior to a scheduled full backup with the first change rate objective value defining a threshold amount of changed data of the data store requiring the full backup. A second change rate objective and an associated second change rate objective value may be established for postponing a scheduled full backup and conducting an incremental or differential backup in lieu of the scheduled full backup with the second change rate objective value defining a maximum amount of changed data of the data store allowing an incremental or differential backup. The amount of data that has changed since a last full backup is monitored and a full backup of the data store is conducted responsive to determining a the amount of changed data backed up since the last full backup is greater than the first change rate objective value during an incremental or differential backup cycle or b the amount of changed data backed up since the last full backup is greater than the second change rate objective value during a full backup cycle and likewise an incremental or differential backup of the data store is conducted responsive to determining a the amount of changed data backed up for the data store since the last full backup is less or equal than the first change rate objective value during an incremental or differential backup cycle or b the amount of changed data backed up since the last full backup is less or equal than the second change rate objective value during a full backup cycle.

Another specific embodiment of the present invention provides for automated and self adjusting data protection in connection with continuous data protection operations of a data store. This is established through a policy to extend the retention of data produced from the continuous data protection operations over a period of time as the policy indicates one or more events requiring a retention period extension and duration of the retention period extension. When a data rollup is initiated for retained data the retention period extension will be retrieved from the policy according to the appropriate events. Ultimately the data rollup will be postponed for the duration of the retention period.

Another specific embodiment of the present invention provides for a storage management system comprising a processor a memory unit and instructions stored within the memory unit for performing event driven automated and self adjusting data protection activities consistent with the techniques described herein. Additionally another specific embodiment of the present invention provides for a computer program product for performing event driven automated and self adjusting data protection activities with the computer program product comprising a computer readable storage medium having computer readable program code embodied therewith to implement the techniques described herein.

The present disclosure provides a set of data backup techniques that may be used separately or in conjunction with existing data backup scenarios. In contrast to existing data backup strategies that are time based only e.g. performing backups nightly at 12 AM a data backup schedule may be modified by the various techniques of the present invention to occur more or less frequently on the basis of other relevant factors. These factors may be triggered by business or data activity events that more accurately drive the underlying need to perform the data backup in the first place.

The present disclosure describes improved data protection methods that may be time based adjustable based on changing environment conditions and may also be event based and tied directly to business events and data activity. These methods address the need for more efficient backup methods that are fully synchronized with applications and only run when required by business or data activity events. Further these methods also address the need for improvements in CDP operations such that retention times for CDP data can be automatically adjusted based on data or system failures or on business events.

One embodiment disclosed herein provides a data protection method that automatically adjusts the frequency of data backup operations based on data activity events. As data change activities increase the frequency of data backup operations may increase. Likewise when data change activities slow down or stop backup operations might be performed less frequently thus preserving system resources. This self adjusting backup frequency method can also perform regularly scheduled backups in coordination with the event driven backups. This self adjusting backup frequency referred to herein as a Change Rate Objective or CRO may be based on a specific amount of data e.g. 5 GB of changed blocks since the last snapshot or it may be based on a percentage of data changed e.g. if 1 of data has changed since the last backup or a number of data transactions. Further the CRO may be configured to apply to the creation of certain backup or disaster recovery copies or otherwise trigger useful events.

A further embodiment provides the data protection method as described above enhanced with a data activity backup policy that specifies the sensitivity of backup operations to data change activities in a storage management system. This policy is in addition to and coordinated with the specifications of the frequency of backup operations that are commonly used in existing time based scenarios.

Another embodiment provides an enhanced analysis of a changed rate objective applied to a traditional full backup plus incremental differential backup approach. The amount of data backed up in incremental or differential backups since the last full backup is tracked. When it comes time to do the next full or image backup e.g. a weekly full backup if the amount of incremental data backed up since the last full backup is less than some specified amount a change rate objective value the full backup is postponed until the amount of incremental backup data reaches the specified amount. Conversely if during an incremental backup it is determined that some specified amount of data or percentage of the full backup has changed since the last full backup an unscheduled full backup is initiated. This approach minimizes data protection operations when they are not needed to prevent performing unnecessary full backups when very little data has changed. This approach also initiates event driven data protection operations when required to facilitate recovery e.g. starting a full backup early if there is a lot of changed data . In many scenarios performing a full backup when there is a large amount of data change can enable faster recovery times by avoiding having to apply large amounts of incremental recoveries on top of the full backup.

Another embodiment of the present invention provides improved Continuous Data Protection CDP techniques that automatically adjust retention periods for CDP data based on data or system failures or on business events. CDP data is typically rolled up into snapshots or backups on a regular often timed basis. When this is done the low I O level of data protection granularity is lost. When a data system or storage failure event occurs there is a much higher probability that recent CDP data might be required. Rather than allowing CDP data to roll off and lose low levels of granular recovery in this embodiment CDP data retention periods are automatically adjusted i.e. extended based on a change rate objective value to retain this data longer when possible recovery events are recognized.

Referring to data storage and backup operations are depicted within a storage management system operable in connection with an embodiment of the present invention. The storage management system functions to store and manage data such as data file provided by client computing device . Within the storage management system the primary data store is typically used to maintain a working copy of data. A backup data store is also typically used to maintain a redundant copy of data changes from the primary data store .

In the configuration of the storage management system provides a processing server responsible for managing the data storage and backup operations within the system . The processing server is configured to implement data backup and storage policies as data storage activities within the primary data store are monitored with a monitor . The monitor acts to watch for triggering events or schedules in connection with data backup activities and the policies . Upon a determination of the need to conduct a backup the processing server will then proceed with necessary backup activities such as an event based backup or a time based backup to the backup data store .

Policies that specify the sensitivity of backup operations to data change activities can be implemented in any of several ways without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example the policy may include a parameter for turning on and off a Changed Rate Objective or event based backup. When turned off backup operations may follow normal time based backups. When turned on large amounts of changed data or large numbers of I O transactions may result in backup operations being performed outside the normal time based backups.

The policy may also include a Change Rate Objective based on a variety of sources including the rates of activity the amount of data the number I O operations performed amount of changed metadata or defined percentages. For example the Change Rate Objective may be a percentage of the total expected amount of data to be backed up in the next time scheduled backup. The expected amount of data to be backed up can be determined using any number of methods such as using the total size of data backed up for a given client using the size of the last full backup or using the average size of backups over a period of time.

As another example the Change Rate Objective may be a percentage of the total amount of data backed up for a given client. Or the Change Rate Objective may be a specified amount of changed data e.g. the number of Gigabytes of changed data . Thus in one embodiment a different type of Change Rate Objective and threshold may be used for each criteria. For example the following Change Rate Objectives values and thresholds may be deployed in a policy as follows 

In this embodiment each Change Rate Objective may be evaluated against its corresponding Change Rate Objective threshold to determine if the current backup operation should continue or be altered in any way.

Further the Change Rate Objective may be a normalized value that is derived from a combination of these factors. In another embodiment a single normalized value is used that incorporates one or more of the criteria. For example the Change Rate Objective values and thresholds described above may be combined into a single normalized value that provides further analysis as input to the disclosed self adjusting backup operations.

In one embodiment CRO  GB Changed Data is divided by CRO  GB Changed Data Threshold CRO  MB Changed Metadata is divided by CRO  MB Changed Metadata Threshold and CRO   of Total Client Backup Data is divided by CRO   of Total Client Backup Data Threshold to provide three Change Rate Objectives percentages. The average of these three Change Rate Objectives percentages is taken to give a CRO Normalized Value. The CRO Normalized Value is then compared against a client configured CRO Normalized Value Threshold to determine if the current backup operation should continue or be altered in any way. This provides additional analysis for self adjusting backup operations.

Consider a backup scenario where each of the individual Change Rate Objective values are just under their respective Change Rate Objectives thresholds say each is 95 of its threshold . No automated adjustments to the backup operations would be triggered by these individual CROs. However if CRO Normalized Value Threshold was set at 90 this scenario would still have sufficient change activity to warrant some adjustment of backup operations.

The Change Rate Objective may also be specified as the number of application or I O transactions since the last backup e.g. one embodiment may track the number of I O operations with a device driver implementation and compare this to the Change Rate Objective whereas another embodiment may monitor application transaction counters such as the System Change Number in an Oracle Database and compare this to the Change Rate Objective . When the Change Rate Objective is reached an additional backup operation may be initiated. A further policy parameter may specify whether to perform this changed data event driven backup in addition to or in lieu of the next regular time based backup.

It is apparent that by adjusting these policy parameters the sensitivity of backup operations may be adjusted to data change rate activity. For example assume the Change Rate Objective is implemented as a percentage of the total amount of data backed up for a client and that 2 5 of that client s data typically changes between each scheduled backup. If the Change Rate Objective is set to 100 an extra changed data driven backup will probably rarely if ever be performed. But if the Change Rate Objective is set to 5 or lower then extra changed data driven backups will occur in almost every backup cycle. In some data store implementations the Change Rate Objective will function most effectively when set between the range of 5 10 .

Two important concepts relevant to the data protection and recovery solutions disclosed herein are commonly known as Recovery Time Objectives RTO and Recovery Point Objectives RPO . Recovery Time Objectives specify how quickly a business needs to recover lost data. Recovery Point Objectives specify how far back in time a business can afford to lose data. RTO and RPO are both typically implemented as time based objectives. For instance a customer might require a RTO of 1 hour to recovery and can only tolerate 3 hours worth of data loss RPO . However like data protection operations time based RPOs can also be inconsistent with business data activities. For example consider what happens if a RPO is 3 hours. In some cases this may be sufficient. However in times when there is intensive work being done on the system resulting in large amounts of data changes that need to be backed up a 3 hour RPO may be insufficient and expose a business to a severe data loss. A Change Rate Objective provides improvements over the use of RTO and RPO to allow recognition and response to increased data change activity or increased transaction activity with an increased frequency of data backup operations.

As previously discussed existing data protection techniques in the art are generally time scheduled and not directly associated with data activity or business events. CDP data protection is generally I O event based not time based but it presents drawbacks when used as the exclusive data backup strategy. The disclosed embodiments of the present invention provide improved data protection techniques that in addition to factoring time based schedules also may be tied directly to important business events and data activity.

Therefore the data protection methods disclosed herein may enable in addition to time based backup operations backup operations driven by data activity and business events. Monitors may be used to exploit techniques that recognize these events ultimately leading to responses to these events. For example a monitor may be configured to recognize specific business events assess the impact of those events on data protection operations analyze policy related to the specific events and initiate event driven backups as warranted. These types of policy based backup operations enable event based recoveries such as the recovery of data at a point in time before a specific business event occurred .

As a non limiting list of relevant business events backup activities may be initiated based on upgrades to business applications data movements or copies required by technology uplifts application migrations server migrations and the like distribution of new software system configuration changes storage volume defragmentation processes I O errors on volumes events which change large sets of data events which change large amounts of metadata such as changes to data security settings and other similar events or event triggers.

The following sections provide additional detail and working examples of embodiments configured to implement data backups with the use of a change rate objective a in connection with event driven backup operations b in full versus incremental differential backup scenarios and c in connection with improved CDP backup operations. Those skilled in the art would recognize that a number of variations to these techniques may be used and applied within a storage system such as the combination of a changed rate objective event driven backup with full or incremental backups.

In one specific embodiment a data activity backup policy may be defined within a software environment through the use of a set of variable data values. These values are provided in examples of the following paragraphs as policy values. As is evident the data activity backup policy may be implemented in a software environment with alternate names or through the use of programming language values values within an XML data file direct input from a user within a user interface or like types of settings and selections. In one embodiment these policy values may include 

This data activity backup policy may then be applied within a storage system to conduct data backups and scheduled backups as triggered by the change rate objective value. The change rate objective generally is a variable value that may be modified by a system administrator as appropriate. For example a system administrator recognizing that resource intensive backups are too frequently occurring may increase the change rate objective value. If the change rate objective value is based on a combination of factors minimum or maximum values may be associated with the factors in whole or in part. e.g. a configuration may automatically trigger a backup at a 5 GB or an 8 change in the data store whichever occurs first .

When a full plus incremental or full plus differential backup approach is employed in a storage system special policy processing and analysis is used. In combination with existing techniques e.g. with full plus differential backup methods the amount of data that has changed since the last full backup may be tracked. This special policy processing and analysis may be accomplished by defining the following policy to monitor data activity occurring since a last full backup.

In one embodiment CDP techniques may be configured to automatically adjust retention periods based on data or system failures or on business or data activity events. CDP operations may be improved through the use of an interface and policy to expect the notification of possible business recovery events. In addition a new policy may be introduced to allow dynamic adjustments to CDP data retention periods.

A monitor of data or system failures or on business events which impact CDP and backup storage operations may be used according to a variety of monitoring techniques and technology. This monitor may be configured to recognize various business failures or recovery events that might impact CDP operations. For example business failures or events might include failure of a server volume or application or some other outage in the computing environment within which the volume resides. Any such type of failure or event might indicate a need to retain recent CDP data for all possibly affected volumes for a longer period of time.

In one embodiment when a monitor recognizes a failure or event it may be configured to send an API call to an enhanced CDP component for each volume or entity for which CDP is being performed that might be impacted by the event. This indicates to the improved CDP component the need to extend the retention time period of CDP data for each of those volumes. When the event is cleared another API call is sent to the improved CDP component for each volume. This indicates to the improved CDP component that the retention period extensions may be released and the normal policy for CDP data retention for that volume may be resumed.

An adjustable retention period may be used to control the severity of the event as determined by the monitor s . The higher the severity of the event the longer time the CDP data is retained for. When an event is cleared or when the dynamically assigned retention extension has passed the improved CDP component resumes its normal policy for CDP data retention.

In the specific embodiment referenced above API calls may be defined within the enhanced CDP component to receive information related to the notification of a CDP data retention event and the clearing of the event. The following demonstrates non limiting examples of two APIs to establish and clear data retention events respectively 

The parameters used in these example APIs may be configured to accept or return the following data values Server ID indicating the name of the server owning the volume with CDP data Application ID if applicable indicating the name of the application owning the volume with CDP data Volume ID indicating the unique identifier of the volume for which CDP is being performed and which might be impacted by a business failure or event Time of Event indicating the time of business failure or event that might impact this volume Severity of Event indicating the criticalness of the business failure or event this parameter has a direct correspondence to the additional length of time that CDP data for this volume is retained Event Identifier such as a token indicating a unique identifier for this event and Completion Status such as a return code indicating completion status of this API call.

Those skilled in the art would recognize that the example APIs described above may be configured to include additional or fewer parameters depending on the configuration of the storage management system and the type of interfaces employed with the storage management system. Further methods other than API calls may be used to establish or clear data retention events in connection with CDP data and rollups.

In another specific embodiment a CDP Data Retention Policy is defined in connection with the use of a series of API calls such as those previously described. The policy may be used to indicate the following values relevant to CDP data retention 

If any events recorded for the volume require a retention period extension as determined in step then the event is checked against a CDP Data Retention Policy as in step to determine how long to extend the retention of CDP data for the volume. For example if the severity is low then the retention will equal the retention value plus a Low Severity Retention value. If the severity is medium then the retention will equal the retention value plus a Medium Severity Retention value. If the severity is high then the retention will equal the retention value plus a High Severity Retention value. After either the retention period is defined or the CDP data for the volume is rolled up the rollup operation for the volume is complete as in step .

In a further embodiment the monitoring and event management techniques described herein may be used to implement specific business event based data protection. For example the following events may be monitored in conjunction with event management components that are utilized to initiate data protection operations for the associated data and storage. A simple policy may be introduced to control automated response for each business event type.

These business event types may include upgrades to business applications backups may be desirable both before and after upgrades data movements or copies required by technology uplifts application migrations server migrations and the like system configuration changes storage volume defragmentation processes I O errors on volumes data or system failures changes occurring based on an amount of changed data and events which change large amounts of metadata such as changes to data security settings. Those skilled in the art would recognize other categories of information that would apply as a business event.

Therefore the presently disclosed monitors may be configured to recognize specific business events assess the impact of those events on data protection operations analyze policy related to the specific events and initiate event driven backups as warranted. Further data activity events may also occur in conjunction with a number of the business events

Other variations to the presently disclosed embodiments are possible. A system may be configured to respond to data related events or business related events exclusively. Other policy values may be utilized in conjunction with or as a derivative value of the change rate objective. Likewise other API calls data components and event monitoring components and strategies may be utilized in conjunction with the presently disclosed embodiments. Further the features described herein may be embodied within stand alone or integrated storage management software or components located throughout or even outside a storage system.
