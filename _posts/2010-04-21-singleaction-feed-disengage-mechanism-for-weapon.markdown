title: Single-action feed disengage mechanism for weapon
abstract: A feed disengage mechanism for a weapon with a sprocket-type feed system may include a sprocket rotatably fixed to the receiver. A forward pawl may be selectably engageable with a forward end of the sprocket. The forward pawl may include a flange and be biased for engagement with the sprocket. An anti-backup pawl may be selectably engageable with a rear end of the sprocket. The anti-backup pawl may include a cam path and be biased for engagement with the sprocket. A feed cover may include a feed slide assembly that may be translatable in a slot in the feed cover. The feed slide assembly may include a front pin engageable with the flange of the forward pawl and a rear pin engageable with the cam path of the anti-backup pawl.

The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

The invention relates in general to weapons and in particular to the loading and unloading of belted ammunition.

Weapons such as for example machine guns may have sprocket type ammunition feed systems. Weapons with fixed axis sprocket feed systems may require pawls that convert the bi directional movement of the operating group to a one way rotational movement of the sprocket. Two pawls may achieve a ratcheting movement that allows the sprocket to turn in only one direction to index the next ammunition. Therefore loading and unloading of the ammunition belt may require that the pawls be disengaged from the sprocket so that the sprocket may freely rotate.

It is an object of the invention to provide an apparatus for a weapon that may disengage the feed system pawls and open the feed cover of the weapon.

It is another object of the invention to provide a weapon including an apparatus that may disengage the feed system pawls and open the feed cover of the weapon.

In one aspect of the invention a weapon may include a barrel fixed to a receiver a sprocket rotatably fixed to the receiver and having a longitudinal axis substantially parallel to a longitudinal axis of the barrel a forward pawl selectably engageable with a forward end of the sprocket and reciprocable along the longitudinal axis of the sprocket the forward pawl including a flange and being biased for engagement with the sprocket an anti backup pawl selectably engageable with a rear end of the sprocket and reciprocable along the longitudinal axis of the sprocket the anti backup pawl including a cam path and being biased for engagement with the sprocket a feed cover rotatable about the longitudinal axis of the sprocket and a feed slide assembly slidably engaged with the feed cover the feed slide assembly including a front pin engageable with the flange of the forward pawl and a rear pin engageable with the cam path of the anti backup pawl.

In another aspect of the invention a method may include providing the weapon described above and disengaging the forward pawl from the sprocket by translating the feed slide assembly forward. The method may include after disengaging the forward pawl disengaging the anti backup pawl by rotating the feed slide assembly.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

A single action feed disengage mechanism may facilitate the loading and unloading of belted ammunition for weapons with sprocket type feed systems. The single action feed disengage mechanism may simultaneously achieve the functions of disengaging the pawls and opening the feed cover in two motions.

An anti backup pawl may be selectably engageable with a rear end of the sprocket . Anti backup pawl may be reciprocable along the longitudinal axis B of the sprocket . The anti backup pawl may include a cam path . Anti backup pawl may be biased for engagement with the sprocket . A spring may be disposed between a protrusion on the anti backup pawl and an inner surface of a stationary plate to provide the bias for the anti backup pawl .

A feed cover shown in full in is shown partially cut away in . Feed cover may be rotatable about the longitudinal axis B of the sprocket . A feed slide assembly shown in full in is shown partially cut away in . The feed slide assembly may be translatable in a slot in feed cover . The feed slide assembly may include a front pin that may abut the rear side of flange of the forward pawl . The feed slide assembly may include a rear pin that may be engageable with the cam path of the anti backup pawl . The feed slide assembly may rotate with the feed cover .

A handle may be fixed to the front pin . A weapon operator may use handle to translate feed slide assembly .

The forward and anti backup pawls may be locked in the disengaged position of by the rear pin in cam path . is a side view of an embodiment of an anti backup pawl with a cam path . The orientation of anti backup pawl shown in is as if the weapon were pointed vertically. When rear pin reaches the end of cam path the rear pin bears against the cam path surface preventing the feed slide assembly from moving rearward.

The forward and the anti backup pawls may be unlocked from the disengaged position by rotating the feed slide assembly in a direction opposite a direction of rotation for locking the forward and anti backup pawls in the disengaged position. After unlocking the forward and anti backup pawls the forward pawl may be re engaged with the sprocket by translating the feed slide assembly rearward.

While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
