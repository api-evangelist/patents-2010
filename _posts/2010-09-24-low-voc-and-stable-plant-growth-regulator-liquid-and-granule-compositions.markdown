The present invention relates to stable and water soluble plant growth regulator compositions with low amounts of volatile organic compounds VOCs .

The present invention generally relates to stable and water soluble plant growth regulator compositions with low amounts of volatile organic compounds VOCs .

Plant growth regulators are useful for influencing a range of plant developmental processes including stem elongation germination dormancy flowering sex expression enzyme induction fruit size and quality as well as leaf and fruit senescence. Plant growth regulators may be formulated in at least five different types of formulations 1 solutions 2 wettable powders 3 soluble powders 4 tablets and 5 water soluble or dispersible granules.

Cytokinins are a class of plant growth regulators which are generally defined as N6 substituted adenine derivatives such as trans zeatin 6 benzyladenine 6 BA and kinetin. Recently a new class of cytokinins has been identified which possess N phenylurea substituted structure such as forchlorfenuron CPPU and thidiazuron TDZ . Cytokinins are of extreme importance in regulating plant growth and development especially cell division. They are marketed under various trade names and are commercially used in fruit thinning and sizing as well as pre and post harvest treatments of ornamental plants and flowers.

6 BA and CPPU have very low water solubility of 44 and 39 ppm at 25 C. respectively. Alcoholic solvents such as IPA THFA and propylene glycol are being employed in conventional liquid plant growth formulations. For example US Patent Application US 2008 0039322 A1 discloses cytokinin solution formulations comprising propylene glycol. However one of the disadvantages of alcoholic solvents is that they are considered volatile organic compounds VOCs having relatively high photochemical reactivity for ground level ozone formation and therefore may be harmful to the environment. The United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA estimates the maximum incremental reactivity MIR of volatile organic compounds or solvents which can participate in atmospheric photochemical reactions MIR measures grams ozone produced per grams VOC .

Various regulatory agencies such as the EPA the California Department of Pesticide Regulation DPR and Air Resources Board CARB seek to lower the VOC content in various agricultural products and fumigants.

There is a significant formulation challenge to meet the requirements of lowering the VOC content while preserving product stability and effectiveness.

There is therefore a need to develop effective plant growth regulator compositions that contain low amounts of VOCs.

The present invention is generally directed to stable water soluble low VOC plant growth regulator compositions. The compositions of the present invention comprise less than about 25.0 by weight of volatile organic compounds VOCs measured by Thermogravimetric Analysis TGA .

The compositions described above may be used to regulate plant growth of fruit producing plants vegetable producing plants row crops vegetable crops grasses or trees. The benefits of using the compositions of the present invention vary according to the type of plant treated. For example in grapes treatment with the compositions can lead to cluster elongation thinning and larger grapes. In oranges lemons limes and tangerines the formulation can lead to a delay in the aging of the rind and reduce disorders such as rind staining water spotting sticky or tacky surface puffy rind or rupture under pressure. In cherries the compositions may advantageously be used to produce larger brighter colored and or firmer fruit.

The compositions of the present invention are preferably diluted in water and sprayed on the plant or tree to be treated. The spraying may be by conventional ground or aerial application equipment. Spray volumes are variable depending upon the orchard or crop growth stage and climatic conditions. The range may be 5 gallons to 300 gallons acre or higher. A presently preferred range is between 100 to 250 gallons per acre by pressurized spray application equipment. To prepare a composition for application a tank is half filled with water followed by spray addition of adjuvant and then addition of the plant growth regulator composition followed by addition of more water and mixing for at least 15 minutes prior to actual spraying.

Alternatively the compositions of the present invention may be directly applied to the soil in which the plant will be grown or is growing with or without granular fertilizers for the improved growth and maintenance of crops.

Moreover the compositions of the present invention may be applied to seeds to achieve the same effect. The seed may be rice or paddy alfalfa cotton sorghum soybeans corn or other vegetables ornamental or turf and pasture grass seed among others.
