title: Supplementing biometric identification with device identification
abstract: A computer may identify an individual according to one or more biometrics based on various physiological aspects of the individual, such as metrics of various features of the face, gait, fingerprint, or voice of the individual. However, biometrics are often computationally intensive to compute, inaccurate, and unable to scale to identify an individual among a large set of known individuals. Therefore, the biometric identification of an individual may be supplemented by identifying one or more devices associated with the individual (e.g., a mobile phone, a vehicle driven by the individual, or an implanted medical device). When an individual is registered for identification, various device identifiers of devices associated with the individual may be stored along with the biometrics of the individual. Individuals may then be identified using both biometrics and detected device identifiers, thereby improving the efficiency, speed, accuracy, and scalability of the identification.

Within the field of computing many scenarios involve an identification of an individual using one or more biometrics. As a first example a camera may capture an image or video recording of the individual may evaluate various visible aspects of the individual e.g. facial features body shape and gait and may generate a set of visible biometrics that represent the individual. As a second example a microphone may capture and evaluate the voice of the individual and various biometrics may be identified based on the acoustic properties of the voice e.g. pitch timbre and rate of speech . As a third example a fingerprint scanner may capture and evaluate a fingerprint of the individual and biometrics relating to the pattern of ridges and whorls of the fingerprint may be identified. These analyses may be initially performed to capture one or more biometrics identifying the individual and may be stored e.g. in a biometric database associating the biometrics with an individual identity of the individual. Later when an unidentified individual is detected various biometrics may be captured and compared with those in the biometric database to identify the individual. Such capturing and identification may involve multiple biometrics either of the same modality e.g. multiple biometric measurements of the face of the individual or of different modalities e.g. a facial feature a fingerprint and a voiceprint of the individual in order to improve the accuracy of the identification.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

Identifying individuals using biometrics may be difficult or inefficient in several respects. As a first example the capturing and evaluation of the biometrics may comprise resource intensive processes thereby utilizing a high number of computing resources e.g. power processor storage memory and or network capacity . The resource utilization may incur a significant delay in performing the biometric analyses and or may be difficult to implement on computing devices having limited resources. As a second example biometric evaluation may not be adequately robust and may produce different results in different circumstances e.g. different biometrics may be generated from the face of an individual if the visual lighting of the scene changes if the angle of the captured image of the face changes if the individual makes a different facial expression during capturing or if the face of the individual changes such as the use of different make up a different hair color or style or an acquired physical deformity . These new circumstances may result in false negatives e.g. failing to recognize a known individual and or false positives e.g. incorrectly identifying an unknown individual as a known individual or confusing a first known individual with a second known individual . Moreover these inefficiencies may be exacerbated as the biometrics system scales to identify hundreds or thousands of individuals e.g. if a particular biometric is stored as a hash value the probability of a hash collision among two or more individuals may grow at an unacceptable rate.

Presented herein are techniques for supplementing the identification of biometrics with other information about an individual that may be more efficiently and or accurately identified. It may be appreciated that in many contemporary scenarios individuals often carry one or more devices that may be identifiable by the computer performing the biometric identification. For example an individual may regularly carry a particular mobile phone a pager a mobile computer such as a palmtop laptop or tablet computer a gaming device a camera an audio or video player or an implanted medical device e.g. a pacemaker . The computer may be able to detect an identifier of the device where the device identifier distinctively identifies the device e.g. an identifier that identifies only one device or differentiates the device from other devices that may be carried by other individuals e.g. a particular model of a mobile phone . The computer may therefore associate one or more devices with an individual who carries the devices and may while registering the individual identity of an individual e.g. while creating a user account in a user database associate the device identifier of a detected device with the individual identity. Subsequently when the computer seeks to identify an unidentified individual the computer may in addition to identifying one or more biometrics of the individual detect one or more devices carried by the individual and may detect one or more device identifiers of the respective devices e.g. a device ID of a mobile phone such as a mobile phone number and or a device ID of an implanted medical device such as a pacemaker . The computer may then search the biometric database for individuals associated both with the detected biometrics and with the detected device identifiers. For example the detected device identifiers may be utilized to reduce the number of individual identities that may match the biometrics of the individual. The capturing storage and retrieval of device identifiers may therefore supplement the identification of the individual according to various biometrics.

The inclusion of a device identifier to supplement the identification of an individual using biometrics may present some advantages over using only biometrics. As a first example if the set of individuals who may be identified via biometrics is potentially large the set of individuals potentially matching an unknown individual may be significantly reduced based on the device identifier e.g. of a large set of known individuals only a small number of such individuals may be known to carry a particular device type so when an individual carrying the device type is presented the number of individuals to be considered for biometric identification may be significantly reduced thereby increasing the efficiency speed accuracy and scalability of the identification. As a second example the identification of a device may often be achieved with fewer computing resources than identifying a biometric thereby providing an additional piece of evidence of the identity of the individual with a comparatively lower use of computing resources

To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects advantages and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.

The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident however that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.

Within the field of computing many scenarios involve an identification of an individual using a set of one or more biometrics. For various individuals a computer may register an individual identity by capturing measurements of various physical properties of the individual. When the computer is later presented with an individual the computer may then perform the same types of measurements on the individual and may identify the individual by identifying an individual identity having the same measurements.

As a first example a camera may capture an image or video recording of an individual and may evaluate various visible aspects of the individual e.g. facial features such as the distance between the eyes and the width of the nose body shape such as height and build and gait such as stride length cadence and arm swing . These measurements may form a set of biometrics that represent various visible aspects of the individual. As a second example a microphone may capture and evaluate the voice of the individual. Various acoustic properties of the voice of the individual may be measured e.g. pitch timbre and rate of speech and may be utilized as biometrics based on the voice of the individual. As a third example an optical or capacitative fingerprint scanner may detect various properties of a fingerprint of the individual such as the depth of ridges locations and sizes of whorls and lengths of valleys. When initially presented with an individual a computer may capture one or more biometrics identifying the individual and may store such biometrics e.g. in a biometric database comprising one or more individual identities that respectively represent an individual based on a set of biometrics. Some such computers may capture multiple biometrics for an individual either of the same modality e.g. multiple biometric measurements of the face of the individual or of different modalities e.g. a facial feature a fingerprint and a voiceprint of the individual . When an unidentified individual is detected the computer may then capture various biometrics of the individual and compare such biometrics with those in the biometric database and may select an individual identity matching some or all of the biometrics.

However the exemplary scenario of may result in some inefficiencies and or disadvantages. As a first example the analysis of representations to identify biometrics may be computationally intensive and may consume a significant amount of power processor memory storage and or network capacity. For example identifying biometrics from the face of an individual may involve a high resolution image captured with a camera the application of sophisticated machine vision algorithms to identify the location of the face in the image and the features thereof and the computation of biometrics such as hashcodes using various hash algorithms . Additionally the computational resources involved in identifying a large number of individuals may rapidly increase and may steadily reduce the perform ant nature of the biometric identification as a large number of individuals are registered. More computationally powerful computers may be capable of performing this analysis for one or several biometrics but at a significant cost of resources and possibly with a noticeable delay in identifying the individual and less computationally powerful computers may have to scale back to a more rudimentary identification of biometrics e.g. a lower resolution image or less sophisticated machine vision algorithms that may be less accurate or may simply be incapable of performing the analysis .

As a second example biometrics may often be inaccurate. For example the biometrics identified for the face of an individual may change if the face of the individual is image in a different light or at a different angle if the individual makes a different facial expression such as smiling if the individual appears different due to the use of make up or a change of hairstyle or if the individual suffers a facial deformity. Similarly the biometrics identified from the gait of an individual or from a fingerprint of the individual may change if the individual walks differently or intentionally or accidentally damages the skin of the finger. The use of multiple biometrics may alleviate some of these changes e.g. capturing three different biometrics may allow a reliable identification of the individual even if one biometric changes but further increases the computational costs of the biometric identification.

As a third example individual identification via biometrics may not scale well to match the identification of a large number of individuals . For example the complexity and inaccuracy of the identification system may increase in proportion with the number of individuals who are registered with the identification system. Identifying a particular individual among a large set of known individuals may therefore involve a greater number variety and precision of measurements are increasingly sensitive to smaller changes in the physiology of the individual . This expansion may increase the costs complexity delay and or inaccuracy of the identification system thereby limiting its scalability when utilized to identify a potentially large number of individuals .

Due to these problems it may be appreciated that systems that identify individuals based solely on biometrics may be inefficient or inadequate in some scenarios. However some of these disadvantages may be alleviated by utilizing other information about an individual that may supplement the biometric identification by providing additional information as to the identity of an individual. Additionally it may be desirable to collect information that is comparatively easy to obtain e.g. without involving computationally intensive analyses and or that may be collected without the involvement and perhaps without the knowledge and or cooperation of the individual .

One such piece of information relates to devices that an individual may carry. In many contemporary scenarios individuals often carry one or more devices such as a mobile phone a pager a mobile computer such as a palmtop laptop or tablet computer a global positioning system GPS receiver a gaming device a camera an audio or video player or an implanted medical device e.g. a pacemaker or cochlear implant . Such devices may even include devices lacking an independent power source such as a radiofrequency identifier RFID chip embedded in an identification card such as a bank card or credit card a solid state data storage chip or a Subscriber Identity Module SIM card inserted in a mobile phone. The individual may have a known association with such a device such as a regular habit of carrying the device. The computer may be able to identify a device in the proximity of the individual either precisely e.g. the device having a distinctive identifier as a particular device type e.g. a particular model such as a model or brand of a mobile phone or as a device class e.g. simply a mobile phone of an unidentified model type . This information alone may be inadequate for identifying the individual . For example a device detector may only be able to identify the location of a device and presumably the individual carrying it within a general area e.g. a one hundred meter radius around a WiFi receiver while a biometric detector may identify the location of the individual with much greater precision. However the detection of the device may be useful for supplementing the biometric identification of the individual . For example this information may be used to reduce the number of individual identities of the individual identity set to those that are associated with the detected device and the computer may be able to perform less searching and or to collect a fewer number of biometrics in order to complete the identification of the individual thereby resulting in a faster and or more efficient identification of the individual .

The identification of a device associated with an individual may also have other advantages. For example the identification of a device associated with the individual may be used to improve the accuracy of the identification of the individual such as by resolving conflicts among the collected biometrics e.g. where an individual matches only two out of three biometrics comprising an individual identity the identification of a device associated with the individual identity and detected in the proximity of the individual may resolve the uncertainty and or to resolve conflicts among individual identities e.g. in the case of a hash collision where a biometric identified for an individual is associated with two individual identities the detection of the device that is associated with only one of the two individual identities may facilitate a resolution of the hash collision . The use of the device identification may therefore improve the efficiency speed accuracy and or scalability of the biometric identification system utilized by the computer .

Still another embodiment involves a computer readable medium comprising processor executable instructions configured to apply the techniques presented herein. Such computer readable media may include e.g. computer readable storage media involving a tangible device such as a memory semiconductor e.g. a semiconductor utilizing static random access memory SRAM dynamic random access memory DRAM and or synchronous dynamic random access memory SDRAM technologies a platter of a hard disk drive a flash memory device or a magnetic or optical disc such as a CD R DVD R or floppy disc encoding a set of computer readable instructions that when executed by a processor of a device cause the device to implement the techniques presented herein. Such computer readable media may also include as a class of technologies that are distinct from computer readable storage media various types of communications media such as a signal that may be propagated through various physical phenomena e.g. an electromagnetic signal a sound wave signal or an optical signal and in various wired scenarios e.g. via an Ethernet or fiber optic cable and or wireless scenarios e.g. a wireless local area network WLAN such as WiFi a personal area network PAN such as Bluetooth or a cellular or radio network and which encodes a set of computer readable instructions that when executed by a processor of a device cause the device to implement the techniques presented herein.

An exemplary computer readable medium that may be devised in these ways is illustrated in wherein the implementation comprises a computer readable medium e.g. a CD R DVD R or a platter of a hard disk drive on which is encoded computer readable data . This computer readable data in turn comprises a set of computer instructions configured to operate according to the principles set forth herein. In one such embodiment the processor executable instructions may be configured to perform a method of identifying individuals such as the exemplary method of . In another such embodiment the processor executable instructions may be configured to implement a system for identifying individuals such as the exemplary system of . Some embodiments of this computer readable medium may comprise a non transitory computer readable storage medium e.g. a hard disk drive an optical disc or a flash memory device that is configured to store processor executable instructions configured in this manner. Many such computer readable media may be devised by those of ordinary skill in the art that are configured to operate in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

The techniques discussed herein may be devised with variations in many aspects and some variations may present additional advantages and or reduce disadvantages with respect to other variations of these and other techniques. Moreover some variations may be implemented in combination and some combinations may feature additional advantages and or reduced disadvantages through synergistic cooperation. The variations may be incorporated in various embodiments e.g. the exemplary method of and the exemplary system of to confer individual and or synergistic advantages upon such embodiments.

A first aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the scenarios wherein such techniques may be utilized. As a first variation of this first aspect these techniques may be utilized to track many types of biometrics using many types of biometric detectors such as cameras microphones tactile sensors and chemical analyzers as well as many types of algorithms such as machine vision algorithms acoustic analysis algorithms and machine learning algorithms that are developed and or trained to perform tasks such as pattern recognition. For example the biometric detector may comprise a camera configured with a face detection component e.g. an algorithm configured to analyze an image identify an area of the image depicting a face of an individual and extract biometrics from the detected face and the biometrics identifying the individual may comprise face biometric measurements.

As a second variation of this first aspect these techniques may be utilized to track many types of devices using many types of device detectors . As a first example the device detector may comprise many types of wireless or wireless communication adapters e.g. cellular network adapters local area network adapters and wide area network adapters or even a camera configured to visually identify the device and possibly the same camera used to detect the biometric of the individual . While this latter embodiment may be less efficient than others e.g. by involving an analysis of a representation of the device such as an image it may have particular advantages e.g. by facilitating the detection of a device that is not capable of or configured to communicate with the device detector . As a second example these types of device detectors may also be capable of detecting many types of devices including mobile phones pagers mobile computer such as a palmtop laptop or tablet computer global positioning system GPS receivers gaming devices cameras audio or video players implanted medical devices e.g. a pacemaker or cochlear implant and even devices lacking an independent power source such as radiofrequency identifier RFID chips embedded in an identification card such as a bank card or credit card solid state data storage chips and Subscriber Identity Module SIM cards inserted in a mobile phone. As a third example many types of device identifiers may be identified with respect to such devices including a distinctive identifier e.g. a Globally Unique Identifier GUID that definitively differentiates the device from every other device a device type of the device such as an instance of a particular model of devices e.g. a brand or model of a mobile phone and a device class of the device such as the general properties and or capabilities of the device e.g. an identification of a device as a mobile phone .

As a third variation of this first aspect many types of associations may be utilized to associate a device with an individual . As a first example the association may be identified based on the proximity of the device to the individual e.g. detecting the device on the person of or in a close proximity with the individual . As a second example the association may be identified based on an explicit association e.g. in addition to its device identifier the device may identify the individual who is authorized to use the device . As a third example the association may be identified based on correlation e.g. even if the device is not proximate to the individual the correlated presence and absence of the device and the individual at similar times may indicate the association . For example the device may comprise a vehicle driven by the individual and even if the computer may be unable to identify the occupants of the vehicle e.g. the device detector may comprise a license plate reader that monitors entry and exit of automobiles from a parking lot the computer may be able to correlate the presence of a device with the presence of one or more individuals e.g. individuals who are often detected at the same times that the vehicle is present in the parking lot and therefore identify an association of the device with the individual . As a fourth example the association may also be sporadic e.g. an individual may occasionally carry the device and or consistent e.g. an implanted medical device and the computer may accordingly adjust the evidentiary weight of the detected presence or absence of the device while identifying the individual . As a fifth example an individual may also have associations with two or more devices either in the alternative e.g. an individual may drive one of two vehicles or cumulative e.g. the individual often carries two or more devices either independently or together . As a sixth example a device may be shared by two or more individuals and may therefore be associated with both individual identities .

As a fourth variation of this first aspect these techniques may identify an individual with the cooperation of the individual e.g. a user who wishes to login to the computer or without the cooperation of the individual e.g. a hostile prisoner . These techniques may also be utilized overtly e.g. by notifying the individual of the automated identification and possibly including the cooperation of the individual or covertly e.g. by clandestinely positioning the biometric detector and or the device detector in a concealed location or at a long range from the individual . Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many scenarios wherein the techniques presented herein may be utilized.

A second aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the registration of the individual identity of an individual comprising at least one biometric and at least one device identifier . As a first variation of this second aspect the computer may receive biometrics and or device identifiers from another source and may subsequently utilize this data as individual identities to identify individuals . Alternatively the computer may also be configured to generate individual identities e.g. upon receiving an individual identity registration request to register the individual identity of the individual from the individual and or another user of the computer . As a first such example the computer may passively wait until such a registration request is received and may then activate the biometric detector and or the device detector to detect the biometrics and or device identifiers of the device . As a second such example the computer may spontaneously initiate the registration of an individual identity of an individual e.g. by sporadically or continuously detecting biometrics and or device identifiers and initiating the registration upon identifying a biometric and or device identifier that is not associated with an individual identity in the data store e.g. by searching the data store upon detecting the biometric or device identifier and upon not finding a corresponding individual identity storing a new individual identity in the data store . This registration process may be initiated automatically and or may be contingent upon the consent of the individual or another user e.g. the computer may present to the individual an offer to generate an individual identity for the individual and or to associate an identified device with the individual identity of the individual and only proceeding upon receiving from the individual an acceptance of the offer . As a third such example the computer may separately scan for unrecognized devices and may seek to associate newly detected devices with one or more individuals e.g. upon detecting a device identifier and failing to find an individual identity in the data store associated with the device identifier the computer may ask one or more individuals having an individual identity e.g. the individuals who are currently present to claim the device and may associate the device identifier of the device with the individual identity of any individual who sends a claim to the device to the computer .

A third aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the identification of individuals based on the biometrics and device identifiers associated with various individual identities representing various individuals . As a first variation of this second aspect the identification may begin upon request of the individual or another user of the computer e.g. the computer may deactivate the biometric detector and or device detector until receiving a request to identify an individual . Alternatively the computer may utilize the biometric detector and or the device detector to detect a presence of an individual e.g. a light sensor configured to detect when an individual steps in front of a camera and may spontaneously initiate the identification of the individual . A combination of these techniques may also be utilized e.g. upon detecting a presence of an individual the computer may present to the individual an offer to initiate an identification process involving various biometrics . The computer may also be configured to upon identifying an individual notify the individual that the identification has been achieved.

As a second variation of this third aspect the detected biometrics and or device identifiers may be utilized in any order and or combination. As a first such example the computer may concurrently detect one or more biometrics and one or more device identifiers which may be generated in a different order based on various circumstances e.g. based upon varying complexity of the analyses of respective representations and upon receiving each such identifier may incrementally whittle down the set of individuals having individual identities in the individual identity set that correspond to the detected identifiers. This example may be advantageous e.g. by concurrently invoking all of the identification capabilities of the computer in order to achieve a rapid identification of the individual . As a second such example the computer may utilize the detection of biometrics and or device identifiers in a particular order. For example the computer may invoke a sequence of identification by first detecting more accurate more efficient and or more diagnostic identifiers and may differentially select other identifiers to narrow down the subset of individual identities . As another such example the computer may first detect a device identifier of the individual . Upon identifying only one individual identity associated with the device identifier the computer may identify one or more biometrics of the individual to verify this individual identity e.g. to verify that another individual is not simply carrying the device of another individual . Alternatively upon identifying two or more individuals who are associated with the device e.g. two or more individual identities comprising the device identifier of the device the computer may use biometrics to differentiating the individuals in order to identify the individual . For example if two individuals are associated with a particular device that is detected in association with an unidentified individual the computer may endeavor to select a biometric that efficiently and accurately differentiates these two individuals . The computer may then invoke the corresponding biometric detector to detect the biometric of the unidentified individual and may therefore identify the unidentified individual according to one or neither of the individual identities . These examples may involve a longer duration due to invoking identification techniques sequentially but may reduce the invocation of some identifying components that may be unnecessary to identify the individual thereby conserving computing resources and or the privacy of the individual e.g. by not utilizing a potentially sensitive biometric identification that may not be necessary .

As a third variation of this third aspect a device detector may have a variable device detector range e.g. a Wi Fi receiver may apply more or less power to an antenna in order to increase or decrease the range of device detection and or may be configured only to detect devices within a certain proximity to the computer . The computer may therefore upon receiving from an individual a device detector range accordingly set the device detector range of the device detector.

As a fourth variation of this third aspect the computer may include an individual whitelist which may identify one or more individual identities that are to be searched before other individual identities . For example the computer may be more often patronized or the area of the detection may be more heavily frequented by a particular subset of individuals among the set of individuals for which the computer has individual identities . The computer may therefore present an improved user experience by upon detecting one or more biometrics of an unidentified individual first searching the individual identities referenced by the individual whitelist in order to recognize such individuals faster and may only search the other individual identities if the detected biometrics and or device identifiers are not associated with any individual identity included in the individual whitelist.

As a fifth variation of this third aspect the computer may include a device blacklist which may identify one or more blacklisted devices that are not to be identified and or utilized in the identification of any individual . For example a device may publicly or communally utilized e.g. a portable device that is available to many or any individual in a public space and while the identification of other devices may promote the identification of associated individuals the presence of this particular device may only reduce the accuracy of the identification of individuals . Accordingly when the computer detects one or more device identifiers the computer may search the device blacklist and may only include in the identification process device identifiers that are not identified in the device blacklist. Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many variations in the identification of individuals using biometrics and device identifiers in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

A fourth aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to tracking the presence of an individual who has been identified using biometrics and device identifiers . An individual may be identified as present in a particular area e.g. a proximity to the computer one or more biometric detectors and or one or more device detectors . However as the individual moves about within the area the identification of the individual using these components may fluctuate. Nevertheless it may be possible to track the persistent presence of the individual within the area using the continued detection of biometrics and or device identifiers .

Within the area of the exemplary scenario of the computer may endeavor to detect and identify various individuals . For example when a presence of a first individual within the biometric detector range is detected by the camera biometrics and device identifiers may be collected and the first individual may be identified as the individual having the name Drew Stone. Additionally a visible presence indicator may be recorded in the individual identity of this individual to indicate that the individual is currently present and visible to the computer within the area. However the individual may eventually move to a different location within the area and the computer may no longer detect the biometrics of the individual within the biometric detector range . However the persistent presence of the individual may continue to be tracked due to the continued detection of the device identifier . For example a second individual may initially appeared within the biometric detector range and may have been identified as the individual named Mike Jones but the individual may have since moved to a different area. Nevertheless the device identifier of a device carried by the second individual may continue to be detected within the device detector range of the device detector . Accordingly in the individual identity set the visible presence indicator stored in the individual identity of this individual may be replaced with a present presence indicator to indicate that although the individual is no longer visible to the camera of the computer the presence of the individual in the area is still detected. Finally when an individual who has been previously identified such as a third individual having the name Kim Davis departs both the biometric detector range and the device detector range the computer may replace the present presence indicator in the individual identity of this individual with an absent presence indicator to indicate the departure of the individual from the area. In this manner the various detectors of the computer may interoperate to track the persistence presence of individuals in an area despite the fluctuating visibility of such individuals to the biometric detector s and or the device detector s . Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many ways of tracking the presence of identified individuals in accordance with the techniques presented herein.
