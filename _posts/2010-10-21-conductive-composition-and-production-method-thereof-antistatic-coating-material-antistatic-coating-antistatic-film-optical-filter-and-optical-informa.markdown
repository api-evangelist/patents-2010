The present invention relates to a conductive composition containing a conjugated conductive polymer and production method thereof. The present invention further relates to an antistatic coating material for imparting antistatic properties to a film an antistatic coating material having antistatic properties an antistatic film used in wrapping materials of food and electronic parts an optical filter used for the front surface of a liquid crystal display and a plasma display and an optical information recording medium such as CDs and DVDs. The present invention relates to capacitors such as an aluminum electrolytic capacitor tantalum electrolytic capacitor and niobium electrolytic capacitor and a production method thereof.

 conjugated conductive polymers are known as organic conductive materials. The conjugated conductive polymers is generally referred to an organic polymer composed of the main chain of a conjugated system and examples of the conjugated conductive polymers include polypyrroles polythiophenes polyacetylenes polyphenylenes polyphenylene vinylenes polyanilines polyacenes polythiophene vinylenes and copolymers thereof. These conjugated conductive polymers are usually synthesized by an electrolytic polymerization method or a chemical oxidative polymerization method.

In the electrolytic polymerization method a previously prepared base such as an electrode material is immersed in a mixed solution of an electrolyte as a dopant and precursor monomers for constituting a conjugated conductive polymer to form a film of the conjugated conductive polymer on the base. Therefore mass production is very difficult.

On the other hand there are no such limitations on the chemical oxidative polymerization method. A large amount of a conjugated conductive polymer can be produced in a solution by adding oxidant and oxidation polymerization catalysis to precursor monomers of the conjugated conductive polymer.

However the conjugated conductive polymer is obtained as an insoluble solid powder in the chemical oxidative polymerization method because the polymer becomes less soluble in a solvent as the conjugated system of the main chain of the polymer grows. It is difficult to form a uniform film of a conjugated conductive polymer on a base surface if the polymer is insoluble. Additionally the conjugated conductive polymer tends to be an amorphous block and then a conductive composition containing the conjugated conductive polymer has low conductivity.

Therefore some methods to solubilize the conjugated conductive polymers have been attempted. They are a method of introducing a functional group into the polymers a method of dispersing the polymers in a binder resin and a method of adding an anion group containing polymeric acid to the polymer.

For example a method of preparing an aqueous solution of poly 3 4 dialkoxythiophene by the chemical oxidative polymerization of 3 4 dialkoxythiophene using oxidant in the presence of polystyrene sulfonic acid which is an anion group containing polymeric acid having a molecular weight of 2000 to 500000 in order to improve the dispersibility in water is disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 2636968. A method of preparing an aqueous colloid solution of a conjugated conductive polymer by chemical oxidative polymerization of a precursor monomer of the polymer in the presence of polyacrylic acid is disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application First Publication No. 7 165892.

According to methods disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 2636968 and Japanese Unexamined Patent Application First Publication No. 7 165892 an aqueous dispersion solution containing a conjugated conductive polymer can be easily prepared. These methods require a conjugated conductive polymer to contain a large amount of anion group containing polymeric acid for ensuring its dispersibility. Therefore the problem occurs that the obtained conductive compositions contain a large amount of compounds which do not contribute to conductivity making it difficult to achieve high conductivity.

In the chemical oxidative polymerization method high oxidative oxidants cause unfavorable side reactions in high probability during chemical oxidative polymerization. Therefore polymer structures having poor conjugated properties may be produced the produced polymer may be excessively oxidized or impurity ions may remain in the obtained polymer causing low conductivity and long term stability of the obtained conjugated conductive polymer. In addition since the conjugated conductive polymer is a highly oxidized state it is considered that radicals will be formed by oxidative degradation of a portion of the polymer due to the external environment such as heat and then degradation progresses according to a radical chain reaction.

Resin films themselves are insulators and easily electrically charged. Furthermore resin films tend to charge static electricity by friction or the like. Moreover static electricity is not easily removed but rather accumulates causing various problems.

Particularly when a resin film is used for food packaging material emphasizing sanitary properties dust and dirt are absorbed in display the appearance is significantly impaired and in some cases the commodity value is lowered. When resin film is used for packaging a powder charged powder is absorbed or repulsed in its packaging or use and therefore causes the inconvenience that handling of the powder becomes difficult. When a precision electronic part is packaged with a resin film it is a feared that the precision electronic part is damaged by the static electricity therefore the occurrence of static electricity must always be prevented.

Moreover it is desirable that the surface of an optical filter or an optical information recording medium has high hardness and high transparency as well as antistatic properties to prevent the adherence of dust and dirt due to the static electricity. Particularly it is desired that the surface resistance of the antistatic property be in the region of about 10to 10 and that the resistance stabilizes i.e. stabilized antistatic properties from which antistatic coating having antistatic properties and high hardness is provided on the surface of optical filter or optical information recording medium. In order to impart antistatic properties for example a method for coating a resin film or a surfactant on the surface and a method for kneading a surfactant into a resin forming a resin film or an antistatic coating have been adopted for example see Fine Chemical Antistatic Agents Latest Market Trend the first volume Vol. 16 No. 15 1987 p. 24 36 published by CMC .

However electrostatic prevention based on this surfactant has the drawback that its conduction mechanism is one of ion conduction therefore it is easily affected by humidity conductivity increases by high humidity however conductivity decreases by low humidity. Therefore the antistatic function deteriorates and antistatic performance is not displayed as necessary in an environment where the humidity is low and especially static electricity easily occurs.

If a metal or carbon with electron conduction as conduction mechanism is used such humidity dependence disappears but these materials are totally opaque and not applicable for purposes requiring the transparency.

Moreover a metal oxide such as ITO Indium Tin Oxide has transparency and adopts the electron conduction as a conduction mechanism therefore it is suited in this respect but a process using a sputtering apparatus must used for its film forming Not only is the process complicated but also the manufacturing cost rises. A coating film of inorganic metal oxide has low flexibility. When a film is formed on a thin base film the coating film may be broken and does not exhibit conductivity. In addition it is feared that peeling occurs at the interface and the transparency reduces because the adhesion to the base being an organic substance is low.

Moreover conjugated conductive polymers are known as organic materials with electron conduction as the conduction mechanism but the conjugated conductive polymers generally have insoluble and infusible properties and it is difficult to coat the polymers on a base film after polymerization. Accordingly it has been attempted that aniline be polymerized in the presence of a polymeric acid with a sulfo group polyanion to form a water soluble polyaniline the obtained mixture is used coated on a base film and then dried e.g. see Japanese Unexamined Patent Application First Publication No. 1 254764 .

However as with the method described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application First Publication No. 1 254764 if aniline is directly polymerized on a base an antistatic coating can be formed. In this case the antistatic coating has low conductivity because the coating is not obtained by a conjugated conductive homopolymer and the adhesion to a resin base is low and manufacturing processes are also complicated because the antistatic coating is water soluble.

In recent years it has been required to reduce the impedance of capacitors used for electronics in a high frequency region with the digitalization of electronics. A so called functional capacitor in which an oxide film of valve metals such as aluminum tantalum and niobium is adopted as a dielectric and a conjugated conductive polymer is formed on this surface and used as a cathode and thus far has been used in response to this requirement.

As shown in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application First Publication No. 2003 37024 it is general that the structure of this functional capacitor has an anode consisting of a porous valve metal body a dielectric layer formed by oxidizing the surface of anode and a cathode obtained by laminating a solid electrolyte layer a carbon layer and a silver layer on the dielectric layer. The solid electrolyte layer of the capacitor is a layer constructed from a conjugated conductive polymer of pyrrole thiophene and the like and the layer performs to penetrate into the inside of porous body come into contact with a larger area of electrolyte layer to derive a high capacity restore defects of the dielectric layer and prevent leakage of a current.

An electrolytic polymerization method see Japanese Unexamined Patent Application First Publication No. 63 158829 and a chemical oxidative polymerization method see Japanese Unexamined Patent Application First Publication No. 63 173313 have been widely known as methods for forming the conjugated conductive polymers.

However the electrolytic polymerization method has the problem that a conductive layer made of manganese oxide must be formed on the surface of the porous valve metal body beforehand the process is complicated and further the manganese oxide has low conductivity and weakens the effect of using the conjugated conductive polymers having high conductivity.

The chemical oxidative polymerization method has the problem that the polymerization time is long the polymerization must be repeated to ensure the thickness the production efficiency of capacitors is low and the conductivity is also low.

Accordingly a method wherein conductive polymers are not formed by the electrolytic polymerization method and the chemical oxidative polymerization method see Japanese Unexamined Patent Application First Publication No. 7 105718 has been proposed. A method comprising the steps of polymerizing aniline while allowing a polymeric acid with a sulfo group or carboxy group to coexist to prepare a water soluble polyaniline applying the aqueous solution of polyaniline on a dielectric layer and then drying has been described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application First Publication No. 7 105718. This method is simple but the permeability for the inside of porous body of the polyaniline solution deteriorates the conductivity is low because the polymeric acid other than the conjugated conductive polymer is contained and the humidity dependence on conductivity by the effect of polymeric acid may also be observed.

A capacitor having a low equivalent series resistance ESR as index of impedance has been desired and the conductivity of the solid electrolyte layer must be increased to decrease ESR. As a method for increasing the conductivity of the solid electrolyte layer for example it has been proposed to highly control conditions for the chemical oxidative polymerization method see Japanese Unexamined Patent Application First Publication No. 11 74157 . However in the production method the complex chemical oxidative polymerization method is more complicated in many cases thus the simplification and low costing of processes cannot be realized.

Moreover such an antistatic coating material produces the antistatic coating at a low cost because a sufficient antistatic property is obtained by using it in a small amount.

The conductive composition of the present invention comprises a conjugated conductive polymer a polyanion and a hydroxy group containing aromatic compound containing two or more hydroxy groups.

The conjugated conductive polymers can be used if they are organic polymers in which the main chain is constructed by a conjugate system. Examples of the polymer include polypyrroles polythiophenes polyacetylenes polyphenylenes polyphenylene vinylenes polyanilines polyacenes polythiophene vinylenes and copolymers thereof. Polypyrroles polythiophenes and polyanilines are preferable from in view of ease of polymerization and stability in the air.

The conjugated conductive polymers can be obtained sufficient conductivity and compatibility for binder resins as they are unsubstituted but it is preferable that functional groups such as alkyl carboxyl sulfo alkoxy hydroxyl and cyano groups are introduced into the conjugated conductive polymers to increase the conductivity and dispersibility or solubility for binder resins.

Examples of the conjugated conductive polymer specifically include polypyrrole poly 3 methylpyrrole poly N methylpyrrole poly 3 ethylpyrrole poly 3 n propylpyrrole poly 3 butylpyrrole poly 3 octylpyrrole poly 3 decylpyrrole poly 3 dodecylpyrrole poly 3 4 dimethylpyrrole poly 3 4 dibutylpyrrole poly 3 carboxypyrrole poly 3 methyl 4 carboxypyrrole poly 3 methyl 4 carboxyethylpyrrole poly 3 methyl 4 carboxybutylpyrrole poly 3 hydroxypyrrole poly 3 methoxypyrrole poly 3 ethoxypyrrole poly 3 butoxypyrrole poly 3 hexyloxypyrrole poly 3 methyl 4 hexyloxypyrrole polythiophene poly 3 methylthiophene poly 3 ethylthiophene poly 3 propylthiophene poly 3 butylthiophene poly 3 hexylthiophene poly 3 heptylthiophene poly 3 octylthiophene poly 3 decylthiophene poly 3 dodecylthiophene poly 3 octadecylthiophene poly 3 bromothiophene poly 3 chlorothiophene poly 3 iodothiophene poly 3 cyanothiophene poly 3 phenylthiophene poly 3 4 dimethylthiophene poly 3 4 dibutylthiophene poly 3 hydroxythiophene poly 3 methoxythiophene poly 3 ethoxythiophene poly 3 butoxythiophene poly 3 hexyloxythiophene poly 3 heptyloxythiophene poly 3 octyloxythiophene poly 3 decyloxythiophene poly 3 dodecyloxythiophene poly 3 octadecyloxythiophene poly 3 4 dihydroxythiophene poly 3 4 dimethoxythiophene poly 3 4 diethoxythiophene poly 3 4 dipropoxythiophene poly 3 4 dibutoxythiophene poly 3 4 dihexyloxythiophene poly 3 4 diheptyloxythiophene poly 3 4 dioctyloxythiophene poly 3 4 didecyloxythiophene poly 3 4 didodecyloxythiophene poly 3 4 ethylenedioxythiophene poly 3 4 propylenedioxythiophene poly 3 4 butenedioxythiophene poly 3 methyl 4 methoxythiophene poly 3 methyl 4 ethoxythiophene poly 3 carboxythiophene poly 3 methyl 4 carboxythiophene poly 3 methyl 4 carboxyethylthiophene poly 3 methyl 4 carboxybutylthiophene polyaniline poly 2 methylaniline poly 3 isobutylaniline poly 2 anilinesulfonic acid poly 3 anilinesulfonic acid and the like.

Among these polymers a co polymer composed of one or two compounds selected from polypyrrole polythiophene poly N methylpyrrol poly 3 methylthiophene poly 3 4 ethylenedioxythiophene is suitably used in view of resistance value and reactivity. Polypyrrole and poly 3 4 ethylenedioxythiophene are more preferable in view of increasing the conductivity and improving the heat resistance.

Moreover alkyl substituted compounds such as poly N methylpyrrol and poly 3 methylthiophene are more preferable because the solvent solubility compatibility for binder resins and dispersibility are improved. In the alkyl groups methyl group is preferable because it does not exert an adverse effect on the conductivity. Furthermore poly 3 4 ethylenedioxythiophene doped with polystyrene sulfonate abbreviated as PEDOT PSS is preferable in that the transparency after forming the coating film becomes favorable because it has higher heat stability and low degree of polymerization.

The above conjugated conductive polymers can be easily produced by chemical oxidative polymerization of precursor monomers forming conjugated conductive polymers in the presence of an appropriate oxidant an oxidation catalyst and a polyanion dopant described later.

A precursor monomer has a conjugate system in a molecule and forms the conjugate system in the main chain when it is polymerized by the function of an appropriate oxidant.

In these polymers substituted or unsubstituted butenylens are preferable from the fact that an interaction between an unsaturated bond and a conjugated conductive polymer exists and substituted or unsubstituted butadienes are easily synthesized as starting materials.

Examples of polyimides include polyimides from anhydrides such as pyromellitic dianhydride biphenyltetracarboxylic dianhydride benzophenone tetracarboxylic dianhydride 2 2 3 3 tetracarboxyphenyl ether dianhydride and 2 2 4 4 di dicarboxyphenyloxy phenyl propane dianhydride and diamines such as oxydiamine p phenylenediamine m phenylenediamine and benzophenonediamine.

When polyanions have substituents examples of substituents include alkyl hydroxyl amino carboxyl cyano phenyl phenol ester alkoxy groups and the like. If solubility for solvents heat resistance and compatibility with resins are considered alkyl hydroxyl phenol and ester groups are preferable.

Alkyl groups can increase solubility for and dispersibility in polar solvents or nonpolar solvents and compatibility with and dispersibility in resins. Hydroxyl groups can easily form a hydrogen bond with another hydrogen atom and increase solubility for organic solvents and compatibility with dispersibility for and adhesion to resins.

Any anion group among polyanions can be used if the anion group can be doped with the conjugated conductive polymer by chemical oxidation and preferred examples include a mono substituted sulfuric acid ester group mono substituted phosphoric acid ester group phosphoric group carboxy group and sulfo groups in view of easy production and stability. Furthermore a sulfo group mono substituted phosphoric acid ester group carboxy group and the like are more preferable in view of the doping effect of the functional groups to the conjugated conductive polymers.

Preferred anion groups are provided in the main chain of polyanions adjacently or at a constant interval.

Among these polyanions polystyrene sulfonic acid polyisoprene sulfonic acid polyethyl acrylate sulfonic acid polybutyl acrylate sulfonic acid are preferable from effects of increasing compatibility with binder resins further increasing conductivity of resultant antistatic coating material and suppressing thermal decomposition of the conjugated conductive polymers.

Examples of production methods of polyanions include a method wherein an anion group is directly introduced into a polymer free of an anion group with an acid a method wherein a polymer free of an anion group is sulfonated with a sulfonating agent and a method wherein a polymer is produced by polymerization of an anion group containing polymerizable monomer.

Since each conductive composition antistatic coating material and solid electrolyte layer of a capacitor contains a hydroxy group containing aromatic compound high conductivity and heat resistance are shown. It is considered that these properties can be obtained for the following reasons.

Since the conjugated conductive polymer is in a highly oxidized state it is considered that radicals will be formed by oxidative degradation of a portion of the polymer due to the external environment such as heat and then degradation progresses according to a radical chain reaction. On the other hand the hydroxy group containing aromatic compound has a strong interaction between the hydroxy groups and the aromatic ring and tends to release hydrogen from the compound. Therefore hydrogen released from the hydroxy group containing aromatic compound can deactivate radicals formed by oxidative degradation of the conjugated conductive polymer. Accordingly the radical chain reaction is stopped and progression of degradation is suppressed and thus the heat resistance and stability should be high. This effect occurs when the aromatic compound contains two or more hydroxy groups.

The hydroxy group containing aromatic compound tends to interact with anion groups in the polyanion. It is considered that this interaction can shorten the distance between polyanions and accordingly the distance between the conjugated conductive polymers adsorbed on the polyanion by doping each other can be also shortened. As a result the energy for hopping which is an electric conduction phenomenon between conjugated conductive polymers is reduced and thus the total electric resistance can be reduced conductivity can increase .

An example of a production method of a conductive composition according to the present invention is explained.

In the production method of a conductive composition of this example first in a polymerization step a precursor monomer forming a conjugated conductive polymer is dispersed or dissolved in a solvent in the presence of a polyanion to polymerize by a chemical oxidative polymerization. Specifically a polyanion a precursor monomer and an oxidant and or oxidative polymerization catalyst for polymerizing the precursor monomer by the chemical oxidative polymerization are prepared. The precursor monomer and oxidant and or oxidative polymerization catalyst are added to the polyanion maintained at a constant temperature and are reacted for a predetermined time while stirring to polymerize the precursor monomer by the chemical oxidative polymerization. An operation method a sequence of the operation reaction conditions and the like are not limited in the polymerization step.

A mixed solution having a predetermined concentration may be prepared by adding a solvent to the polyanion precursor monomer oxidant and or oxidative polymerization catalyst beforehand.

When the conjugated conductive polymer is polymerized by the chemical oxidative polymerization the main chain of the conjugated conductive polymer grows along the main chain of the polyanion and then the conjugated conductive polymer forms a bipolaron structure under the highly oxidized conditions. Accordingly it is considered that anion groups of the polyanion are doped with the conjugated conductive polymer to form a salt of the polyanion and the conjugated conductive polymer. When the polyanion has sulfo groups a salt of the polyanion strongly bonding with the conjugated conductive polymer can be formed. Since the conjugated conductive polymer is strongly attracted to the main chain of the polyanion the conjugated conductive polymer arranged with regularity by growing along the main chain of the polyanion can be easily obtained.

In the polymerization step a mixed solution containing the polyanion and the conjugated conductive polymer is obtained.

A reaction terminator to stop the polymerization reaction may be added if necessary after the polymerization step has been completed. Furthermore excess oxidant and or oxidative polymerization catalyst and reaction by products may be removed and ion exchange may be carried out after the polymerization step has been completed.

Next in an addition step a predetermined amount of a hydroxy group containing aromatic compound is added in the mixed solution obtained in the polymerization step and mixed so as to form a uniform solution.

As an addition process of the hydroxy group containing aromatic compound a process for adding the hydroxy group containing aromatic compound as it is and a process for adding a solution in which the hydroxy group containing aromatic compound is dissolved or dispersed in a solvent are exemplified. In view of the ease of mixing with the above described mixed solution the process for adding a solution in which the hydroxy group containing aromatic compound is dissolved or dispersed in a solvent is preferred. Solvents for dissolving or dispersing the hydroxy group containing aromatic compound are not especially limited and the above described solvents can be used. Solvents may differ from the solvent used in the mixed solution.

Subsequently in a filtration step a conductive composition is obtained by partially removing free ions by an ultrafiltration method. In the production method of the conductive composition of the present invention the filtration step is an optional step and may be omitted.

In the ultrafiltration method a polymer membrane an ultrafiltration membrane formed with a constant bore diameter is provided on a porous material and the solution is circulated. The ultrafiltration membrane is inserted to produce a differential pressure between the circulated solution and the permeated solution therefore a part of solution at the circulated solution side penetrates to the permeated solution side and releases the pressure at the circulated solution side. Particles smaller than the bore diameter of the ultrafiltration membrane and a part of the dissolved ions or the like contained in the circulated solution are transferred to the permeated solution side based on the above phenomenon to be removed. This method is a dilution method and impurities can be easily removed by repeating this dilution.

The ultrafiltration membrane to be used is suitably selected depending upon the diameter of particles to be removed and ion species and an ultrafiltration membrane having a range of molecular weight cut off of 1000 to 100000 is preferably used.

Since the obtained conjugated conductive polymer contains a grown conjugate system in the main chain conjugated conductive polymers generally have insoluble and infusible properties. In the conjugated conductive polymer solution obtained by dissolution or dispersion since the conjugated conductive polymer is self coordinated by removing solvents heating doping or the like when forming a film the conjugated conductive polymer may be insoluble. Therefore solvents should be appropriately selected.

The above described production method of the conductive composition comprises a polymerization step for polymerizing a precursor monomer forming a conjugated conductive polymer in the presence of polyanion by a chemical oxidative polymerization and an addition step for adding a hydroxy group containing aromatic compound and then a conductive composition comprising the conjugated conductive polymer the polyanion and the hydroxy group containing aromatic compound is obtained. Since the conductive composition comprises the hydroxy group containing aromatic compound superior conductivity and stability are shown.

To produce an antistatic coating material first a polyanion is dissolved in a solvent for dissolving it a precursor monomer of a conjugated conductive polymer and as necessary a dopant are added and fully stirred and mixed. Next an oxidant is added dropwise into the obtained mixture to advance a polymerization and obtain complexes of the polyanion and conjugated conductive polymer. Subsequently the oxidant residual monomer and by products are removed from the complexes to purify and then dissolved in an appropriate solvent. A hydroxy group containing aromatic compound and as necessary a dopant and a binder resin are added to obtain an antistatic coating material.

Purification methods are not specially limited for example reprecipitation method ultrafiltration method or the like can be used. Among these the ultrafiltration method is simple and thus preferable. The ultrafiltration method is a method wherein a liquid in a solution is permeated and filtered through a porous ultrafiltration membrane while circulating the solution on the ultrafiltration membrane. In this method the ultrafiltration membrane is inserted to produce a differential pressure between the circulated solution and the permeated solution therefore a part of solution at the circulated solution side penetrates to the permeated solution side and release the pressure at the circulated solution side. Particles smaller than the bore diameter of the ultrafiltration membrane and a part of dissolved ions transfer to the permeated solution side according to the penetration of this circulated solution. Therefore these particles and dissolved ions can be removed. The ultrafiltration membrane to be used is properly selected depending upon diameter of particles to be removed and ion species and the ultrafiltration membrane having a range of molecular weight cut off of 1000 to 100000 is preferably used.

An antistatic coating is formed by applying an antistatic coating material on a base. Examples of methods for applying the antistatic coating material include dipping comma coating spray coating roll coating gravure printing and the like. Bases are not specially limited and resin moldings easy to cause static electricity especially resin films such as polyester film triacetyl cellulose TAC film and the like are suitable.

After the application the solvent is removed by heating or the coating may be cured by heat or light. As heating methods in case of heating for example common methods such as hot air heating or infrared heating can be adopted. As methods for irradiating a light in case of forming a coating film by photohardening for example a method for irradiating ultraviolet ray from light sources such as ultrahigh pressure mercury vapor lamp high pressure mercury vapor lamp low pressure mercury vapor lamp carbon arc xenon arc metal halide lamp and the like can be adopted.

Since the antistatic coating comprises the hydroxy group containing aromatic compound the conductivity remarkably increases and the degradation of the conjugated conductive polymer is suppressed.

More specifically the conductivity is about 0.001 to 100 S cm when no hydroxy group containing aromatic compound is contained on the other hand the conductivity is about 10 to 2000 S cm when a hydroxy group containing aromatic compound is contained.

When the antistatic coating is used in an optical field especially used for an optical filter and an optical information recording medium described later the transparency is preferably high. More specifically the total light transmittance JIS Z 8701 is preferably 85 or above more preferably 90 or above and especially preferably 96 or above.

The haze JIS K 6714 is preferably 5 or below more preferably 3 or below and especially preferably 1 or below.

The surface hardness pencil hardness of the antistatic coating is preferably HB or harder when the antistatic coating also serves as a hard coat layer. The pencil hardness can be adjusted by the thickness of coating film.

It is preferable that the surface resistance of the antistatic coating is properly adjusted in accordance with optical characteristics. Usually if the surface resistance is about 1 10 to 1 10 it is applicable to the antistatic purpose.

The light transmittance haze and surface resistance of the coating film can be adjusted by the thickness of the coating film.

The total light transmittance haze and surface resistance of the coating film can be adjusted by the thickness of the antistatic coating. It is preferable that a binder resin is not contained when a low surface resistance value is desired. However it is preferable that a binder resin is contained to lower the cost or improve the adhesion to a base.

An antistatic film has a film base and the above antistatic coating formed on at least one side of the film base.

Examples of film bases include low density polyethylene film high density polyethylene film ethylene propylene copolymer film polypropylene film ethylene vinylacetate copolymer film ethylene methyl methacrylate copolymer film polyethylene terephthalate PET film polybutylene terephthalate PBT film polyethylene naphthalate PEN film polyimide film 6 nylon film 6 6 nylon film polymethyl methacrylate film polystyrene film styrene acrylonitrile butadiene copolymer film polyacrylonitrile film cellulose triacetate TAC film cellulose propionate film polyvinyl chloride film polyvinylidene chloride film polyvinylidene fluoride film polytetrafluoroethylene film polyvinyl alcohol film ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer film polycarbonate film polysulfone film polyether sulfone film polyether ether ketone film polyphenylene oxide film and the like.

The surface of these film bases are usually oleophilic when an antistatic coating material dissolved in an aqueous solvent is applied the application is difficult. Therefore when an antistatic coating material dissolved in an aqueous solvent is applied it is preferable to give etching treatments such as sputtering corona discharge flame ultraviolet irradiation electron ray irradiation chemical reaction oxidation and the like or hydrophilic treatments such as primer coating and the like. Moreover the surface may also be dust removed and cleaned by solvent washing ultrasonic washing or the like.

The optical filter of this embodiment example is shown in . This optical filter comprises a film base an antistatic coating formed on the film base and an antireflecting layer formed on the antistatic coating . The antistatic coating in this optical filter functions as a hard coat layer.

When the optical filter is provided on the surface of a display a transparent adhesive layer is provided on the surface of the film base in the optical filter and the optical filter and the surface of the display are provided via the adhesive layer. Various plastic films having transparency can be used as the film base . Examples of the transparent plastic films include films made of polyethylene terephthalate polyimide polyether sulfone polyether ether ketone polycarbonate polypropylene polyamide acrylamide cellulose propionate and the like.

Moreover it is preferable that etching treatments such as sputtering corona discharge flame ultraviolet irradiation electron ray irradiation chemical reaction oxidation and the like or hydrophilic treatments such as primer coating are given to the surface of film base . If such treatments are given to the surface the adhesion to the antistatic coating can be further increased.

Furthermore the surface of film base may also be dust removed or cleaned by solvent washing ultrasonic washing or the like as necessary before the antistatic coating .

The antistatic coating is a membrane formed from an antistatic coating material as described above and the membrane functions as a hard coat layer. Accordingly as described above the surface hardness pencil hardness of this antistatic coating is preferably HB or harder. The total light transmittance JIS Z 8701 of antistatic coating is preferably 85 or above more preferably 90 or above and especially preferably 96 or above for optical purposes. The haze JIS K 6714 is preferably 5 or below more preferably 3 or below and especially preferably 1 or below.

The antireflecting layer is a layer for preventing the reflection of light. This layer may be a single layer or a multilayer. In case of a single layer the refractive index is preferably in a range of 1.38 to 1.45 and the thickness of optical film is preferably in a range of 80 to 100 nm.

The antireflecting layer can be formed by either dry processes or wet processes. Examples of dry processes include physical deposition processes such as electron beam vapor deposition process dielectric heating vapor deposition process resistance heating vapor deposition process sputtering process ion plating process and the like and plasma CVD process. When the antireflecting layer is formed by the dry processes for example inorganic compounds such as silicon oxide magnesium fluoride niobium oxide titanium oxide tantalum oxide aluminum oxide zirconium oxide indium oxide tin oxide and the like can be used as components of the antireflecting layer .

As wet processes for example processes wherein a coating containing curable compounds is applied by well known methods such as comma coating spray coating roll coating gravure printing and the like are given. When the antireflecting layer is formed by the wet processes for example fluorine compounds such as fluorine containing organic compounds fluorine containing organosilicon compounds fluorine containing inorganic compounds and the like can be used as a curable compound.

In the optical filter an antifouling layer may be further provided on the antireflecting layer . If the antifouling layer is provided it prevents the adherence of dust and dirt or facilitates to remove dust and dirt even if they adhere to.

The antifouling layer is not specially limited if it does not hinder the antireflection function of the antireflecting layer can show high water repellence and high oil repellence and prevent the adherence of contaminants. The antifouling layer may be a layer made of organic compounds or a layer made of inorganic compounds. For example a layer containing organosilicon compounds with a perfluorosilane group or a fluorocycloalkyl group or a layer containing organofluorine compounds can be used.

The processes for forming the antifouling layer can be properly selected according to their kinds for example physical vapor deposition processes or chemical vapor deposition processes such as deposition process sputtering process ion plating process vacuum processes such as plasma polymerization process microgravure process screen coating process dip coating process and the like can be adopted.

The optical filter described above is excellent in transparency and also excellent in adhesion to the film base because the antistatic coating protecting the film base is formed and the antistatic coating is formed from the above antistatic coating materials. Moreover this optical filter is a filter excellent in stability of antistatic property and its surface is hard to be adhered by dust.

Then such an optical filter is suitably used as an antireflecting film an infrared absorption film an electromagnetic wave absorption film and the like for liquid crystal displays and plasma displays.

Moreover the optical filter of the present invention is not limited to the above mentioned embodiment examples if the optical filter has an antistatic coating formed from the above antistatic coating materials.

For example a polarizing plate can also be used in place of the film base. For example a polarizing plate is obtained by laminating protecting films on one side or both sides of a polyvinyl alcohol resin film in which a dichromic colorant is absorbed and oriented. As dichromic colorants iodine dichromic dyes can be used. Such an optical filter can be provided at the uppermost surface of a liquid crystal display.

An embodiment example of an optical information recording medium of the present invention is explained.

The optical information recording medium of this embodiment example is shown in . This optical information recording medium is a rewrite type disk and has a structure in which a disk like transparent resin base a first dielectric layer an optical information recording layer a second dielectric layer a metal reflecting layer and an antistatic coating are formed in order.

As materials constructing the first dielectric layer and the second dielectric layer for example inorganic materials such as SiN SiO SiO TaO or the like can be used. These dielectric layers are formed in a thickness of 10 to 500 nm by well known means such as vacuum vapor deposition process sputtering process ion plating process and the like.

As materials constructing the optical information recording layer for example inorganic photomagnetic recording materials such as Tb Fe Tb Fe Co Dy Fe Co Tb Dy Fe Co and the like inorganic phase change recording materials such as TeOx Te Ge Sn Te Ge Bi Te Ge Sb Te Ge Pb Sn Te Tl In Se and the like and organic colorants such as cyanine colorants polymethine colorants phthalocyanine colorants merocyanine colorants azulene colorants squalium colorants and the like are used.

When the optical information recording layer is made of inorganic photomagnetic recording materials it can be formed in a thickness of 10 to 999 nm by well known means such as vacuum vapor deposition process sputtering process ion plating process and the like. When the optical information recording layer is made of organic colorants a solution given by dissolving an organic colorant in a solvent such as acetone diacetone alcohol ethanol methanol and the like can be formed in a thickness of 10 to 999 nm by well known printing process or coating process.

The metal reflecting layer exhibits light reflectivity and is composed of metals such as Al Cr Ni Ag Au and the like and oxides thereof nitrides thereof and the like separately or by combining two or more kinds of them. This metal reflecting layer is formed in a thickness 2 to 200 nm by sputtering or vacuum deposition process.

The antistatic coating is formed from the above antistatic coating materials. Since the surface hardness of the antistatic coating is set to HB or harder the antistatic coating can prevent surface scratch of the optical information recording medium and prevent oxidation of the metal reflecting layer as well as the adherence of dust due to static electricity.

The thickness of antistatic coating is preferably 3 to 15 m. If the thickness is thinner than 3 m the formation of a uniform membrane tends to become difficult sufficient antistatic property surface scratch resistance and oxidation resistance of the metal reflecting layer sometimes cannot be displayed. On the other hand if the thickness is thicker than 15 m it is feared that the internal stress increases and mechanical properties of the optical information recording medium deteriorate.

The antistatic coating is formed by applying an antistatic coating material on the metal reflecting layer by well known methods such as comma coating spray coating roll coating gravure printing and the like and then drying the solvent or curing by heat or UV irradiation.

In the optical information recording medium explained above the antistatic coating protecting the optical information recording layer and the metal reflecting layer is formed and the antistatic coating is formed from the above antistatic coating material. Accordingly the antistatic coating is excellent in transparency in the range of 780 nm and 635 nm which is a range of wavelength of read only laser because the haze is low and the light transmittance is high. Moreover the dust adherence due to static electricity is suppressed and the recording reading errors and writing errors are prevented because the antistatic coating has the antistatic property.

Moreover the optical information recording medium of the present invention is not limited to the above mentioned embodiment example the optical information recording medium may also be a postscript type disk. For example the postscript type disk has a structure in which a transparent resin base organic base an optical information recording layer a reflecting metal layer and an antistatic coating are formed in order.

An embodiment example of a capacitor of the present invention and its production method is explained.

Examples of valve metals forming the anode include aluminum tantalum niobium titanium hafnium zirconium zinc tungsten bismuth antimony and the like. Among these aluminum tantalum and niobium are preferably used. These valve metals can form a densely and durable dielectric oxide film dielectric layer by electrolytic oxidation therefore the capacity of capacitor can be stably increased.

As specific examples of anode an anode obtained by etching an aluminum foil to increase the surface area and then oxidizing its surface an anode obtained by oxidizing the surface of sintered body of tantalum particles or niobium particles and then forming pellets and the like are given. The irregularities are formed on the surface of anodes thus treated.

The dielectric layer is formed for example by anodic oxidation of the surface of metal body in an electrolyte such as an aqueous solution of ammonium adipate. Accordingly as shown in the irregularities are similarly formed at the surface of the dielectric layer as the anode .

A cathode comprises a solid electrolyte layer and a conductive layer composed of carbon silver aluminum and the like and formed on the solid electrolyte layer . The solid electrolyte layer comprises a conjugated conductive polymer a polyanion and a hydroxy group containing aromatic compound.

When the conductive layer is constructed of carbon silver and the like it is formed from a conductive paste containing a conductor such as carbon silver and the like. When the conductive layer is constructed of aluminum it is formed from an aluminum foil.

Moreover a separator can be provided between the solid electrolyte layer and the conductive layer as necessary.

A production method of the capacitor is a method wherein a conductive polymer solution is applied to the surface of a dielectric layer of a capacitor intermediate having the anode composed of a porous valve metal body and the dielectric layer of an oxide film formed by oxidizing the surface of the anode to form the solid electrolyte layer

The conductive polymer solution in this production method contains a r conjugated conductive polymer a polyanion a hydroxy group containing aromatic compound and a solvent.

To prepare the conductive polymer solution first the polyanion is dissolved in a solvent which can dissolve the polyanion a precursor monomer such as aniline pyrrole thiophene and the like forming the conjugated conductive polymer is added into the obtained solution. Next an oxidant is added to polymerize the precursor monomer subsequently excess oxidant and precursor monomer are separated and purified. Then the hydroxy group containing aromatic compound is added to obtain the conductive polymer solution.

Solvents contained in the conductive polymer solution are not specially limited examples of solvents include alcohol solvents such as methanol ethanol isopropyl alcohol IPA and the like amide solvents such as N methylpyrrolidone NMP dimethylacetamide DMAc dimethylformamide DMF and the like ketone solvents such as methyl ethyl ketone MEK acetone cyclohexane and the like ester solvents such as ethyl acetate butyl acetate and the like toluene xylene water and the like. They may be used separately or used by mixing. Water and alcohol solvents with a low environmental load are preferable among them from a recent viewpoint of environmental protection.

Examples of coating methods of the conductive polymer solution include well known methods such as coating dipping spraying and the like. Examples of drying methods include well known methods such as hot air drying and the like.

After the solid electrolyte layer is formed the conductive layer can be formed by well known methods such as a method using a carbon paste or silver paste and a method providing the cathode at the opposed side via a separator.

In the solid electrolyte layer since the particle diameter of the conjugated conductive polymer is large the conjugated conductive polymer does not reach to the deepest part of fine voids at the surface of dielectric layer of the capacitor intermediate product sometimes it becomes difficult to derive a capacity. Therefore it is preferable that the capacity is supplemented by impregnating an electrolyte as necessary after the solid electrolyte layer is formed.

Electrolytes are not specially limited if they have a high conductivity and well known electrolytes are dissolved in well known solvents.

Examples of solvents in the electrolytes include alcohol solvents such as ethylene glycol diethylene glycol propylene glycol 1 4 butanediol glycerin and the like lactone solvents such as butyrolactone valerolactone valerolactone and the like amide solvents such as N methylformamide N N dimethylformamide N methylacetamide N methylpyrrolidinone and the like nitrile solvents such as acetonitrile 3 methoxypropionitrile and the like water and the like.

Examples of the electrolytes include electrolytes with organic acids such as adipic acid glutaric acid succinic acid benzoic acid isophthalic acid phthalic acid terephthalic acid maleic acid toluic acid enanthic acid malonic acid formic acid decane dicarboxylic acids such as 1 6 decane dicarboxylic acid 5 6 decane dicarboxylic acid and the like octane dicarboxylic acids such as 1 7 octane dicarboxylic acid and the like azelaic acid sebacic acid and the like or inorganic acids such as boric acid polyalcohol complexes of boric acid obtained from boric acid and polyalcohols phosphoric acid carbonic acid silicic acid and the like as anion component and primary amines methylamine ethylamine propylamine butylamine ethylenediamine and the like secondary amines dimethylamine diethylamine dipropylamine methylethylamine diphenylamine and the like tertiary amines trimethylamine triethylamine tripropylamine triphenylamine 1 8 diazabicyclo 5 4 0 undecene 7 and the like tetraalkylammoniums tetramethylammonium tetraethylammonium tetrapropylammonium tetrabutylammonium methyltriethylammonium dimethyldiethylammonium and the like and the like as cation component.

The above mentioned production method involves simple processes is suited to mass production and is low cost because the solid electrolyte layer is formed by coating a conductive polymer solution and then drying. Furthermore since the conductive polymer solution contains a conjugated conductive polymer a polyanion and a hydroxy group containing aromatic compound the degradation of the conjugated conductive polymer in the solid electrolyte layer is suppressed and the hopping energy is reduced. Therefore the conductivity of the solid electrolyte layer can be increased and thus the performance of the capacitor can be improved.
