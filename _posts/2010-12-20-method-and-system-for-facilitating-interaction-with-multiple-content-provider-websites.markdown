The present application claims the benefit of and hereby incorporates by reference the other patent application having the same title as the present application and filed on even date herewith.

The present invention relates to communications involving electronic devices and more particularly to communications between such devices and content provider websites.

Content provider websites CPWs are interactive websites that allow for the downloading and or uploading e.g. posting of various forms of information data which can generally be considered content . CPWs encompass a variety of types of websites including for example social networking websites SNWs news feeds music and photograph websites as well as other types of websites such as business to business b2b or business to consumer b2c websites. The forms of content that can be downloaded from and or uploaded to CPWs are wide ranging and can include for example news weather personal and or business information pictures videos songs etc.

The communication of content by way of CPWs can serve a variety of purposes. Among other things the uploading of content to a CPW by one user can allow other users to access and or download the uploaded content. Indeed many CPWs typically this is true of SNWs in particular provide an architecture for countless users to create respective personal or professional spaces that respectively identify the respective users and allow uploaded content to be associated with the respective spaces that can in turn be accessed by other users. By virtue of such operation CPWs can facilitate the creation and maintaining of interpersonal connections among persons and groups.

CPWs can be in communication with users who are operating any of a variety of different types of electronic devices which are in contact with the CPWs often by way of internet type networks. Increasingly users employ mobile devices to interact with the CPWs. As communications activities with CPWs increase and particularly in some circumstances where a given mobile device is in communication with multiple CPWs the communications can become tedious and difficult to manage. For example when a user wishes for content from the user s mobile device to be uploaded to multiple CPWs the user may need to command the mobile device to perform and the mobile device may need to perform in a redundant manner the same or similar uploading tasks in relation to each of the different CPWs.

Also for example when a user wishes to modify content already uploaded to multiple CPWs the tasks involved in effecting the desired modification at the different CPWs can be difficult to execute given the different characteristics or requirements of the different CPWs. Among other things performing actions on the uploaded content can be complicated by the fact that one CPW may or may not support the same action as another CPW such that a user attempting to cause such actions will need to remember which CPW supports the action in question.

Further for example when the user s mobile device and thus the user is in communication with multiple CPWs it can become difficult for the user to keep track of different communications occurring in relation to the various CPWs e.g. as may occur when other users contribute messages to the various CPWs. It can be particularly confusing for a user to keep track of different communications when the communications involving the various CPWs all relate to the same topic.

It would therefore be advantageous if improved systems and or improved methods for facilitating interactions between mobile or other electronic devices and CPWs could be developed that would help to address at least partly one or more of the aforementioned developing needs.

In at least one embodiment the present invention relates to a method of facilitating interaction between an electronic device and a plurality of content provider websites. The method includes receiving at a server a plurality of information portions respectively provided from the plurality of content provider websites respectively where each of the plurality of information portions is associated with a respective copy of primary information that is available at each of the content provider websites. The method additionally includes aggregating at the server the respective information portions so that the plurality of information portions are combined into an overall grouping where the respective information portions are maintained respectively as distinct subportions within the overall grouping. Further the method also includes sending from the server a primary message for receipt by at least one part of the electronic device the primary message including the overall grouping of the information portions where the overall grouping is sent together with an additional copy of the primary information or with an indication of the primary information to which the overall grouping relates whereby the electronic device upon the primary message being received by the at least one part thereof is able to display an image showing both at least a portion of the primary information in conjunction with the overall grouping including the distinct subportions.

In at least one further embodiment the present invention relates to a system for facilitating interaction between an electronic device and a plurality of content provider websites. The system includes a first server having a processing device and at least one memory device where the server operates as an intermediary between at least one part of the electronic device and the plurality of content provider websites. The first server particularly is configured to operate so that upon receiving a plurality of information portions respectively provided from the plurality of content provider websites respectively and upon determining that the plurality of information portions all relate to primary information that is available at each of the content provider websites the first server aggregates the information portions so as to be combined into an overall grouping in which the respective information portions are maintained respectively as distinct subportions.

Referring to a block diagram of an example communications system is shown in a simplified schematic form. As shown the communications system includes in this embodiment three mobile devices a first one of which is shown to be in communication via a communication link with a server which in the present embodiment is a web server e.g. a server that supports internet protocols or otherwise is capable of interaction with the internet or World Wide Web . The mobile devices are respectively representative of communication devices operated by persons or users or possibly by other entities e.g. other computers desiring or requiring communication capabilities. In some embodiments for example the mobile devices can be any of cellular telephones personal digital assistants PDAs smart phones other handheld or portable electronic devices headsets MP3 players battery powered devices wearable devices radios navigation devices laptop or notebook computers netbooks pagers PMPs personal media players DVRs digital video recorders gaming devices cameras netbooks e readers e books tablet devices navigation devices with video capable screens multimedia docking stations or other mobile devices.

The communications system additionally is shown to include three content provider websites CPWs each of which is shown to be in communication with the intermediary web server via a respective communication link . Further a communication link is also provided that allows for the first one of the mobile devices that is shown to be in communication with the web server to directly communicate with a first one of the CPWs that is also in communication with the web server without the intermediation of the web server . Although only the first one of the mobile devices is shown to be in communication with the web server it will be understood that depending upon the time or operational circumstance any or all of the mobile devices can be in communication with the web server. Further depending upon the time or operational circumstance any of the mobile devices can also or alternatively enter into communication with any of the CPWs by way of direct communication links such as the link .

The CPWs are generally intended to encompass a variety of interactive websites including for example social networking websites SNWs that allow for the downloading uploading e.g. posting and or other accessing of various forms of data such as personal and or business information news information weather information pictures videos and songs and thereby facilitate the creation and maintaining of interpersonal connections among persons and groups of persons. Examples of such CPWs include for example Facebook MySpace hi5 LinkedIn and Twitter . For purposes of the present invention CPWs can also be understood to encompass various other types of websites e.g. business to business websites business to consumer websites and or other websites that while not focused entirely or predominantly upon social networking nevertheless also include social networking type features . For example other CPWs can include sources of RSS Really Simple Syndication or other news feeds photograph services such as Picasa or Photobucket and music services such as LastFM . Generally speaking the CPWs can encompass any websites to which data can be uploaded and or from which data can be downloaded to mobile devices such as the mobile devices .

Although three mobile devices are shown in in other embodiments only one mobile device is present in communication with the web server or alternatively any arbitrary number of mobile devices can be in communication with the web server . Likewise although three CPWs are shown to be in communication with the web server in in other embodiments only one CPW is in communication with the web server or alternatively any arbitrary number of CPWs can be in communication with the web server . Additionally any arbitrary number of mobile device s can be in communication with any arbitrary number of CPW s by way of direct communication links such as the link in other embodiments. That is is intended to be representative of any of a variety of systems employing any arbitrary number of mobile devices and any arbitrary number of CPWs that are in communication with one another either indirectly via a web server interface or directly with one another. That said as discussed further below at least some embodiments of the present invention particularly are directed toward facilitating communications interactions between a given mobile device e.g. the first one of the mobile device and multiple e.g. at least two CPWs.

Depending upon the embodiment the communication links can be part of a single network or multiple networks and each link can include one or more wired and or wireless communication pathways for example landline e.g. fiber optic copper wiring microwave communication radio channel wireless path intranet internet and or World Wide Web communication pathways which themselves can employ numerous intermediary hardware and or software devices including for example numerous routers etc. . In addition a variety of communication protocols and methodologies can be used to conduct the communications via the communication links between the mobile devices web server and CPWs including for example transmission control protocol internet protocol TCP IP extensible messaging and presence protocol XMPP file transfer protocol FTP etc. In other embodiments other types of communication links for facilitating the transfer of signals between the plurality of mobile devices and the CPWs can be utilized as well. Although in the present embodiment the communication links network and server are each discussed as being web based in other embodiments the links network and server can assume various non web based forms.

As will be discussed in more detail below the web server is configured to serve as an intermediary between the mobile devices and the CPWs . Various types of communications between the mobile devices and CPWs are passed through processed and or monitored by the web server including for example communications involving the uploading and downloading of files e.g. photos music videos text entries etc. blog postings and messaging e.g. Short Message Service SMS Multimedia Messaging Service MMS and Instant Messaging IM . More particularly in some embodiments the web server operates in one or more manners that facilitate communications interactions between the mobile devices and CPWs involving the uploading of information to multiple ones of the CPWs from a given one e.g. the first one of the mobile devices the downloading of information from multiple ones of the CPWs to a given e.g. the first one of the mobile devices the editing of information at multiple ones of the CPWs and or the deletion of information from multiple ones of the CPWs. Further in some embodiments the web server also or instead operates in one or more manners that facilitate aggregation and or organization of information found at multiple ones of the CPWs and or facilitates the presentation or other usage of such information at a given one e.g. the first one of the mobile devices .

Referring to there is provided a block diagram illustrating example internal components of the first one of the mobile devices of in accordance with the present embodiment. It should be understood that it is possibly the case albeit not necessarily the case that these internal components are also present in one or more of the other ones of the mobile devices of and not just the first one . As shown in the components include one or more wireless transceivers a processor e.g. a microprocessor microcomputer application specific integrated circuit etc. a memory portion one or more output devices and one or more input devices . In at least some embodiments a user interface is present that comprises one or more of the output devices such as a display and one or more of the input device such as a keypad or touch sensor.

The internal components can further include a component interface to provide a direct connection to auxiliary components or accessories for additional or enhanced functionality. The internal components preferably also include a power supply such as a battery for providing power to the other internal components while enabling the mobile device to be portable. Further the internal components additionally include one or more sensors . All of the internal components can be coupled to one another and in communication with one another by way of one or more internal communication links e.g. an internal bus .

Each of the wireless transceivers utilizes a wireless technology for communication which can include for example but are not limited to cellular based communication technologies such as analog communications using AMPS digital communications using CDMA TDMA GSM iDEN GPRS EDGE etc. and next generation communications using UMTS WCDMA LTE IEEE 802.16 etc. or variants thereof or peer to peer or ad hoc communication technologies such as HomeRF radio frequency Bluetooth and IEEE 802.11 a b g or n or other wireless communication technologies such as infrared technology. In the present embodiment the wireless transceivers include a cellular transceiver and a wireless local area network WLAN transceiver although in other embodiments only one of these types of wireless transceivers and possibly neither of these types of wireless transceivers and or other types of wireless transceivers is present.

By virtue of the use of the wireless transceivers the first one of the mobile devices is capable of communicating with the web server e.g. by way of the communication link and thus indirectly with each of the CPWs . Further by virtue of the use of the wireless transceivers the first one of the mobile devices also is capable of communicating directly with the CPWs such as the first one of the CPWs by way of direct communication link s such as the communication link .

Example operation of the wireless transceivers in conjunction with others of the internal components of the first one of the mobile devices can take a variety of forms and can include for example operation in which upon reception of wireless signals the internal components detect communication signals and the transceiver demodulates the communication signals to recover incoming information such as voice and or data transmitted by the wireless signals. After receiving the incoming information from the transceiver the processor formats the incoming information for the one or more output devices . Likewise for transmission of wireless signals the processor formats outgoing information which can but need not be activated by the input devices and conveys the outgoing information to one or more of the wireless transceivers for modulation so as to provide modulated communication signals to be transmitted. The wireless transceiver s convey the modulated communication signals by way of wireless as well as possibly wired communication links such as the communication links to other devices such as the web server and one or more of the CPWs as well as possibly to other devices such as a cell tower access point or another server or any of a variety of remote devices .

Depending upon the embodiment the input and output devices of the internal components can include a variety of visual audio and or mechanical outputs. For example the output device s can include one or more visual output devices such as a liquid crystal display and light emitting diode indicator one or more audio output devices such as a speaker alarm and or buzzer and or one or more mechanical output devices such as a vibrating mechanism. The visual output devices among other things can also include a video screen. Likewise by example the input device s can include one or more visual input devices such as an optical sensor for example a camera lens and photosensor one or more audio input devices such as a microphone and one or more mechanical input devices such as a flip sensor keyboard keypad selection button navigation cluster touch pad capacitive sensor motion sensor and switch. Operations that can actuate one or more of the input devices can include not only the physical pressing actuation of buttons or other actuators but can also include for example opening the mobile device unlocking the device moving the device to actuate a motion moving the device to actuate a location positioning system and operating the device.

As mentioned above the internal components also can include one or more of various types of sensors . The sensors can include for example proximity sensors e.g. a light detecting sensor an ultrasound transceiver or an infrared transceiver touch sensors altitude sensors and one or more location circuits components that can include for example a Global Positioning System GPS receiver a triangulation receiver an accelerometer a tilt sensor a gyroscope or any other information collecting device that can identify a current location or user device interface carry mode of the mobile device . While the sensors are for the purposes of considered to be distinct from the input devices in other embodiments it is possible that one or more of the input devices can also be considered to constitute one or more of the sensors and vice versa . Additionally while in the present embodiment the input devices are shown to be distinct from the output devices it should be recognized that in some embodiments one or more devices serve both as input device s and output device s . For example in embodiments where a touchscreen is employed the touchscreen can be considered to constitute both a visual output device and a mechanical input device.

The memory portion of the internal components can encompass one or more memory devices of any of a variety of forms e.g. read only memory random access memory static random access memory dynamic random access memory etc. and can be used by the processor to store and retrieve data. In some embodiments the memory portion can be integrated with the processor in a single device e.g. a processing device including memory or processor in memory PIM albeit such a single device will still typically have distinct portions sections that perform the different processing and memory functions and that can be considered separate devices. The data that is stored by the memory portion can include but need not be limited to operating systems applications and informational data. Each operating system includes executable code that controls basic functions of the mobile device such as interaction among the various components included among the internal components communication with external devices via the wireless transceivers and or the component interface and storage and retrieval of applications and data to and from the memory portion . Each application includes executable code that utilizes an operating system to provide more specific functionality such as file system service and handling of protected and unprotected data stored in the memory portion .

As for informational data this is non executable code or information that can be referenced and or manipulated by an operating system or application for performing functions of the mobile device. Additionally among other things informational data can include any of a variety of types of information that is uploaded to downloaded from or otherwise accessed at the web server or one or more of the CPWs with respect to which the first one of the mobile devices is in communication. As mentioned above such information can include for example personal and or business information news information weather information pictures videos and songs etc.

Referring next to example components of the web server of are shown in more detail. As shown the web server includes a memory portion a processor portion in communication with that memory portion and first and second input output I O interfaces and respectively for interfacing the communication links and respectively with the processor portion . In at least some embodiments including the present embodiment the web server can also be understood to serve as an aggregation server since as discussed further below the web server keeps track of and aggregates a variety of information that is from or that is intended to be provided to or otherwise relates to multiple ones of the CPWs as well as possibly a variety of information that is from or that is intended to be provided to or otherwise relates to multiple ones of the mobile devices .

As shown in the processor portion further includes a front end portion and a back end portion . The back end portion communicates with the CPWs such as the first one of the CPWs shown in dashed lines via the communication links one of which is shown and the second I O interface . In some embodiments particularly where the CPWs are SNWs the back end portion can be referred to as a Social Network Processor . Additionally the front end portion communicates with the first one of the mobile devices also shown in dashed lines via the communication link and the first I O interface . In view of the above discussion it should further be understood that the front end portion can also be in communication with the others of the mobile devices other than the first one via additional communication links not shown .

In at least some embodiments the back end portion supports pull communications with CPWs such as the CPW . The pull communications can for example be implemented using Representation State Transfer REST architecture of the type typical to the web. Assuming this to be the case the back end portion is configured to generate requests for information to be provided to the back end portion from the CPWs such as the first one of the CPWs at times circumstances determined by the web server in response to which the CPWs search for and provide back to the web server requested data. Also in at least some embodiments the front end portion establishes a push channel in conjunction with the first one of the mobile devices . It should be understood that additional push channels can be established with respect to the others of the mobile devices as well.

In at least some such embodiments the push channel allows the front end portion to provide notifications generated by the front end portion from the web server to the first one of the mobile devices at times circumstances determined by the web server the notifications being indicative of information content that is available to be provided to that mobile device. The first one of the mobile devices in turn is able to respond to the notifications in manner s deemed appropriate by the mobile device. Such responses often but not necessarily always constitute requests that some or all of the available information content be provided from the front end portion of the web server to the first one of the mobile devices .

The server discussed with reference can take forms depending upon the implementation or embodiment. In at least some circumstances the server discussed with reference to can be considered a cloud. Further although show the single server it should be understood that in other embodiments there can be more than one intermediating device constituting a cloud or implemented in place of the server including for example a collection of multiple servers that are in communication with one another and that in at least some embodiments support Internet technologies for communication between entities. Also in at least some embodiments the server or corresponding cloud or other intermediating device s can employ web 2.0 functionality and beyond including for example further evolution of such functionality and or new push functionality. Additionally in some embodiments the server or corresponding cloud or other intermediating device s is capable of supporting and creating services and applications for registration storing and relaying client capabilities and or preferences among other things.

Turning now to a series of schematic block diagrams see and flowcharts see are provided to illustrate exemplary operation of the system of particularly example operation in which one of the mobile devices such as the first one of the mobile devices interacts with multiple ones of the CPWs by way of the web server to achieve various goals. Given that the processes represented in particularly involve the web server interacting with the first one of the mobile devices as well as with the CPWs for convenience of illustration the steps performed by each of these different devices are shown to be separated into three columns one for the mobile device one for the web server and one for the CPWs in each of these FIGS. Also for convenience of illustration it should be understood that the steps shown in as being performed by a CPW are actually performed by each respective one of the CPWs that are in communication with the web server and further that the steps shown in as being performed by the web server in relation to a CPW are actually performed by the web server either on a repeated basis with respect to the multiple CPWs or are intended to be representative of steps performed by the web server on a collective basis relative to the multiple CPWs.

More particularly shows a schematic block diagram illustrating example operation of the system in which information in this example a photo is uploaded from the first one of the mobile devices to multiple ones of the CPWs by way of the web server . Correspondingly shows a flowchart illustrating example steps of operation that are performed by the first one of the mobile devices the web or aggregation server and each respective one of the CPWs that is involved. By comparison shows a schematic block diagram illustrating example operation of the system in which information again in this example a photo is deleted from multiple ones of the CPWs as well as from the first one of the mobile devices in accordance with instructions from the first one of the mobile devices by way of the web server while correspondingly shows a flow chart showing example steps of the mobile device web server and each CPW in this respect.

Further with respect to there is shown a schematic block diagram illustrating example operation of the system in which information stored at multiple ones of the CPWs can be edited based upon instructions received at and provided from the first one of the mobile devices to the web server while correspondingly shows a flowchart illustrating example steps of the mobile device web server and each CPW in this regard. As for there is shown a flow chart illustrating example operation of the system in which information received at multiple ones of the CPWs that all relates to a given portion of information such as a photo that has been uploaded from the first one of the mobile device is then aggregated and ultimately provided to and displayed by that mobile device. correspondingly shows a flowchart portraying example steps of the system as it operates in this manner.

Referring now to in some embodiments of the present invention the system is configured to facilitate the uploading of information from a given one of the mobile devices such as the first one to multiple ones of the CPWs by way of the web server . Particularly with respect to the process shown in upon starting operation at a start step the first one of the mobile devices receives or otherwise obtains and stores in this example as shown in a photo at a step . The photo which is intended to be representative of any of a variety of types of information that can be uploaded depending upon the embodiment or circumstance can be received from a variety of sources. For example the photo may have been taken by way of the mobile device itself by way of a camera included as part of the mobile device. By receiving an appropriate input from the user of the mobile device the mobile device video screen can display an image as shown in in which the photo or other information of interest is fully or partly displayed on the screen along with a selectable option button . Given such a display the user of the mobile device is thus able to provide an input by selecting the button indicative of the user s command that the photo be uploaded to one or more of the CPWs . Thus at a step as shown in the mobile device receives such a command.

At this point in order to facilitate the user s further specifying of which of the CPWs should receive the photo or other information about to be uploaded it is desirable that the mobile device be able to display for the user a listing of all of the ones of the CPWs with which the mobile device and or user currently are in contact. In some embodiments it is possible that this information will be regularly stored on the mobile device itself while in other embodiments this information is obtained instead by contacting the web server . Thus as illustrated in in the present embodiment upon the completion of the step the listing of supported CPWs is immediately displayed at a step . And thus as illustrated in such a list of the supported CPWs is displayed in an image on the video screen of the mobile device . As represented by an arrow the video screen of the mobile device thus switches from displaying the image to the image .

Alternatively as illustrated by the dashed arrows in if the supported CPW information is not already available to the mobile device at the step then the process instead advances to a step at which the mobile device sends a query to the web aggregation server to identify the supported CPWs . Upon receiving that query the web server at a step in turn determines the supported CPWs and then sends the list of those CPWs back to the mobile device . Next at a step the mobile device then receives that list of supported CPWs back from the web server and thus the process is again able to proceed to the step at which the list of supported CPWs is displayed on the video screen of the mobile device as is shown in .

Once the list of supported CPWs is displayed on the video screen of the mobile device then the mobile device is able to receive from the user an indication of the one or more of those CPWs to which the user wishes the photo or other information to be uploaded at a step as shown in . In the embodiment of such an indication is received by providing on the video screen boxes that can be checked by the user more particularly in the example shown in each of the three CPWs that can be selected from a list are shown to have been selected by the user. Then upon the user checking the boxes corresponding to one or more of the CPWs upon the user further selecting a continue button also displayed on the video screen of the mobile device again see at a step the mobile device sends the photo or other information as well as the selected CPW information that is the identities of one or more of the CPWs that were selected by the user to the web server . The uploading of the information occurring at the step is indicated by an arrow shown in pointing to the web server .

As further shown in upon the web server receiving the photo or other information at a step at a subsequent step the web server assigns an initial identification code or initial ID to the photo or other information that has been received. Upon assigning the initial ID then at a step the photo or other information in combination with the initial ID is sent to the selected ones of the CPWs . The sending operation at the step is represented by additional arrows shown in .

Subsequently at a step of the respective selected ones of the CPWs receive the photo or other information plus the initial ID information sent at the step . The receipt of the photo or other information plus the initial ID at the step is reflected in which shows three of the CPWs including the first one of the CPWs as having received the photo . Typically this information is then stored at the respective selected ones of the CPWs . It should be noted that although shows certain steps as being performed by a given one of the CPWs e.g. the first one the same steps are envisioned as being performed at each of the CPWs that have been selected at the step and to which the photo or other information plus initial ID information is sent at the step . That being the case at a next step at each of the selected ones of the CPWs an additional ID is determined or generated. Further at a step each respective one of the selected CPWs sends as a response to the web server the respective additional ID generated at the step by that respective one of the CPWs plus the initial ID that was provided from the web server at the step back to the web server.

Upon the sending of the additional ID plus the initial ID information back to the web server at the step then at a step the web server receives that information back from the respective selected ones of the CPWs . Further at a step the web server determines whether all photo or other information that was sent at the step has been properly received by the selected ones of the CPWs . This can be determined based upon the ID information more particularly the additional ID and initial ID information received back from the CPWs at the step . In the present embodiment the mere receipt of additional ID information from the respective selected ones of the CPWs can itself be indicative of the successful receipt by those CPWs respectively and or collectively of the information sent at the step . However in other embodiments the additional ID information is coded so as to properly indicate in a manner recognized by the web server that the information uploaded at the step has been properly received absent proper coding being included in the additional ID information provided from a given CPW the web server will assume that the information sent to that CPW at the step was not properly received. In some cases further the additional ID information is particularly coded in a manner understood by the web server as indicating the identity of the one of the CPWs from which that additional ID information was provided.

If at the step it is determined that one or more of the intended that is selected ones of the CPWs did not successfully receive the uploaded information the web server determines whether a repeat upload was already attempted at an earlier time at a step . If no repeat upload was already attempted then the web server returns to the step at which it attempts again to send the photo or other information plus the initial ID information to the selected CPWs. It should be understood that although a first attempt at sending the photo or other information and initial ID information at the step will typically involve sending of that information to each of the ones of the CPWs that were originally selected at the step when an upload is repeated as a consequence of the steps and then the photo or other information and initial ID information sent at the step will often only be sent to that one or more of the CPWs at which the first upload was unsuccessful. Further if at the step it is determined that a repeat upload was already attempted once before then instead of proceeding back to the step the web server advances from the step instead to a step at which it sends an error message to the mobile device indicating that one or more of the CPWs that were earlier selected were unable to receive the intended photo or other information .

Alternatively if at the step it is determined that all of the photo or other information and initial ID information transmitted at the step was properly received by all of the selected ones of the CPWs as indicated by the ID information then the web server proceeds from the step to a step at which the web server sends to the mobile device a confirmation that proper uploading to the CPWs took place. Upon the sending of the error or confirmation messages at the steps or then at a step the first one of the mobile devices receives those message s as applicable and displays whether the information was properly uploaded or not for viewing by the user after which at a step the process is ended.

Turning to additional operations of the system are shown by which a photo or other information such as the photo uploaded as a result of the operations discussed above with respect to is deleted from the first one of the mobile devices and also deleted from certain ones of the CPWs from which it had earlier been uploaded. The deletion process begins at a step of the flowchart of which is the start step subsequent to which at a step the first one of the mobile devices receives a command to delete the photo or other information . As illustrated in the command to delete the photo or other information can be provided by a user to the first one of the mobile devices by selecting a delete button displayed on an image provided on a video screen of the mobile device that also shows the photo or other information potentially about to be deleted.

Upon receiving the command to delete the photo or other information at the step at a step the first one of the mobile devices then determines where the photo or other information is stored. Typically upon the uploading of the photo or other information as discussed with reference to that photo or other information will be stored on the mobile device that performed the uploading as well as one or more of the CPWs to which it was uploaded. In some cases the photo or other information can also be stored on the web server although it is not necessary. Regardless of the location s at which the photo or other information is stored in the present embodiment it is envisioned that the first one of the mobile devices has or at least is able to readily access a record of where the photo or other information has been stored. The record of where the information has been stored in terms of the CPWs and or other locations at which it has been stored can for example have been previously provided from the web server back to the first one of the mobile devices upon the uploading being completed e.g. at the receiving of the confirmation or error messages in accordance with the step of as discussed above. In alternate embodiments in order to obtain the record of the locations at which the photo or other information has been stored the first one of the mobile devices will need to contact the web server .

Upon determining where the photo or other information is stored at the step then at a next step the first one of the mobile devices displays a list of the location s at which the photo or other information is stored on the video screen of the mobile device. The listing can be displayed in a variety of manners. For example in the present embodiment as shown in an additional video screen image is displayed on the first one of the mobile devices that lists all of the locations at which the photo or other information has been stored namely in this case the first one of the mobile devices itself as well as three of the CPWs . As indicated by an arrow the video screen is switched from displaying the image to displaying the image .

In addition to the displaying of the list of locations at which the photo or other information is stored at a step of the process represented by the flowchart the first one of the mobile devices additionally receives an indication of one or more of those location s from which the photo or other information should be deleted. The indication can be provided to the first one of the mobile devices by a user in a variety of manners depending upon the embodiment. In the embodiment of for example the additional video screen image includes not only a listing of the locations at which the photo or other information is stored but also selectable boxes adjacent to each of the locations at which the photo or other information is stored plus a continue button . The user thus is provided with an opportunity to specify by checking one or more of the selectable boxes those of the locations at which the photo or other information is stored from which the user wishes the photo or other information to be deleted and then to further indicate approval of the selections by pressing the continue button .

Upon completion of the step the process of then advances to a step at which the first one of the mobile devices determines whether the indication provided at the step includes an instruction to delete the photo or other information from the first one of the mobile devices itself. If at the step it is determined that there was an instruction to delete the photo or other information from the first one of the mobile devices itself then the process advances to a step at which the photo or other information is deleted from that mobile device. If instead at the step it is determined that there was no instruction to delete the photo or other information from the first one of the mobile devices itself then the process advances to a step as does the process upon the completion of the step as well. At the step the first one of the mobile devices further determines whether the indication received at the step included an additional instruction or instructions to delete the photo or other information from one or more of the CPWs . If no such additional deletion instruction s were received then the process advances to a step at which the first one of the mobile devices indicates what deletion if any has taken place and after which the process ends at a step . Alternatively if there were such additional deletion instruction s then at a further step those deletion instruction s are sent from the first one of the mobile devices to the web server as further illustrated by an arrow shown on .

Upon the sending of the deletion instruction s to the web server then at a step the web server receives that deletion instruction indication. Then at a step the web server determines an initial ID corresponding to the photo or other information to be deleted. Such an initial ID can be the initial ID set earlier when the photo or other information was first uploaded for example at the step of . Additionally at a step the web server further determines the additional ID or IDs corresponding to those of the CPW s from which the photo or other information is to be deleted. Such additional ID information can be all or a portion of the additional ID information that was received by the web server at the step of .

It should be understood that the initial ID information determined at the step can typically be determined by the web server based upon the instructions provided from the mobile device at the step . That is when sending the instruction to the web server at the step the first one of the mobile devices typically includes the initial ID information along with the instructions identifying the particular ones of the CPWs from which the photo or other information is to be deleted. In some cases the information provided from the first one of the mobile devices further includes the additional ID information determined at the step . Alternatively in other embodiments the instructions from the first one of the mobile devices sent at the step merely identify those of the CPWs from which the photo or other information is to be deleted in some other manner and it is then the web server that determines the additional ID information at the step based upon those instructions for example by consulting data stored in the memory portion of the web server .

Upon determining the ID information at the steps and the web server is then ready to send deletion instructions to appropriate ones of the CPWs corresponding to the instructions received from the first one of the mobile devices and does so at a step . In sending the deletion instructions at the step the web server also typically sends the ID information both initial and additional ID information corresponding to the appropriate ones of the CPWs from which the photo or other information is to be deleted since that ID information can then be used by the CPWs themselves to verify the appropriateness of executing the deletion instructions. The sending of the deletion instructions at the step is represented figuratively in by arrows .

Upon the sending of the deletion instructions at the step then at a subsequent step each of the appropriate ones of the CPWs to which the instructions were sent in turn receives such instructions and associated ID information. Next at a step each respective one of the CPWs that received the instruction s and ID information determines whether the received ID information is correct in terms of corroborating that the respective CPW should in fact perform the instructed deletion. Among other things in this regard the respective CPW can verify that the additional ID information corresponds to the additional ID information previously generated by that CPW in relation to the photo or other information of interest at the step of as well as verify that the additional ID information corresponds to the initial ID information received.

If at the step it is determined by a respective one of the CPWs that the ID information does not corroborate that the deletion instruction should be performed then the process advances from the step to a step at which an error message is sent by that respective one of the CPWs back to the web server . If such an error message is sent and consequently received by the web server at a step then the web server in turn at a step determines whether such an error message has already been received once before from that respective CPW and whether as a consequence the deletion instruction was already resent to that respective CPW. If the deletion instruction was not already resent at an earlier time then the process advances further to a step at which the web server attempts to verify whether the ID information sent with the deletion instructions at the step earlier was in fact correct and if not corrects that ID information. Then in such circumstance the process repeats the step such that the deletion instructions previously sent are resent to the respective CPW from which the error message was received at the step and consequently the steps are also repeated. Alternatively if at the step it is determined by the web server that the deletion instruction was already resent once then the web server presumes that the error in accomplishing the deletion cannot be rectified and thus sends an error message to the first one of the mobile devices from which the original deletion instruction was received at a step . In response at a step the first one of the mobile devices receives that error message and at a step then displays the error message on the video screen of the mobile device after which the process is ended at a step .

Returning back to the step if alternatively it is determined by a respective one of the CPWs among those which received deletion instructions at the step that the received ID information is correct then that CPW instead proceeds to a step at which that respective CPW deletes the photo or other information from its memory in accordance with the received deletion instructions. Upon the deletion being performed then that respective one of the CPWs further sends a confirmation of the deletion back to the web server at a step . That confirmation in turn is received by the web server at a step at which the web server in turn sends the confirmation back to the first one of the mobile devices . The confirmation in turn is received by the first one of the mobile devices at the step in response to which the mobile device displays in this case the confirmation message at the step prior to the process ending at the step .

The displaying of the confirmation error other messages at the step can occur in a variety of manners depending upon the embodiment. illustrates one example in which assuming that all requested deletions have been properly accomplished the video screen of the first one of the mobile devices is controlled to display confirmation information. More particularly illustrates in a figurative manner operation in which the deletion of the photo is performed at each of second and third ones of the CPWs but not the first one of the CPWs at which the photo is to remain as is represented by the Xs through the photo shown to be associated with two out of the three CPWs but not the third. Given that these deletions were properly performed further shows how in response the video screen of the first one of the mobile devices can display two images in succession namely a first image showing an X through the photo that was deleted from the second CPW the third CPW and the first one of the mobile devices itself followed by a second image stating that the deletion has been performed and further reminding the user that notwithstanding these deletions the photo continues to be stored and available on the first one of the CPWs . Once the image is displayed an OK button also shown on that image can be selected by the user to complete the deletion process.

Notwithstanding the images of the confirmation error other message information displayed according to the step of can also take other forms. For example in the case where none of the requested deletions were properly performed the video screen of the first one of the mobile devices can indicate that fact. Also if the deletions were properly performed at certain ones of the CPWs but not others the message displayed by the first one of the mobile devices can indicate that circumstance as well.

Turning next to additional operations of the system are shown that allow for editing of information stored at one or more of the CPWs which in this example is the photo or other information previously uploaded from the first one of the mobile devices as discussed with reference to . Referring particularly to upon the process represented by the flowchart beginning at a start step at a step the first one of the mobile devices receives a command from the user that the photo or other information previously stored and uploaded should be edited. For example as illustrated in the first one of the mobile devices can cause its video screen to display an image on which is shown both particular information that was previously uploaded e.g. the photo shown earlier with respect to including certain associated metadata or other associated information and also a selectable edit button that upon being pressed by the user constitutes the command to edit the stored information in accordance with the step .

Next at a step the first one of the mobile devices additionally displays one or more fields pertaining to selectable specifiable items corresponding to the photo previously uploaded. Typically these selectable specifiable items are metadata items associated with the photo that can be modified or set by the user. Again with respect to for example assuming that there are three metadata items associated with the photo concerning title information caption information and location information corresponding to the photo the first one of the mobile devices can be switched from displaying the image to displaying another image showing fields for title information caption information and location information respectively. The switching from displaying the image to the other image is represented by an arrow shown in . Upon the fields being displayed at the step then at a subsequent step the first one of the mobile devices further receives new modified metadata into those fields. Again for example with respect to the photo shown in the user can specify as shown the terms Mountains for the title the term Pretty landscape for the caption and the term Colorado for the location. The information entered into the fields is particularly received by the first one of the mobile devices after the user presses a continue button shown in the image . Upon receiving the new modified metadata then at a step of the first one of the mobile devices sends that new modified metadata to the web server . The sending of this new modified metadata is also indicated by an arrow of .

Subsequently at a step the new modified metadata is received by the web server . It should be understood that although certain ones of the CPWs can potentially allow for metadata entries or changes with respect to various information such as the photo stored thereon other ones of the CPWs need not allow such updates or changes. Therefore in attempting to achieve editing of the information stored on the CPWs the web server in the present embodiment upon receiving the metadata change request at the step in turn at a subsequent step determines which metadata can in fact be updated modified at each respective one of the CPWs that has stored the photo or other information to which the requested metadata updates changes apply e.g. the photo . In the present embodiment this determination regarding which of the CPWs support certain metadata updates changes is made based upon additional information already available at the web server itself and therefore in the present embodiment the determination made at the step can be made by the web server without consulting or taking any steps to consult other entities such as the CPWs . That said in alternate embodiments it can be appropriate at this time for the web server to contact the appropriate ones of the CPWs to obtain further clarification or information regarding whether those CPWs allow for metadata updates modifications.

Regardless of how the determination at the step is made upon completion of that determination then at a step the web server sends a message back to the first one of the mobile devices indicating any constraints that exist on metadata updating modification as determined at the step . Upon receiving this message at a step the first one of the mobile devices displays this constraint information also at the step shown in . Further for example in this regard illustrates operation in which the web server determines that while the first one of the CPWs is capable of accepting updated modified metadata with respect to each of the title caption and location pertaining to the stored photo information second and third ones of the CPWs do not support editing of the location metadata while the third CPW in particular does not support editing of either the caption or location information. Thus upon receiving this constraint information as illustrated by an arrow from the web server the first one of the mobile devices displays an image representative of these constraints.

Upon the displaying of the constraint information at the step the user is offered an opportunity to determine whether or not the requested metadata updates changes should still be attempted notwithstanding the constraints indicated that is whether or not the requested metadata changes should still be performed where possible even though the changes cannot be performed at all of the CPWs. Authorization to proceed with the metadata changes can be provided at a step by way of a user selecting a button such as an OK button as shown in the image of after reviewing the constraint information. If approval is not granted by the user at the step then the process ends at an end step . Alternatively if notwithstanding the constraint information the user indicates approval e.g. by selecting the OK button a proceed command is then further sent at a step by the first one of the mobile devices back to the web server .

The process then advances to a step at which the web server upon receiving the further instruction to proceed with the metadata changes sends the new modified metadata as appropriate to each respective one of the CPWs in which the photo or other information to which the metadata pertains is stored. In the present embodiment sending of this new modified metadata is accompanied by the sending of the initial and or additional ID information discussed above e.g. with respect to the steps and of . It should be noted that although in the present embodiment it is presumed that the process advances from the step to the step by way of the intermediate steps in some circumstances there will not be any constraints on metadata updating modification and in such embodiments the process can advance directly from the step to the step as represented by the dashed arrow .

Upon the sending of the new modified metadata to the CPWs then at a further step each respective one of the CPWs in turn receives the respective new updated metadata. Such transmission of the new modified metadata is illustrated in by arrows extending from the web server to three of the CPWs . Upon receiving that metadata at the step each one of the respective CPWs that received the metadata stores and implements as appropriate the new updated metadata at a step . It should be understood that the storing and implementing of the new updated metadata at the step reflects any constraints already identified at the step . Thus in the illustration provided in where the second of the CPWs does not support editing location information and the third of the CPWs does not support editing the caption or location information the second CPW is shown as only including Mountains as the title information and Pretty landscape as the caption information while the third CPW is shown as only including Mountains as the title information. By comparison the first one of the CPWs is shown as having implemented all of the requested metadata changes such that it includes Mountains as the title information pertaining to the photo Pretty landscape as the caption information and Colorado as the location information.

Upon completion of the storing and implementing of the new updated metadata at the step the process then advances to a step at which each of the respective ones of the CPWs sends a confirmation or denial notice to the web server regarding that CPW s successful receipt and implementation of the new updated metadata. This confirmation or denial notice can include ID codes such as the initial or additional ID codes discussed above or other ID codes. Upon the web server receiving such confirmation or denial notices from the various CPWs the web server sends that information back to the first one of the mobile devices at a further step . Finally then at a step the first one of the mobile devices receives and displays that confirmation or denial information at which point the process ends at the step .

Turning now to in at least some embodiments of the present invention the system is further able to perform operations by which comments or other input information received by the CPWs in relation to a given photo or other information stored at those CPWs is aggregated or consolidated at the web server . Upon being consolidated at the web server the information can then be further provided to one or more of the mobile devices such as the first one of the mobile devices for presentation to user s of those mobile device s . The information provided to the mobile device s is provided in an organized format that allows for the user s to observe such information received at the multiple CPWs and relating to the same photo or other information in a simplified manner.

In particular shows a flow chart representing a process that begins at a step . Upon starting at the step the respective ones of the CPWs that have each stored a given portion of information provided by a given mobile device such as first one of the mobile devices such as the photo discussed above receive respective comments or other input information all relating to that given portion of information. Such comments can be provided from a variety of sources and typically they are provided by third parties who are different from the user of the first one of the mobile devices but who are nevertheless interacting with the CPWs . For example as illustrated in in one circumstance it is the case that the first one of the CPWs on which is stored the photo has received first and second comments from first and second friends while the second one of the CPWs has received only a first comment from the first friend and the third one of the CPWs has received in relation to the same photo an additional two comments from first and second friends. For purposes of this example it should be understood that the first comments received from the first friend at the different CPWs are actually different respective comments and also that the two comments received from the second friend at the first and third CPWs are different from one another.

As the CPWs receive comments respectively those comments are then sent by the CPWs to the web server at a step as further represented in by arrows . As a result at a step shown at the web server can be said to have received all of the relevant comments or other input information corresponding to a given uploaded photo or other information such as the photo . Although shows the receiving of comments or other input information and the forwarding of such comments or other input information to the web server as singular steps that are each respectively performed by all of the CPWs collectively at once it should be understood nonetheless that typically these steps will in practice be performed on a repeated and ad hoc basis as the various CPWs independently receive comments or other input information and report on an on going basis the arrival of these comments or other input information corresponding to the uploaded photo or other information . Thus the execution of the step of can also be considered to be something which is performed on an ongoing and repeated basis rather than performed only once. Also although not shown in alternate embodiments it is possible that the web server will send out polling requests occasionally to the various CPWs to obtain at respective times in response to the respective polling requests specific updates as of those times from the respective CPWs regarding comments or other input information that have been provided in relation to a given uploaded photo or other information such as the photo . Nevertheless such polling need not be performed in every embodiment and is not performed in the present embodiment.

Upon receiving all of the relevant comments or other input information or on an ongoing basis as more comments are received at a step the web server organizes the received comments. In embodiments where comments are received on an ongoing basis there can be repeated or continual organizing or reorganizing. The manner of organizing can be based upon various criteria such as the source e.g. the CPW from where the various comments have arrived as well as the photo or other information to which those comments pertain. Then at a step the web server sends the comments in the organized format to the mobile device from which the photo or other information to which the comments pertain was originally uploaded e.g. the first one of the mobile devices from which the photo was uploaded. Transmission of this information is represented figuratively in by an arrow .

Finally upon the organized comments being received by the first one of the mobile devices that mobile device at a step displays all of the related comments or other input information from the various CPWs in the organized manner determined by the web server . In the present embodiment the manner of display shows all of the comments corresponding to a particular uploaded photo or other information e.g. the photo shown on in an aggregated format. That is all of the comments from all of the CPWs to which the photo or other information had previously been uploaded are shown together in relation to that photo or other information. One example of such a manner of display is shown in which shows an image that is displayed on the video screen of the first one of the mobile devices from which the photo stored on the CPWs had earlier been uploaded. As shown in this image beneath the photo to which received comments relate are displayed the comments received from the first one of the CPWs . Additionally beneath the comments the comment received from the second of the CPWs and the comments received from the third of the CPWs are shown sequentially. Thus given this manner of presentation the user of the first one of the mobile devices is able to see by virtue of the image all by itself all of the comments from all of the CPWs to which the photo was previously uploaded in relation to that photo and in a manner by which those comments are all viewable yet distinguished from one another on the basis of the CPW from which they came. Upon the displaying of this information at the step the process then ends at an end step .

Notwithstanding the discussion above regarding some embodiments of the present invention the present invention is additionally intended to encompass numerous other embodiments and variations of the above embodiments. For example in some other embodiments server functionality need not be performed by an intermediary server of the communications system that is independent of the mobile devices but rather than can be performed by the mobile devices themselves. Further in this regard as shown in in one such example communications system a given mobile device can directly communicate with the CPWs by way of the communication links where such communication is conducted particularly by way of a server process of the mobile device. The server process can be understood to be an application or applications that is distinct from the other mobile device application s operating on the mobile device and albeit the server process and one or more of the other mobile device application s can be understood as being in communication with one another as represented by a communication link .

In the embodiment of both the server process and the other mobile device application s can be run on the processor and stored in separate regions of the memory albeit in still other embodiments multiple processors processing devices and or multiple memory portions can be employed for the server process and other mobile device application s respectively . Nevertheless the server process can be understood as operating in a manner that is distinct from the other mobile device application s in the same or substantially the same manner as the operation of the intermediary web server of is distinct from the operation of the mobile devices . Further the server process performs the same or substantially the same functions as the server as discussed with reference to . Among other things therefore the server process facilitates the uploading addition deletion editing and aggregation of content. Thus as with the web server the server process serves as an intermediary that allows a mobile device in this case particularly the other mobile device application s of the mobile device to interact with multiple CPWs in a generic or shared manner even though those individual CPWs can have different requirements or manners of operation or have accumulated different information pertaining to a shared topic. Given this manner of operation the server process even though implemented on the mobile device can be considered a server in its own right.

Additionally for example while some embodiments of the present invention provide or employ all of the above described functionality related to the uploading addition deletion editing and aggregation of content other embodiments will employ only portions of the above described functionality. In this regard further for example some embodiments employ the above described functionality involving the uploading addition deletion and editing of content but not the aggregation of content while other embodiments employ the above described functionality involving the aggregation of content but not the uploading addition deletion and editing of content. Additionally for example even though the above discussion largely concerns the mobile devices it should further be understood that the present invention is not intended to be limited to mobile devices or limited to implementation in mobile devices but rather can encompass and be implemented in a variety of other electronic devices such as desktop computers televisions and numerous other devices.

It is specifically intended that the present invention not be limited to the embodiments and illustrations contained herein but include modified forms of those embodiments including portions of the embodiments and combinations of elements of different embodiments as come within the scope of the following claims.
