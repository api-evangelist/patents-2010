The invention described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the United States Government.

This invention relates in general to methods and apparatus for processing compression and transmission of data based upon quantum properties and in particular to high density transmission of data.

Quantum computing represents a revolutionary frontier technology undergoing intense development. Quantum computing for example may render classically intractable computations feasible. In spite of theoretical calculations showing enormous efficiency increases for quantum computers relative to classical computers such improvements have made slow progress. Yet the societal implications of data compression and transmission based on quantum computing algorithms are considerable. Transmission of voice image video and holographic signals in a lossy extremely highly compressed format would impact nearly every field of human endeavor. As the usage of cell phones television signals and internet communications crowds the bandwidth available there exists a need for compression of data communications.

Quantum communication involves qubits which are quantum bits or units of quantum information. A qubit may be visualized by a state vector in a two level quantum mechanical system. Unlike a classical bit which can have the value of zero or one a qubit can have the values of zero or one or a superposition of both. A qubit may be measured in basis states or vectors and a conventional Dirac is used to represent the quantum state values of zero and one herein as for example 0 and 1. The pure qubit state is a linear superposition of those two states can be represented as combination of 0 and 1 or q A 0 B 1 or in generalized form as A 0 and B 1 where Aand Brepresent the corresponding probability amplitudes and A B 1. Unlike classical bits a qubit can exhibit quantum properties such as quantum entanglement which allows for higher correlation than that possible in classical systems. When entangled photon pairs are split the determination of the state such as polarization or angular momentum of one of the entangled photons in effect determines the state of the other of the entangled photon pair since entangle photon pairs are the conjugates of one another. An example of a visualization of a series of qubits is depicted in a schematic depicting a prior art three qubit quantum binary tree to illustrate an information storage index space equivalency to eight classical bits. The quantum binary tree of is depicted for 3 qubits which provides an index space of 8.

The present inventive method allows for the transmission of information over a path wherein the data or information is first converted to qubits. A quantum tree formed of qubits is depicted in A B and C. In the example shown 3 qubits are used. However the number of qubits may be changed without departing from the scope and principles of the present invention. As the first qubit is transmitted a measurement takes place and the result is inputted into computer illustrated in et seq. Based upon this measurement as illustrated by the decision tree of either the left L or right R portion of qubit is not used or transmitted . Following the transmission of the portion of qubit another measurement takes place and the result is inputted into computer . Based upon this measurement as illustrated by the decision tree of either branch A or A is followed. In the example shown in where the first and second measured values were zeroes the qubit portions represented by the nodes at the dotted line branches are unused and not transmitted.

Due to the properties of the qubits a preferred embodiment system employs the quantum Fourier transform QFT and a classical or quantum inverse Fourier transform in the measurement process. Data inputted in the form of a wave function generated using for example amplitudes of a given signal is converted into a quantum state or qubits over which in a preferred embodiment of the present invention transforms such as the quantum Fourier transform QFT operate. The conversion of the wave function to a quantum state represented by qubits is described for example in GuiLong Yang Sun Efficient scheme for initializing a quantum register with an arbitrary superposed state Physical Review A Volume 64 014303 hereby incorporated by reference . The quantum Fourier transform is implemented by a series of optical elements implementing quantum operations followed by a measurement as described for example in Robert B. Griffiths et al. Semiclassical Fourier Transform for Quantum Computation Physical Review Letters Apr. 22 1996 hereby incorporated by reference . Although a particular embodiment is described other equivalent formulations processes and configurations are encompassed within the scope of the invention.

In terms of data flow a preferred methodology comprises splitting a wave function representative of an input data set into an arbitrarily oriented elliptical polarization state and a comparator wave function state the comparator wave function state being transmitted to a detector. In a preferred embodiment a quantum Fourier transform is performed on the arbitrarily oriented elliptical polarization state to yield a quantum computational product. A quantum Hadamard transform is performed on the quantum computational product to yield one of two possible quantum particle outputs. Through feedback circuitry the input data set is processed based upon the coincident arrival of the comparator wave function state and one of the two quantum particle outputs. Data compression and transmission in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention may be performed on either a quantum computer or a digital computer.

A data communication system operating on quantum computation principles includes a light source having a photon output coding an input data set. A Type I or Type II nonlinear crystal converts the photon output into an entangled photon output. An arbitrarily oriented polarization state is assured by passing the entangled photon output through a polarization modulator and a phase modulator . A polarization interferometer performs a controlled phase shift transform on the arbitrarily oriented polarization state as an interferometer output. A halfwave plate then performs a quantum. Hadamard gate transform to generate one of two possible photon states from the interferometer output thus completing the operations required for a quantum Fourier transform. Coincidence electronics reconstruct the input data set a distance from the light source. The reconstruction is based on the coincident arrival of the one of two possible photon states and at least one of the entangled photon output or the interferometer output. The result is then fed back via computer and associated circuitry whereupon the computer in conjunction with polarization modulator and a phase modulator based upon the branch determinations processes only portions of the succeeding qubits resulting in reduction in the amount of data which is transmitted.

The present invention has utility in data transmission. A quantum computing algorithm for processing data has greater than classical efficiency when run on a quantum computer. It is appreciated that an embodiment of the present invention comprises a method for data compression and transmission that is operative in a classical digital computing environment although without the superior speed and information storage properties of qubits that are realized on a quantum computer. While the present invention is hereafter detailed in the context of sound compression and transmission it is appreciated that data corresponding to any number of media are equally well suited for transmission in a highly compressed and lossy manner such as light transmission. Data set types other than sound readily transmitted according to the present invention illustratively include images video holograms digital instrument output and numerical streams.

A preferred embodiment of the present invention includes a system for the transmission and reconstruction of a data set through the utilization of a quantum Fourier transform QFT operation on qubits coding the data set.

A preferred embodiment of the present invention prepares a wave function in a n data set as described for example in Long and Sun Efficient scheme for initializing a quantum register with an arbitrary superposed state Physical Review A vol. 64 Issue 1 014303 2001 hereinafter Long and Sun . In Long and Sun a scheme is presented that can most generally initialize a quantum register with an arbitrary superposition of basis states as a step in quantum computation and quantum information processing. For example Long and Sun went beyond a simple quantum state such as i ii . . . i with ibeing either 0 or 1 to construct an arbitrary superposed quantum state. Long and Sun utilize the implementation of O Nn standard 1 and 2 bit gate operations without introducing additional quantum bits. The terminology arbitrary superposed quantum state as used herein correlates to the construction of an arbitrary superposed quantum state as described inter glia in Long and Sun. 

As depicted in a series of optical elements are provided to act as quantum operators followed by a measurement to implement the quantum Fourier transform. R. B. Griffiths C. S. Niu 76 3328 3231 1996 . An optical bench with appropriate electronics is well suited to function as a quantum computer for the compression and transmission of data corresponding to sound. Those of ordinary skill in the art can appreciate that although an optical bench is described as the platform for generating and performing operations on qubits it is appreciated that three plus qubit quantum computers are known to the art based on ion trapping and the nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer.

An inventive quantum computing system has been developed for data processing. The data set amplitudes such as sound amplitudes are represented by a quantum wave function. The wave function is in turn coded into the qubits of quantum particles. Preferably the quantum particles are photons but trapped ions or magnetic spin states can also be utilized to practice the principles of the present invention.

In the practice of the present invention on a classical computer the data series that for illustrative purposes is a sound is broken into a series of segments each represented by the number of qubits that the classical computer can store and compute. In a quantum computer the quantum particles preferably photons are operated on by optical components to perform the inventive method steps.

The method of the present invention relies on the use of qubits in a quantum computer or the simulation of qubits in a classical computer. Qubits comprise superpositions of ones and zeros where both simultaneously exist. Photons that define the wave function are subjected to a quantum Fourier transform operation. In the process the photons are measured thereby destroying the quantum state but providing the measured probability in terms of the wave function and its complex conjugate 1 

An inverse Fourier transform FT is then applied to the square root of the measured probability to recover a lossy intelligible data compression in the form of quantum particle detection. It is appreciated that the inverse Fourier transform may be either a classical or quantum transform. A classical fast Fourier transform is readily performed by optical bench elements or through a classical computer program. The forward and inverse transforms are conducted using a relatively small sample of the wave function Fourier modes which has the property of preserving much of the intelligibility of the data while providing a compression and communication efficiency. Using the quantum computing simulation of a classical computer according to the present invention a sound data set for example is intelligibly reproduced with a lossy compression factor over a classical computation. Computational efficiency with the present invention increases in the case of an increasing set of qubits. In practice the inventive method allows for the transmission of information over a long path using a small number of photons. Data transmission with a small number of photons carrying the data in a quantum particle form is amenable to free optical path transmission through air or vacuum through optical fibers and via satellite transmission. As a result a first location remote from a second location is retained in communication therebetween with the transmission of a comparatively small number of qubits of quantum particles relative to the data exchanged. Photons are amenable to transit in an environment exposed to climactic weather between the locations. It is appreciated that co linear transmission of a comparator wave function state and an information carrying state facilitates long range data transmission.

According to the present invention a data set is modeled by or in the form of a wave function. By way of example a sound is characterized by intensity amplitudes at uniformly spaced intervals

A superimposed quantum form is applied to the sound data set to facilitate quantum computer manipulation. To accomplish the quantification data amplitudes are equated to a wave function in the form of a series

is the quantum state key. The qubits are characterized as the quantum state superpositions 0 1. 6 A quantum probability conservation condition is imposed such that 1. 7 

To account for the quantum superposition the quantum data is organized in terms of a conventional quantum binary tree. A prior art quantum binary tree is depicted as a branching between 0 and 1 outcomes for successive steps in . Using the qubit representation shown in the first step is to determine whether a one or zero exists at the first branch located at the top of the triangle depicted in . If a zero value is present Branch A is followed and the right side of the triangle or the Branch B becomes unnecessary to future determinations. Elimination of the B Branch results in data compression. is a depiction of the second level branching following the determination depicted to the left in . If the value is zero Branch A is followed. If the value is one Branch A is followed. In each case the other branch is eliminated resulting in data compression. is a depiction of the third level branching following the determination depicted to the left in . If the value is zero Branch A is followed. If the value is one Branch A is followed. In each case the other branch is eliminated resulting in further data compression. The particular values selected for depiction in are merely exemplary. Results a one determination at first level are not shown in to make the diagram easier to follow. Results of a one determination at the second level are not shown in to make the diagram easier to follow.

The outcomes of the successive steps sum to the values 0 through 2 1 where n is the number of qubits. The means of obtaining the 0 or 1 depends on the specific experimental and corresponding simulation implementation. There are several conventional rules that are possible for determining the 0 or 1 value. For example a 0 state may correspond to a horizontal measurement and the 1 may correspond to a vertical measurement or the reverse may be true. In general the series of qubit measurements are prepared such that each value of the state preparation is conditioned to determine the 0 or 1 at each branch. An alternate qubit architecture operative herein is termed winner take all. In the simulation depicted in n qubit measurements are made. The n value is determinative of the first branch. The 2 are divided into two parts lower 0 to 2 2 1 and higher indices 2 2 to 2 1. The side with the greatest sum of the indices measured determines the path of the first branch. The second level branch has one half the number of indices of the first branch. Consecutive indices assigned are from the selected half from the first branch. The same process is used for the second branch level as from the first branch but with half of the indices. This process repeats until all the branching is determined and the selected single index is determined. The quantum binary tree depicted in prior art for three qubits provides an index space of eight. The quantum binary tree is expandable to n qubits which is equivalent to an index space of 2over which transforms such as the QFT operate.

The quantum superposition amplitudes at any qubit level in the binary tree may be constructed from sound amplitudes

Superpositions of qubits are used to store and process data such as sound. The amplitude of the data can be stored as the amplitudes of a superposed quantum state . 15 where k is the eigenstate of . The term can be decomposed as a direct product of qubits q . . . q 16 which compacts storage requirements by a factor of log 2 relative to a classical computation. A data set of size 2can be stored and operated on in n quantum bits. Mathematical transforms can also be performed on the quantum stored signal with the associated computational savings.

According to the present invention data compression and transmission are preferably performed using photons as quantum particle qubits. Various system configurations are depicted in accompanying where like numerals described with reference to subsequent figures correspond to previously detailed elements.

Referring now to an inventive system is depicted generally at . A data encoder converts the data set to a set of photonic qubits that satisfies the expression of Equation 15 and triggers a light source accordingly. Preferably the light source is a laser. Exemplary lasers operative herein illustratively include Nd YAG ion lasers diode lasers excimer lasers dye lasers and frequency modified lasers. Photons emitted from the light source are optionally passed through a spatial filter . Filter converts the photons in an image space domain to a spatial frequency domain and serves the purpose of removing for example stripe noise of low frequency and or high frequency noise. The noise associated with system fluctuations illustratively including line noise powering the light source thermal gradients detector noise and inherent quantum noise. The photons having passed through spatial filter are then passed through a Type II nonlinear optics crystal . Type II nonlinear optic crystals are well known to the art and illustratively include potassium dihydrogen phosphate potassium titanyl phosphate beta barium borate cesium lithium borate and adamantyl amino nitro pyridine. A dichroic mirror is used to selectively reflect out of the beam path those photons that have changed wavelength as a result of passing through the crystal . A beam stop blocks the path of photons . The entangled photons are split by interaction with a polarization beam splitter . The entangled photons are split into a known photon state and a comparator wave function state . The comparator wave function state is directed onto a single photon counting module by an optional mirror set . It is appreciated that a reorganization of beam paths in the system obviates the need for mirror set . The detection of the comparator wave function state by the single photon counting module is fed to coincidence electronics and is used to reconstruct the data set. The known photon state is then passed through a polarization modulator and a phase modulator . Exemplary polarization phase modulators illustratively include liquid crystals Kerr cells and Pockel cells. Preferably a series of two liquid crystal devices and a quarter wave plate are used to achieve arbitrary polarization. Upon the known photon state interacting with the polarization and phase modulators and respectively the known photon state is transformed into an arbitrarily oriented elliptical polarization state based on the data set signal being transformed and any previously measured photon state if any is known. The arbitrarily oriented elliptical polarization state is optionally reflected from a mirror and then enters a polarization interferometer depicted generally at . The interferometer depicted has the geometry of a polarization Mach Zehnder interferometer and includes a polarization beam splitter that transmits one portion to a phase modulator resulting in a phase shift in the light component reaching polarization beam splitter relative to the other polarization component . Polarization beam splitter recombines beam components and to complete a controlled phase shift transform on the recombined state from the interferometer . Ancillary mirrors collectively numbered are provided to reflect light in desired directions. The controlled phase shift transformed light component representing a recombined phase state then interacts with a half wave plate oriented at 22.5 degrees in order to implement a quantum Hadamard gate transformation therein and thus complete a quantum Fourier transform. The half wave plate provides a qubit prioritized input to a polarization beam splitter .

The process that computes the Quantum Fourier Transform QFT of a signal may be described as follows. First the computer or device that holds the signal divides the signal into a series of sections. Each section contains N samples of the signal. This section of N samples is then used to prepare the first qubit of the quantum state using a prescribed technique for the QFT. This quantum state is then passed though a device that applies a particular phase shift appropriate to this qubit of the QFT. The qubit is then measured and the result of that measurement is recorded as a 0 or 1. This measurement is also used to determine which half of the N samples of the current signal section are used as a subsection to prepare the next qubit the other half is not needed to prepare the next qubit. This qubit and all the remaining qubits generated for the original signal section are prepared and measured in a similar way with each qubit measurement using only half of the remaining signal subsection to prepare the next qubit. This process ends when the last qubit that is prepared using only 2 samples of the signal section. When all these qubits have been measured for one section we have a binary number that tells us to add 1 to the bin addressed by that binary number for instance the binary number 010 would indicate address 2 and the binary number 110 would indicate address 6. These steps are repeated a number of times on the same signal section to generate a power spectrum representation of the signal section. Signal processing techniques such as a classical inverse Fourier transform or compressive sensing sampling can used on this power spectrum to reconstruct the initial signal section in a lossy but still recognizable manner.

In the QFT a number of photons each with prepared qubit states are sent sequentially through quantum controlled phase transforms followed by quantum Hadamard transforms. The state preparation is accomplished by setting the values of the phase and setting the photons to particular elliptical polarization values.

The Hadamard transform is a quantum transform operating on one qubit at a time. The Hadamard gate transform is given as

The initial state of each photon qubit is conditioned on the measured values of each photon that went before.

A single photon is operated upon by a Hadamard transform with the effect of Hadamard transforms on multiple photons representing an entire wave function is represented by the combined Hadamard transform.

The total wave function made of arbitrary superposed states is operated on by the combined Hadamard transform 19 where 20 Here the direct product of the identities is repeated until all of the qubits are taken into account.

Single photon counting modules and count individual photons with a given polarization and report a counting event to coincidence electronics . Only when coincidence is noted between a photon counting event at module and or between module and module is the count considered a valid probability density function measurement. The probability density function is defined by 21 and sets the number of times on the average that a photon lands in an indexed space interval. For n qubits there are 2indexed space intervals.

A determination as to the polarization of each photon is provided by signal measurement at one of the single photon counting modules and . The polarization of each photon is measured at the end of the photon path through the Hadamard gate and electro optics. If horizontal 0 then no phase operations applies to the remaining qubits. Otherwise a controlled phase operation Ris applied to remaining operations. The Rset is defined as

The term n represents the distance between the nindices of the binary tree levels under consideration 23 

The output of an inventive system is provided to a buffer store. From the buffer store it may be provided to an output device on either a real time or delayed basis as still images video images movies audio sound representations and the like.
