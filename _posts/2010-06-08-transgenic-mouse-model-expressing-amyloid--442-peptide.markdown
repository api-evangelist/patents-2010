The present invention describes a novel transgenic mouse model for the common sporadic form of Alzheimer s disease. More particularly the invention relates to a nucleotide sequence encoding A 4 42 in functional linkage with at least a promoter signal peptide sequence and a polyadenylation signal sequence a cell and a transgenic non human animal comprising said nucleotide sequence and their respective use in screening methods.

Alzheimer disease AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the presence of extracellular amyloid plaques composed of amyloid A surrounded by dystrophic neurites and neurofibrillary tangles. The discovery that certain early onset familial forms of AD may be caused by an enhanced production of A peptides have led to the hypothesis that amyloidogenic A is intimately involved in the AD pathogenic process.

The generation of A peptides is due to enzymatic cleavage of the larger amyloid precursor protein APP which represents a type I membrane protein with a large N terminal ectodomain and a short intracellular C terminal domain. Alternative splicing of APP yields eight isoforms with lengths of 677 770 amino acid residues of which APP695 is the primary transcript in neurons. APP can be processed by two different pathways i nonamyloidogenic processing Cleavage by secretase within the A domain releases a secreted form of APP sAPP thereby precluding the generation of toxic A peptides. Different members of the ADAM protein family a disintegrin and metalloprotease have been demonstrated to possess secretase activity. ii Amyloidogenic processing This APP processing pathway results in cleavage at the secretase site liberating also a secreted form of APP sAPP and leading to the generation of a membrane associated C terminal fragment named C99. The site APP cleaving enzyme 1 BACE belongs to the family of aspartyl proteases. Subsequent cleavage of C99 by secretase activity results in the generation of 40 42 residue A peptides as well as a short intracellular APP fragment named AICD. It has been shown that secretase consists of a complex of different proteins including presenilin 1 PS1 or presenilin 2 PS2 as well as nicastrin anterior pharynx defective APH 1 and presenilin enhancer 2 PEN 2 .

Mutations in either APP or in the presenilin genes have been linked to familiar early onset forms of AD FAD . These cases represent only a minor portion 5 whereas the vast majority of AD cases develop sporadically sporadic form of AD . Most of the reported APP mutations are located near the secretase cleavage sites and lead to an overproduction of A peptides. Some of these mutations e.g. the Austrian mutation T714I as well as a couple of PS1 mutations have a drastic effect on the A 42 A 40 ratio by strongly increasing A 42 production with concomitant suppression of 40 secretion.

A accumulation has an important function in the etiology of AD with its typical clinical symptoms like memory impairment and changes in personality. Even though it has been observed that A localizes predominantly to abnormal endosomes multivesicular bodies and within pre and postsynaptic compartments the mode of this toxic activity is still a matter of scientific debate.

A promising experimental approach to unravel the role of A in AD pathology has been the generation of transgenic mice overexpressing the amyloid precursor protein APP . All mouse models mimic the typical AD like pathological deficits in synaptic transmission changes in behaviour differential glutamate responses and deficits in long term potentiation. In addition learning deficits and reduced brain volume were evident in transgenic APP models. These characteristics are generally attributed to the overexpression of full length amyloid precursor protein APP . Although learning deficits were evident in various APP models the extent of A amyloid deposition did not correlate with the behavioural phenotype Holcomb L. A. et al. 1999 29 177 185 Wirths O. et al. 2008 29 891 901 . These deficits occurred well before plaque deposition became prominent and may therefore reflect early pathological changes likely induced by intraneuronal APP A mistrafficking or intraneuronal A accumulation reviewed in Bayer T. A. and Wirths O. 2008 7 Suppl 1 6 11 .

N terminal deletions in general enhance aggregation of amyloid peptides in vitro. For example Kuo et al 2001 276 12991 12998 have used an integrated chemical and morphological comparison of the A peptides and amyloid plaques present in the brains of APP23 transgenic mice and human AD patients. The lack of posttranslational modifications such as N terminal degradation isomerization racemization and pyroglutamyl formation of A in APP23 mice provides an explanation for the differences in solubility of A from human AD and transgenic mouse plaques.

Besides A peptides starting with an aspartate at position 1 a variety of different N truncated A peptides have been identified in AD brains. Ragged peptides including those beginning with phenylalanine at position 4 of A have been reported as early as 1985 by Masters et al. 82 4245 4249 . In addition other N terminal truncated peptides have been identified like A Takeda K. et al. 2004 18 1755 1757 A Liu K. et al. 2006 . 112 163 174 Lee E. B. et al. 2003 278 4458 4466 and Flemish and Dutch N terminally truncated amyloid beta peptides Demeester N. et al. 2001 13 2015 2024 . Although A peptides have been observed in neuronal cultures and in the brains of patients with AD the involvement of these peptides in its pathogenesis remains elusive Cai H. et al. 2001 4 233 234 .

Moreover N truncated A peptides have been identified by several groups from AD brains Kuo et al. supra and a new mouse model was generated TBA2 expressing only N truncated A in neurons Wirths O et al. 2009 118 487 96 . The TBA2 mice have a glutamate to glutamine substitution at position 3 of A which is prone to form A . A has a higher aggregation propensity and stability and shows an increased toxicity compared to full length A . This model demonstrated that this peptide is neurotoxic in vivo inducing neuron loss and an associated neurological phenotype. Similarly US 2009 0098052 A1 and WO 2009 034158 disclose transgenic mice wherein the transgene encodes various mutant A 3 40 and A 3 42 peptides.

It was demonstrated that in another transgenic mouse model Tg2576 A peptides lacked a pronounced N terminal degradation posttranslational modifications and cross linkages that were frequently observed in the compact A peptide deposits found in AD brain. Thus under in vivo conditions truncated A molecules appeared to be generated by hydrolysis at multiple sites rather than by post mortem N terminal degradation.

Moreover it was shown that the APP PS1KI mouse model develops severe learning deficits at six months of age correlating with a CA1 neuron loss and an atrophy of the hippocampus Casas C et al. 2004 165 1289 1300 Breyhan H. et al. 2009 117 677 685 together with a drastic reduction of long term potentiation and disrupted paired pulse facilitation coinciding with intraneuronal aggregation of N terminal modified A variants Breyhan H. 2009 117 677 685 . Notably the APP PS1KI mouse model exhibits a large heterogeneity of N truncated A variants Casas et al. supra . This was accompanied by reduced levels of pre and post synaptic markers.

In addition the inventors have reported that intraneuronal A rather than extracellular plaque pathology correlates with neuron loss in the hippocampus the frontal cortex and the cholinergic system of APP PS1KI mice expressing transgenic human mutant APP751 including the Swedish and London mutations on a murine knock in KI Presenilin 1 PS1 background with two FAD linked mutations PS1and PS1 .

By using mouse models expressing full length APP and after cleavage also C terminal fragments and A peptides it is difficult to decipher the pathological function of specific A peptides. In addition all transgenic lines harbour mutations either from AD families for example the APP PS1KI or the 5 FAD mice or an artificial one as in the TBA2 mice.

All previously reported mouse models with synaptic dysfunction neuron degeneration and behavioural deficits are based on transgenic constructs with artificial mutations or from inherited familial AD cases. In other words existing models are based on autosomal dominant mutations in APP and the presenilin genes which represent models for the rare familial AD FAD forms only. Accordingly there is still a need for a model for the common sporadic form of AD.

In a first aspect the invention relates to a nucleic acid molecule comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein consisting of the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 1 A 4 42 in functional linkage with at least a promoter signal peptide sequence and a polyadenylation signal sequence.

In a second aspect the invention relates to a cell comprising the nucleic acid molecule according to the first aspect.

Further in a third aspect the invention pertains to a transgenic non human animal comprising the nucleic acid molecule according to the first aspect and or the cell according to the second aspect.

The inventors have recently shown that intraneuronal accumulation of A peptides induces severe neuron loss and associated neurological phenotypes in diverse mouse model for Alzheimer disease AD . Given the increasing interest in mouse models for sporadic AD the inventors have generated four different lines of transgenic mice expressing A 4 42 TBA8 transgenic mice under the control of the neuron specific Thy1 promoter. This is the first mouse model without any mutations showing neurological deficits. The mice accumulate abundant intraneuronal A peptides in hippocampus CA1 cortical pyramidal neurons spinal cord pons and several subcortical nuclei. The presence of extracellular plaques proves that the peptides are secreted however the majority of A peptides accumulate within neurons. Previously the inventors have demonstrated in other transgenic mouse models representing familial AD that intraneuronal accumulation of A peptides are the major trigger for neuron loss and associated behavioural deficits.

In conclusion the TBA8 model disclosed herein represents a mouse model for the common sporadic form of AD as the neurological phenotype is due to wild type A peptide aggregation. TBA8 mice harbour no mutation in the coding region of A but start with a naturally occurring N terminal truncation of the first three amino acids of A Masters C. L. et al. 1985 4 2757 2763 Portelius E. et al. 2010 DOI 10.1007 s00401 010 0690 1 . Since it is known that models based on autosomal dominant mutations in APP and the presenilin genes represent only models for the rare familial AD forms the TBA8 mice having no mutation represent a model for the common sporadic form of AD.

Accordingly in a first aspect the invention relates to a nucleic acid molecule comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a protein consisting of the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 1 A 4 42 in functional linkage with at least a promoter signal peptide sequence and a polyadenylation signal sequence.

Said A 4 42 originates from human APP and although it has been found in plaques of AD patients together with other A peptides its exclusive pathological role was not known. Specifically SEQ ID NO 1 represents an N truncated wild type A peptide ranging from position 4 to 42 of the human wild type A peptide.

The nucleic acid molecule may consist of any nucleic acid capable of comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding A 4 42 such as single stranded or double stranded DNA the sense or antisense strand of a DNA molecule or RNA molecules and the like. The person skilled in the art knows how to derive a polynucleotide sequence coding for a protein and how to isolate or produce a nucleic acid sequence using standard techniques of molecular biology. Further the nucleotide sequence may also be adapted to the codon usage of the host intended to be transfected with the nucleotide sequence.

The nucleotide sequence is in functional linkage with at least a promoter signal peptide sequence and a polyadenylation signal sequence. However the nucleotide sequence may be in functional linkage with further control sequences that facilitate expression of the A 4 42 peptide.

The nucleic acid molecule encoding the A 4 42 peptide may be included in an expression construct such as a vector plasmid virus phagemid artificial chromosome cosmid and further constructs known to the skilled person in order to provide for expression of the A 4 42 peptide. Such an expression vector may further comprise a selectable marker which provides for positive selection of transfected cells i.e. transfected cells exhibit resistance to the selection and are able to grow whereas non transfected cells generally die. Examples of selective markers include puromycin zeocin neomycin neo and hygromycin B which confer resistance to puromycin zeocin amino glycoside G 418 and hygromycin respectively. However other selection methods known to the skilled person may also be suitable. Moreover such a vector or plasmid may contain elements that permit stable integration of the nucleotide sequence into a host s genome or autonomous replication of the nucleotide sequence independent of the genome.

Techniques for modifying nucleic acid sequences for insertion into a vector e.g. by utilizing recombinant DNA methods are also well known in the art. Generally an expression vector comprises the polynucleotide to be expressed which is operably linked to one or more control sequences e.g. promoter transcriptional stop signal translational stop signal stop codon etc. capable of directing the expression of the peptide in the desired host cell. The promoter may be any nucleic acid sequence showing transcriptional activity in the host cell of choice. The promoter can be an inducible or constitutive general or tissue or cell specific promoter. In a preferred embodiment the promoter is an inducible promoter.

The term inducible promoter relates to any promoter capable of being turned on or off by a regulatory compound or a certain physical stimulus. Inducible promoters are for example the lac or tac promoters the phosphate inducible phoA promoter or the metallothionein promoter. Further examples of inducible promoters are known to the skilled person.

In a preferred embodiment the promoter is a tissue or cell specific promoter more preferably a neuron specific promoter. The terms tissue specific and cell specific are intended to mean that a majority of the peptide is expressed in the preferred cell or tissue. However it will be understood by the skilled person that a little unintended expression will also occur in other tissues or cells. In still another embodiment the tissue or cell specific promoter may be endogenous to the host i.e. a promotor which naturally occurs in the host s genome. Alternatively the promoter may be heterogenous to the host. In one preferred embodiment the promoter is Thy 1 neuron specific enolase NSE promotor the promoter of the prion protein or of PDGF beta more preferably the promoter is Thy 1 or NSE and most preferably the promoter is Thy 1. The NSE promoter is known to the skilled person from many publications in the field.

The signal peptide sequence is a nucleotide sequence that codes for an amino acid sequence linked to the N terminal end of the A 4 42 peptide in order to facilitate the expression and intracellular trafficking of the peptide. However any signal peptide sequence is cleaved from the A 4 42 peptide thereby releasing the mature A 4 42 peptide. Effective signal peptide sequences are known in the art. In a preferred embodiment the signal peptide ist the murine pre pro TRH signal sequence. Another suitable signal sequence is also included in the Thy1.2 expression cassette as described in cf. Caroni P 1997 71 1 3 9 .

A polyadenylation signal sequence is a sequence in functional linkage with the 3 terminus of the nucleotide sequence encoding the A 4 42 peptide and which when transcribed is recognized by the host as a signal to add polyadenosine residues to the transcribed mRNA. Any polyadenylation signal sequence which is functional in the intended host may be used.

The nucleotide sequence may also contain a leader sequence a nontranslated part of an mRNA which is important for translation by the host. The leader sequence is in functional linkage with the 5 terminus of the nucleotide sequence encoding the A 4 42 peptide. Any leader sequence that is functional in the host of choice may be used.

Suitable promoters signal peptide sequences polyadenylation signals and other useful or necessary control sequences and in particular the Thy 1 expression cassette are well known in the art cf. Caroni P 1997 supra . The selection of promoters vectors and other elements is a matter of routine design within the level of ordinary skill in the art and many different such control sequences are described in the literature and available through commercial suppliers. Generally the choice of the vector will typically depend on the choice of the host cell into which the vector will be introduced.

In a second aspect the invention relates to a cell comprising the nucleic acid molecule described above.

The nucleic acid molecule e.g. comprised in an expression vector may be introduced into cells by various ways e.g. using a virus as a carrier or by transfection including e.g. by chemical transfectants such as Lipofectamine Fugene etc. electroporation calcium phosphate co precipitation and direct diffusion of DNA. Suitable transfection techniques are known to the skilled person and the method of choice will vary depending on the host cell to be transfected. Transfection of a cell may yield stable cells or cell lines if the transfected polynucleotide or expression vector is integrated into the genome or by using episomal replicating plasmids i.e. that the inheritance of the extrachromosomal plasmid is controlled by control elements that are integrated into the cell genome. In addition unstable transient cells or cell lines wherein the transfected DNA exists in an extrachromosomal form can be produced. In a preferred embodiment the nucleic acid molecule or at least the part encoding A 4 42 is introduced into the cell by pronuclear injection.

The cell may be maintained and cultured at an appropriate temperature and gas mixture typically 37 C. 5 CO optionally in a cell incubator as known to the skilled person. Culture conditions may vary for each cell type and variation of conditions for a particular cell type can result in different phenotypes. Furthermore recipes for growth media can vary in pH glucose concentration growth factors and the presence of further suitable nutrient components. Growth media are commercially available or can be prepared according to compositions which are for example obtainable from the American Tissue Culture Collection ATCC . Growth factors used for supplement media are often derived from animal blood such as calf serum but also other probably cell specific growth factors may be enclosed. Additionally antibiotics may be added to the growth media to prevent undesired microbial growth.

In general the cell may be any kind of cell such as for example an isolated cell. For the expression and purification of the nucleotide sequence and the A 4 42 peptide of the invention a prokaryotic cell may be used such as an strain. However for other purposes including the methods described herein a eukaryotic cell or cell line may be used. Many cell lines which may be used in the invention are commercially available from culture collection such as the ATCC or from other commercial suppliers.

In a preferred embodiment the cell is a vertebrate cell preferably a mammalian cell. In a more preferred embodiment the cell is a rodent cell such as a mouse or a rat cell. In another more preferred embodiment the cell is a primate cell or a non human embryonic stem cell such as a fertilized oocyte. In still another preferred embodiment the cell is an adult stem cell. In another preferred embodiment the cell may be a conventional cell used in screening processes such as a Hela cell Cos cell CHO cell or HEK cell. In a most preferred embodiment the cell is a neuronal cell. In another most preferred embodiment the cell is a neuroblastoma cell such as a SY5Y or an N2a cell. It is also preferred that the cell does not comprise a nucleotide sequence encoding for a non wt human APP or non wt human presenilin i.e. that the cell does not comprise a nucleotide sequence encoding APP and or presenilin having a mutation known to be associated with familiar Alzheimer s disease FAD . It is noted that those cells or cell lines particularly human embryonic stem or germline cells are excluded which are not subject to patentability under the respective patent law or jurisdiction.

In a further aspect the invention provides a transgenic non human animal comprising the nucleic acid molecule and or the cell according to the invention. The transgenic non human animal may be any animal other than a human. In a preferred embodiment the transgenic non human animal is a vertebrate preferably a mammal more preferably a rodent such as a mouse or a rat or a primate.

In particular some model organisms are preferred such as usually the species and . Among vertebrates these are several rodent species such as guinea pig hamster mouse and rat as well as other species such as chicken cat dog Lamprey Japanese ricefish Rhesus macaque zebra finch pufferfish african clawed frog and zebrafish . Also preferred are non human primates i.e. all species of animals under the order Primates that are not a member of the genus for example rhesus macaque chimpanzee baboon marmoset and green monkey. However these examples are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.

In a preferred embodiment the transgenic non human animal is heterozygous for the nucleic acid molecule. In another preferred embodiment the transgenic non human animal is homozygous for the nucleic acid molecule.

However it is noted that those animals are excluded which are not likely to yield in substantial medical benefit to man or animal and which are therefore not subject to patentability under the respective patent law or jurisdiction. Moreover the skilled person will take appropriate measures as e.g. laid down in international guidelines of animal welfare to ensure that the substantial medical benefit to man or animal will outweigh any animal suffering.

Such a transgenic non human animal may serve as a model system for Alzheimer s disease AD in particular the sporadic form of AD. However since A peptides are linked to diseases associated with amyloidogenesis and or amyloid plaque formation such as Down Syndrome Mild Cognitive Impairment cerebral amyloid angiopathy dementia Lewy body dementia hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis Dutch type Familial Danish Dementia and Familial British Dementia vascular dementia motor neuropathy Creutzfeld Jacob disease Parkinson s disease HIV related dementia ALS or neuronal disorders related to aging it is also contemplated that the transgenic non human animal of the invention may also be useful as a model system in said diseases.

Likewise it is also contemplated that the cell of the invention or the transgenic non human animal according to the invention may also be used in a method of identifying a candidate substance for the treatment of Down Syndrome Mild Cognitive Impairment cerebral amyloid angiopathy dementia Lewy body dementia hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis Dutch type Familial Danish Dementia and Familial British Dementia motor neuropathy Creutzfeld Jacob disease Parkinson s disease HIV related dementia ALS or neuronal disorders related to aging.

Accordingly in still another aspect the invention provides a method of identifying a candidate substance for the treatment of AD preferably the sporadic form of AD the method comprising

Suitable test are described for example in Wirths O et al. 2007 Age dependent axonal degeneration in an Alzheimer mouse model. 28 1689 1699 Wirths O et al. 2010 Inflammatory changes are tightly associated with neurodegeneration in the brain and spinal cord of the APP PS1KI mouse model of Alzheimer s disease. 31 5 747 757 Schmitz C et al. 2004 Hippocampal neuron loss exceeds amyloid plaque load in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer s disease. 164 4 1495 1502 Breyhan H et al. 2009 APP PS1KI bigenic mice develop early synaptic deficits and hippocampus atrophy. 117 6 677 685 Wirths O et al. 2008 Deficits in working memory and motor performance in the APP PS1ki mouse model for Alzheimer s disease. 29 6 891 901 Bayer T A et al. 2003 Dietary Cu stabilizes brain SOD 1 activity and reduces amyoid A production in APP23 transgenic mice. 100 24 14187 14192.

The amyloid beta peptide 4 42 was expressed as fusion protein with the pre pro sequence of murine thyrotropin releasing hormone TRH to be released by a prohormone convertase as described earlier 1 . The cDNA of human wildtype APP was used to generate the sequence for A 1 42 and subsequently the first nine nucleotides representing the first N terminal three amino acids of A 1 42 were deleted by site directed mutagenesis Stratagene QuikChange II Site directed mutagenesis Kit Cat. No 200523 generating A 4 42. The sequence of A 4 42 was fused to the 3 end of the signal peptide of the murine TRH as described earlier Cynis H et al. 2006 1764 10 1618 1625 . The respective cDNA was inserted into the pUC18 vector containing the murine Thy 1.2 sequence applying standard molecular biology techniques and verified by sequencing. The transgenic mice were generated by male pronuclear injection of fertilized C57B1 6J oocytes. The resulting offspring were further characterized for transgene integration by PCR analysis and after crossing to C57B1 6J wild type mice for transgene expression by RT PCR. The lines with highest transgene mRNA expression were selected for further breeding named TBA82 TBA83 TBA86 TBA88 . All animals were handled according to German guidelines for animal care.

In addition to A starting with aspartate at position 1 A 1 42 one major A species in AD brain starts at position 4 with phenylalanine A 4 42 . We generated a novel mouse model expressing A 4 42 under the control of the murine Thy 1.2 promoter. Eight transgenic founder lines were obtained and crossed with C57B16 wildtype mice. Four founders giving offspring were further examined by RT PCR in order to identify the lines with the highest expression levels.

Four transgenic founders were isolated. mRNA expression levels in brain were quantified by RT PCR as follows.

Total RNA was prepared using TriFast peqlab Germany Cat. Nr 30 2010 . RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit Fermentas GmbH Cat. Nr K1612 . Quantitative real time RT PCR was performed using a Stratagene MX3000P Real Time Cycler. For quantification the DyNamo Flash SYBR Green qPCR Kit containing ROX as an internal reference dye Finnzymes Finland Cat. Nr F 415L was used. Specific oligonucleotide primers for TBA8 mRNA and actin were purchased from Eurofins MWG Operon Germany or Qiagen Qiagen Germany respectively. Statistical analysis of quantitative real time PCR measurements was done using the Relative Expression Software Tool V2.0.7 REST 2008 Pfaffl M. W. et al. 2002 30 e36 .

Differences between groups were tested with one way analysis of variance ANOVA followed by unpaired t tests. All data are given as means s.e.m. Significance levels of unpaired t tests are given as follows P

TBA83 mice had the highest level followed by TBA88 TBA86 and lastly TBA82. Therefore the TBA83 line was chosen for further breeding .

The TBA83 transgenic mice revealed obvious macroscopic abnormalities including growth retardation and a striking neurological phenotype characterized by loss of motor coordination data not shown . The neurological phenotype of the TBA83 line resembles that of mouse models with neurodegeneration for example Burright E. N. 1995 82 937 948 .

Mice were anaesthetized and transcardially perfused with ice cold phosphate buffered saline PBS followed by 4 paraformaldehyde. Brain samples were carefully dissected and post fixed in 4 phosphate buffered formalin at 4 C. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 4 m paraffin sections. The following antibodies were used 4G8 A 17 24 Covance Cat. No SIG 39200 GFAP Chemicon Cat. No MAB360 Iba 1 Wako Chemicals USA Cat. No 019 19741 AT8 Innogenetics Belgium Cat. No 90206 . Biotinylated secondary anti rabbit and anti mouse antibodies 1 200 were purchased from Dako. Staining was visualized using the ABC method with a Vectastain Elite ABC kit Vector Laboratories USA Cat. No PK 6200 and diaminobenzidine as chromogen. Counterstaining was carried out with hematoxylin.

The Bielschowsky staining method was performed according to the Yamamoto and Hirano 1998 1986 12 3 9 modification.

TBA83 brain sections showed strong immunoreactivity using antibody 4G8 against A predominantly in CA1 and cortical pyramidal neurons motor neurons in spinal cord pons and subcortical nuclei . Diffuse plaques were observed in the olfactory bulb but were less prominent compared to intraneuronal staining. The observation of extracellular plaques demonstrates that A is secreted. While no staining was obtained using an antibody against phosphorylated Tau AT8 not shown pretangle like structures were demonstrated in CA1 by Bielschowski silver staining . Early inflammatory reactive microglia and astroglia demonstrate hippocampal neurodegeneration .

In accordance with these findings the inventors have previously shown that intraneuronal A accumulation precedes plaque formation in transgenic mice expressing mutant APP695 with the Swedish Dutch and London mutations in combination with mutant PS 1 M146L. These mice displayed abundant intraneuronal A immunoreactivity in hippocampal and cortical pyramidal neurons. In young mice a strong intraneuronal A staining was detected in vesicular structures in somatodendritic and axonal compartments of pyramidal neurons and an attenuated neuronal immunoreactivity with increasing age. The intraneuronal immunoreactivity declined with increased plaque accumulation a finding that was also reported in Down s syndrome patients where the youngest patients displayed the strongest immunoreactivity Mori C. et al. 2002 9 88 102. . The neuronal loss in CA1 of the hippocampus did not correlate with the amount of extracellular A Breyhan H. et al. 2009 117 677 685 . The same observation has been reported in the APP PS1M146L model Schmitz C. et al. 2004 164 1495 1502 . Hippocampal neuron loss has also been reported in the APP23 mouse model however whether intraneuronal A contributes to the neuron loss in this model is not clear. The triple transgenic mouse model expresses mutant APP in combination with mutant PS 1 and mutant Tau protein. These mice displayed early synaptic dysfunction before plaque or tangle deposition was evident together with early intraneuronal A immunoreactivity preceding plaque deposition. Tau and A immunoreactivity co localized in hippocampal neurons which might imply that early intraneuronal A accumulation could affect Tau pathology.

In conclusion the TBA8 model represents a mouse model for the common sporadic form of AD as the neurological phenotype is due to wild type A peptide aggregation. TBA8 mice harbour no mutation in the coding region of A but start with a naturally occurring N terminal truncation of the first three amino acids of A . Since it is known that models based on autosomal dominant mutations in APP and the presenilin genes represent only models for the rare familial AD forms the TBA8 mice having no mutation represent a model for the common sporadic form of AD.
