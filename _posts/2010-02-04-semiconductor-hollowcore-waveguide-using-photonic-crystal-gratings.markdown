These and other aspects of the embodiments herein will be better appreciated and understood when considered in conjunction with the following description and the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the following descriptions while indicating preferred embodiments and numerous specific details thereof are given by way of illustration and not of limitation. Many changes and modifications may be made within the scope of the embodiments herein without departing from the spirit thereof and the embodiments herein include all such modifications.

The embodiments herein and the various features and advantageous details thereof are explained more fully with reference to the non limiting embodiments that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings and detailed in the following description. Descriptions of well known components and processing techniques are omitted so as to not unnecessarily obscure the embodiments herein. The examples used herein are intended merely to facilitate an understanding of ways in which the embodiments herein may be practiced and to further enable those of skill in the art to practice the embodiments herein. Accordingly the examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the embodiments herein.

The embodiments herein provide a method of fabricating a hollow core waveguide HW using high contrast gratings or photonic crystal. Referring now to the drawings and more particularly to were similar reference characters denote corresponding features consistently throughout the figures there are shown preferred embodiments.

initially a layered semiconductor based material is selected. Different types of layered semiconductor based materials can be used in accordance with the embodiments herein. An example of a first type of layered structure includes a silicon on insulator SOI wafer comprising two layers on top of a semiconductor substrate as shown in . The semiconductor substrate may comprise silicon Si or indium phosphide InP . The top layer comprises a thickness equal to the total height of the waveguide. The top layer may comprise material that is substantially similar in material composition as the substrate . The top layer comprises various regions including a bottom cladding layer a middle core layer having a thickness D and a top cladding layer having a thickness t. The second layer is a sacrificial layer having a thickness larger than half of the wavelength of the operating wave of the waveguide. The second layer may comprise silicon dioxide SiO or indium gallium arsenide InGaAs for example. The material used in the second layer can be selectively etched by a liquid or gas etcher without etching the top layer . Preferably layers have a similar index of refraction.

Alternatively an example of a second type of layered structure is shown in and comprises layers on top of a semiconductor silicon substrate . The top layer may comprise Si and has a thickness substantially equal to the thickness of the top HCG cladding material . The second layer which may comprise SiO is a sacrificial layer having a thickness near the dimension of what will become the hollow core of comparable to thickness D of middle layer of the waveguide. The third layer has a thickness near the thickness of the bottom HCG cladding material . The material composition of the third layer can be substantially similar then that of the top layer . The material used in the third layer preferably cannot be etched by a liquid or gas etcher used to etch the second layer . Preferably layers have a similar index of refraction. The fourth layer is a sacrificial layer having a thickness larger than half of the wavelength of operating wave of the waveguide. The material composition of the fourth layer can be substantially similar to that of the second layer . The material used in the fourth layer can be selectively etched by a liquid or gas etcher without etching the top layer and the third layer . An example of such a material is an epitaxially grown InP InGaAs InP InGaAs InP substrate or commercial dual SOI wafer with Si SiO Si SiO Si substrate. Another alternative is to have the fourth layer to be the substrate where an example of such a layered structure is InGaAs InP InGaAs InP substrate.

Next an etching mask pattern is performed. To fabricate the square shape HW HCG as shown in using this method one may design an etching mask pattern as shown in the top surface view of where the center portion is configured for the HW HCG. Wg is preferably configured to be close to the width of the core t is preferably configured to be close to the thickness of the grating s high index beams and d is preferred to be about three times the length of t . L is the length of supporting beam which is larger then half of the wavelength. The repeat pitch a is preferably the same as the grating period.

With reference to the etching mask may be created by e beam lithography. Examples of three methods to create the etch mask depending on the material used and etch techniques used are as follows. First direct e beam writing to create the e beam resist mask by lithography may be used. Second a mask transfer material layer may be deposited in order to perform e beam lithography with the e beam resist mask on top and etching the mask transfer material to transfer the mask . Third nano imprint technology may be used to create the etching mask .

Next a second deep trench dry etching and width opening process occurs. For the first type of layered structure i.e. the embodiment of a polymer passivation process occurs by depositing a polymer layer using well known plasma etch deposition techniques for example for Si CF Hgas can be used for the plasma deposition which will turn to CHF or depositing a SiOcoating by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition PECVD . Then a high energy low pressure plasma etching process is used to vertically etch through the bottom of the deposited material as shown in for example for Si use Ar or SF Ar .

Through the opening made in the previous step a semi isotropical etch process occurs such that more etching occurs vertically downward. Then the structure is opened laterally to form what will become the hollow core of the waveguide until the opening reaches the bottom of the designed core as shown in . Here the lateral etch is controlled very precisely such that it occurs to just undercut the core area under the top grading beam but not cut through the vertical grating beams lateral etch depth is approximately t as shown in . This step can be achieved by different etching methods including 1 modifying the process of the previously used dry etch in last step such as reducing energy radio frequency RF power increasing gas pressure and or changing gas composition or 2 a combined dry and wet chemical etch or 3 a cycled etching process of semi isotropic etching passivation vertical etching.

For the second type of layered structure i.e. the embodiment of the etching process is similar to that described above however since the core layer material is different than the top layer a selective dry etch recipe can be used to etch the core layer without the first polymer or SiOpassivation coating process. The cycled etching process may still needed to do the deep trench etch. The width opening of the trench can be performed by a wet chemical etch.

Next a third etching step occurs to etch through to the bottom grating material layer . Here a polymer passivation occurs by depositing a polymer coating using well known plasma etch deposition techniques for example for Si CF Hgas can be used for the plasma deposition which will turn to CHF or depositing a SiOcoating by PECVD. Then a high energy low pressure plasma etching process occurs to vertically etch through to the bottom of the deposited material for example for Si use Ar or SF Ar . Through the opening made in the previous step the bottom cladding grating material is etched vertically as shown in . In one embodiment the first second and third etching steps may be performed in one sequence of cycled selective directional dry etching in a same plasma etching chamber not shown .

Thereafter a fourth etching step occurs e.g. a selective wet chemical etching process to remove the sacrificial layer under the waveguide as shown in . The final 3D HW HCG structure is shown in with a single waveguide shown in having an air core therein. In one example for SOI material the sacrificial layer comprises SiO and one can use a buffered hydrofluoric acid HF oxide etch to remove SiOwithout etching the Si material .

Compared with conventional on chip waveguide devices the device provided by the embodiments herein produces ultra low waveguide losses. Also compared with conventional fabrication processes for nano scale three dimensional 3D semiconductor devices such as a 3D photonic crystal waveguide which often involve having multiple e beam lithography and photolithography processes with alignments wafer bonding with alignment crystal re growth steps and numerous separate etching steps the low cost and practical manufacturing techniques provided by the embodiments herein only require one lithography level by ether direct e beam or imprint etc. and only one cycled selective directional dry etching and only one wet chemical selective etch without any alignment re growth wafer bonding etc.

The embodiments herein may be used for making 3D photonic crystal devices and integrated optoelectronic and photonic circuits. Generally the embodiments herein provide techniques for performing a high aspect ratio deep trench etching of a semiconductor with a sub micrometer mask opening and controlled variable trench width. Furthermore the embodiments herein allow for the processing of a nano scale 3D periodic structure from a two dimensional 2D top surface with one lithography level and a controlled cycled selective directional etching process.

The foregoing description of the specific embodiments will so fully reveal the general nature of the embodiments herein that others can by applying current knowledge readily modify and or adapt for various applications such specific embodiments without departing from the generic concept and therefore such adaptations and modifications should and are intended to be comprehended within the meaning and range of equivalents of the disclosed embodiments. It is to be understood that the phraseology or terminology employed herein is for the purpose of description and not of limitation. Therefore while the embodiments herein have been described in terms of preferred embodiments those skilled in the art will recognize that the embodiments herein can be practiced with modification within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.
