As used herein the terms user equipment and UE may in some cases generally refer to mobile devices such as mobile telephones mobile devices personal digital assistants handheld laptop computers tablet computers and similar devices that have telecommunications capabilities. Such a UE may comprise a UE and its associated removable memory module such as but not limited to a Universal Integrated Circuit Card UICC that includes a Subscriber Identity Module SIM application a Universal Subscriber Identity Module USIM application or a Removable User Identity Module R UIM application. Alternatively such a UE may comprise the device itself without such a module. In other cases the term UE may refer to devices that have similar capabilities but that are not transportable such as desktop computers set top boxes or network appliances. The term UE can also refer to any hardware or software component that can terminate a communications session for a user. Also the terms user equipment UE user agent UA user device and user node might be used interchangeably herein.

It should be understood at the outset that although illustrative implementations of one or more embodiments of the present disclosure are provided below the disclosed systems and methods may be implemented using any number of techniques whether currently known or in existence. The disclosure should in no way be limited to the illustrative implementations drawings and techniques illustrated below including the example designs and implementations illustrated and described herein but may be modified within the scope of the appended claims along with their full scope of equivalents.

A successful provisioning of new applications application updates or both to existing applications on a UE e.g. mobile device may be based on for example but not limited to the UE s capability and configuration information. The UE s capability and configuration information may include the version of a firmware or system software e.g. operating system on the UE available application programming interfaces APIs or libraries on the UE or both. Additionally or alternatively the UE s capability and configuration information may include the UE s hardware and hardware configuration for example the amount of available random access memory RAM security authorizations on the UE or both. Typically the provisioning of new applications or application updates may be managed or handled by a provisioning server in communications with the UE. The term application is used further herein to describe a new e.g. downloaded application or an application update for the UE or both applications and updates. Specifically provisioning application s on the UE may refer to provisioning new application s or updates to existing application s on the UE such as software programs drivers or services.

Disclosed herein are methods devices and systems for allowing a UE to manage and handle the provisioning of applications and communicate with a provisioning server. The UE may comprise an Application and Capability Discovery Agent ACDA that may be configured to monitor and report the UE s capability and configuration information to one or a plurality of provisioning servers such as for different services. The ACDA may be a software agent or instruction code executed by a processor to implement the various provisioning schemes described below. The ACDA may maintain the capability and configuration information on the UE and report any changes in the maintained information to the communication server s . The ACDA is also referred to herein as an Application Service or both Application and Service NS Discovery Agent. The capability and configuration information may be associated with different software aspects hardware aspects or both software and hardware aspects of the UE. For example the capability and configuration information may comprise any combination of the UE s operating system OS version device drivers details about the hardware components device communications other capabilities device access plan available device services provided by a carrier current applications or other device information.

The ACDA may collect the capability and configuration information in a plurality of reports for example Service Class Maps and send the reports or descriptors to the provisioning server s . The capability and configuration information may be stored in a management object such as in an OMA DM Open Mobile Alliance Device Management object embedded in a tree structure stored on the UE or on one or more servers. The provisioning server s may then analyze the information in the reports to select or provision new applications application updates or both to existing applications for the UE such as prior to downloading an application or application update to the UE. The provisioning server s may also maintain a database about the UE s capability and configuration information. Using the ACDA on the UE to handle at least some of the provisioning of applications may provide the provisioning servers with more capability and configuration information about the UE. Further the provided information may be more regularly updated and shared between multiple provisioning servers. As such the provisioning servers may have improved capability and configuration information to provision applications for the UE before actually downloading the provisioned application for the UE which may be more efficient and reduce or prevent application failures on the UE.

As used herein the term access device generally refers to any component of the wireless network such as a traditional base station a wireless access point or an LTE or LTE A node B or eNB that creates a geographical area of reception and transmission coverage allowing a UE or a relay node not shown to access or communicate with other components in a telecommunications system such as a second UE . In this document the term access node and access device may be used interchangeably but it is understood that an access node may comprise a plurality of hardware and software components.

The access device may communicate with any UE within the same cell directly via a direct link such as in a UTRAN. The cell may be a geographical area of reception and transmission coverage. For instance the direct link may be a point to point link established between the access device and the UE and used to transmit and receive signals between the two. Alternatively the access devices may communicate with any UE in the same cell over shared links such as in an E UTRAN. For instance the shared links may comprise an uplink shared channel and a downlink shared channel. Additionally the access device s may communicate with other components or devices to provide for the components of the RAN access to any other network for instance using similar or different network protocols or technologies. In an embodiment the UEs may move about between different cells and their communications may be handed over between the different cells where the UEs may communicate with different access devices .

The access device may also allow the UEs to communicate with at least one provisioning server which may be located at or coupled to the network . The network may comprise a wireless network a wired network or a combination of any wired or wireless networks. The networks may include any combination of a Wireless LAN WLAN network an Ethernet based network an Internet Protocol IP based network a Digital Subscriber Line DSL network an Optical communications network or any other wireless or wired networks that may be used to exchange communications data with the UE .

The provisioning server s may comprise any component s system s or device s configured to select and provide application to the UE . Some of the application servers may also provision or select available or supported services for the UE such as email or data services. For instance the provisioning server may comprise an authority server that manages at least some of the communications of the UE such as a Blackberry Enterprise Server BES or other systems that promote applications or services access. Other provisioning servers may include an operation management and administration OMA device management server which may be owned by a carrier any server owned by a third party application provider such as a mobile game vendor or both. The provisioning server may provision or select the application for the UE based on the capabilities and configurations of the UE that are associated with the UE s software elements hardware elements or both.

Specifically the provisioning of application may be based on the capabilities and configurations that are monitored and reported to the provisioning server s by the UE . The UE may comprise an ACDA that is configured to monitor and report the UE s configuration and capability information to the provisioning server s . The ACDA may comprise a software agent that may run on the UE to obtain the configuration and capability information which may be associated with different software elements hardware elements or both software and hardware element of the UE . In some embodiments the ACDA may maintain the capability and configuration information on the UE for example in one or a plurality of reports files tables lists databases or combinations thereof. For instance the ACDA may monitor the UE and update the maintained capability and configuration information on the UE upon detecting any changes in the UE s hardware software or both.

The configuration and capability information may comprise the UE s operating system OS version firmware information such as device drivers hardware details or both. The hardware details may comprise the UE s available communications transport technologies e.g. 3G EDGE General Packet Radio Service GPRS WiFi WiMAX tethered Universal Serial Bus USB or other technologies . The configuration and capability information may also comprise the UE s available services that are provided by a carrier such as support for new protocols e.g. session initiation protocol SIP extensions to existing services such as larger email mailbox or larger email attachments or both. The configuration and capability information may also comprise any installed software which may include libraries applications a change to the user s billing plan such as free unlimited data access for evenings and weekends a change to the user s access rights such as a BES policy change to allow the user to access social networking sites out of work hours or combinations thereof. Additionally or alternatively the configuration and capability information may comprise any other information that may be related to the loading or operating of new software on the UE .

In an embodiment the ACDA may obtain or update the current configuration and capability information on the UE for instance as scheduled or indicated by the user of the UE any of the provisioning servers or an operator of the RAN . The ACDA at the UE may format or combine the configuration and capability information into a plurality of reports that may be associated with the different provisioning servers . For instance the reports may comprise a plurality of Service Class Maps for different provisioning servers or different applications services or classes. In some embodiments the reports may comprise a plurality of standardized file types such as Extensible Markup Language XML documents. The reports may be forwarded to the corresponding provisioning servers for example as scheduled upon detecting a change or update in the capability and configuration information or upon a request from the user of the UE or any of the provisioning servers .

For example upon downloading or updating an application on the UE the ACDA may detect the changes to the capability and configuration information such as new application or update update the reports such as Service Class Maps accordingly and send the reports to the provisioning servers . The ACDA may send the updated report s to one or more provisioning servers or in some cases to a specific provisioning server associated with the application on the UE . In another example a provisioning server may request the maintained report s or new reports from the UE before deciding whether to provision or select an application for the UE which may become available at the provisioning server . Thus the UE may send the report s to the requesting provisioning server or to all the provisioning servers . In yet another example the report s may be sent to the provisioning server s upon detecting a request from the user of the UE to download a new application or application update on the UE and before beginning downloading.

The provisioning servers may process the reports from the ACDA to provide or select the application for the UE . For instance a provisioning server may process a received new report from the ACDA that indicates updated or changed capability and configuration information for the UE . Thus the provisioning server may provision or select an application for the UE which may not have been previously selected for the UE before the changes in the capabilities and configurations of the UE . The provisioning server may select the application for the UE from a list of available applications available at the provisioning server . For example an addition to the service rights for the UE may be indicated in the report and accordingly the provisioning server may select a previously unprovisioned service for the UE due to the addition of the new service rights for the UE . In some cases the provisioning server may unselect or unprovision an application of the UE based on the changes in the UE s capabilities and configurations indicated in the received new report. For example a loss of service rights for the UE may be indicated in the report and accordingly the provisioning server may unselect a previously provisioned application update for the UE due to the loss of service rights for the UE .

Generating the updated reports at the ACDA may provide current and regularly updated UE capability and configuration information which may improve the provisioning of applications and reduce the risk of misprovisioning and thus prevent application failures on the UE . Specifically the provisioning servers may provision or unprovision applications application updates services or combinations thereof for the UE based on the updated reports from the ACDA before allowing the UE to download an application or an application update.

In an embodiment the provisioning servers may maintain a plurality of corresponding lists or a shared list of capability and configuration information for example in a plurality of databases or a shared database for each UE or for a large number of UEs. The provisioning servers may maintain in the list s the updated capability and configuration information of the UE which may be received in the reports from the ACDA. For instance when a new report is received the provisioning servers may update the information in the list and may use the updated information to provision at least one of new applications application updates or services or to unprovision at least one of previously selected applications updates or services for the UE . Alternatively when a request for an application is received from the UE the provisioning servers may analyze the list which may comprise the last updated capability and configuration information received in the last report to determine whether the requested application or update may be provisioned or granted for the UE .

In an embodiment if an application becomes supported by the UE a provisioning server may perform an unsolicited push of the application to the UE . Pushing an unsolicited application on the UE may be more appropriate if the changes to the UE enable a new version or update to an existing application on the UE rather than pushing a completely new application to the UE without the user s knowledge or consent. In one scenario the provisioning server may update a list of provisioned services applications for the UE or a plurality of UEs based on their reported capability and configuration information and subsequently push the list to the UE or the UEs to inform the UE s about the provisioned services applications or offer to download them.

In another embodiment if an application becomes supported by the UE for example based on the UE s last reported capability and configuration information the provisioning server may announce to the user the availability of the new application for instance via a prompt in a browser e.g. using a pop up window or some other notification e.g. email . Thus the user may have a choice to download or ignore the new application. Further in some embodiments the ACDA may register or update the capability and configuration information on the UE such as in a Service Class Map or XML document and retain this information on the UE . Subsequently if the user wishes to download a new application or update an existing application the Service Class Map or XML document may be sent to the provisioning server to determine whether the UE may support or run the new application or the update.

In an embodiment the provisioning server may place the UE s identity UE ID on a list of UEs for future solicitation that may be related to the supported application such as a new marketing campaign for the latest upgrade or release of a new mobile game. In one scenario a plurality of network providers such as service or application providers may consult any of the provisioning servers to determine whether any new UEs were provisioned based on their reported capability and configuration information for services applications offered by the network providers. For instance the network providers may search for UEs in a list associated with the services applications offered by the network providers which may be maintained by a provisioning server . The network providers may then push a solicitation for example in an email to the UEs in the list to inform the UEs about their service applications or offer to download them. Alternatively the network providers may search the list for any newly added UEs that were not previously on the list and push a solicitation to the new UEs on the list.

Since the Service Class Maps are created by the ACDA at the UE the provisioning of the application is supported and initially handled at the UE . The offloading of at least a portion of the provisioning functions from the provisioning servers to the UE may improve applications and device capability provisioning in the RAN . Specifically using the ACDA to monitor and report the UE s capability and configuration information and to communicate with the provisioning servers prior to allowing the download of an application or application update to the UE may prevent the erroneous installation of software on the UE and the subsequent failure of misprovisioned applications to operate on the UE which will improve user experience and provide other benefits. Maintaining the capability and configuration information of the UE in a shared list or database between the provisioning servers may also prevent the provisioning of applications services or updates that may conflict with other applications services or updates from the different provisioning servers.

The first provisioning server may comprise an OMA device management server that comprises a second A S Discovery Agent and an OMA device manager . The second A S Discovery Agent may communicate with the first A S Discovery Agent using the application service and capability discovery protocol and receive the report from the first A S Discovery Agent . The received report for the UE may be maintained in the first provisioning server for example in a database. The OMA device manager may analyze or process the information in the report or the maintained information of the UE in the database and accordingly provision or select application for the UE . For example the provisioned applications updates may be added to a provision list of applications services or both applications and services associated with or available to the UE .

The second provisioning server may comprise a third A S Discovery Agent and a set of deployed service discovery systems for example on a home enterprise network. The third A S Discovery Agent may receive the report from the first A S Discovery Agent using the application service and capability discovery protocol. The set of deployed service discovery systems may represent different connectivity technologies for example with external networks. The set of deployed service discovery systems may analyze or process the reported UE s capability configuration information and accordingly provision a plurality of services for the UE which may be deployed at the home enterprise network. The set of deployed service discovery systems may comprise Service discovery protocols SDPs such as Bonjour Service Universal Plug and Play UPNP Service Location Protocol SLP other service discovery protocols or combinations thereof. The set of deployed service discovery systems may select the services e.g. Service Service Service that may be supported by the UE based on the capability configuration information sent by the A S Discovery Agent . Similar to the first provisioning server the second provisioning server may maintain the capability configuration information for each UE and maintain a list of any combination of provisioned applications application updates or services for each UE .

At step the ACDA may combine the capability and configuration information in one or a plurality of reports. For instance the ACDA may combine the information about at least one of the applications or services available at the UE and the UE s device capabilities in a plurality of Service Class Maps or AML documents that may correspond to a plurality of service classes or provisioning servers . The ACDA may format the information about the application services or both and device capabilities into a report file format according to an application service and capability discovery protocol that may be used at the provisioning servers . At step the ACDA may send the report s to one or a plurality of provisioning servers. For instance the ACDA may send the Service Class Maps to the corresponding provisioning servers e.g. the first provisioning server and the second provisioning server . The ACDA may use the application service and capability discovery protocol to communicate the Service Class Maps to the provisioning servers. The provisioning servers may also use the application service and capability discovery protocol to analyze or process the information about the applications services device capabilities or combinations thereof in the received Service Class Maps.
