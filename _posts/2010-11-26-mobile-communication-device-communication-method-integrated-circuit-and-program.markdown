The present invention relates to a mobile communication device that includes a reader writer of proximity wireless communication and a general purpose communication means.

The present invention also relates to a mobile communication device that includes a reader writer of proximity wireless communication and a general purpose communication means and facilitates setting in a home network.

High expectations are placed on a Home Energy Management System HEMS that networks and automatically controls energy consuming appliances in a home such as home appliances and water heaters. Moreover as studies for home appliance traceability daily life watching services and the like have started a home network including white goods is expected to come into widespread use. However it is extremely difficult to perform initial setting of a network on white goods having no display device and input device. This difficulty in performing setting necessary for various services hampers the widespread use of the home network.

Meanwhile proximity wireless communication is widely employed in devices such as mobile phones and technological development for facilitating mail address forwarding and the like is underway.

PTL 1 discloses a method of facilitating input for setting access to a content server through the use of the proximity wireless communication technology. The method disclosed in PTL 1 is a method system that saves the user from having to input a URL of a content server to be accessed by a mobile phone by transferring a unique number of a terminal and a URL of a redirect server to the mobile phone by proximity wireless communication.

PTL 2 discloses a method whereby information of a cargo is received from a proximity wireless device attached to the cargo and at the same time geographical position information is received from Global Positioning System GPS to automatically communicate the geographical position information of the cargo to a server. This method system saves the user from having to input these information.

For automation of home network setting proximity wireless communication may be effectively used to facilitate setting.

However it is insufficient to simply transfer information of an appliance to a server by proximity wireless communication. This is because network setting on a home by home basis cannot be made when the user simply transfers only information of a terminal to the server.

Moreover to realize advanced services of the HEMS it is essential to set relative positions of home appliances in each home. The conventional techniques however have a problem of being unable to precisely recognize positions of all home appliances in each home.

Though setting in a home network is likely to become easier if position information of each home appliance can be obtained adding a position information obtainment function such as GPS to an ordinary home appliance is very costly. Thus it is likely to be difficult to provide the position information obtainment function to an appliance apparatus device other than a device such as a mobile phone or a digital camera whose application requires the position information obtainment function.

The user on the other hand demands a communication device capable of completing setting necessary for a home network without a complex operation.

The present invention has an object of providing a mobile communication device that can facilitate setting in a home network.

The present invention also has an object of providing a device that enables by a simple operation transmission of predetermined transmission information to a predetermined server when an appliance such as a home appliance is installed in a home see a home in .

The present invention also has an object of providing a device that can as a result of the above simple operation simplify an operation when a wireless LAN access point see an access point in or the like performs suitable wireless communication corresponding to an installation position from among first wireless communication in a first mode e.g. wireless communication with relatively low power and second wireless communication in a second mode wireless communication with relatively high power .

To solve the problems stated above the present invention is a mobile communication device including an appliance information obtainment unit that obtains from an appliance installed at a predetermined position e.g. inside a home appliance information by proximity wireless communication between the installed appliance and the mobile communication device the appliance information specifying the appliance from among a plurality of appliances a position information obtainment unit that obtains position information indicating a position of the mobile communication device when the proximity wireless communication is performed between the installed appliance and the mobile communication device and a transmission unit that transmits transmission information to a predetermined server in the case where the proximity wireless communication is performed the transmission information including the appliance information obtained by the proximity wireless communication and the obtained position information.

For example when the proximity wireless communication is performed means that the proximity wireless communication is performed where the installation position of the appliance apparatus device is the same position as the position of the mobile communication device.

Here the same position includes an instance where the installation position of the appliance can be regarded as the same position as the position of the mobile communication device.

Note that the proximity wireless communication mentioned above is for example communication according to Near Field Communication NFC when a touching operation of a card for electronic money is performed upon electronic money payment and the like.

For instance NFC is performed within a distance of several centimeters e.g. within 2 centimeters or 3 centimeters upon a touching operation.

Hence the same position mentioned above means for example that the installation position of the appliance is within several centimeters from the position of the mobile communication device.

A communication device according to the present invention is for example a mobile communication device that reads terminal device information from a terminal device apparatus appliance by proximity wireless communication and transmits the terminal device information to a server via a general purpose network the mobile communication device including a terminal device information obtainment unit that obtains the terminal device information from the terminal device by the proximity wireless communication the terminal device information including at least terminal device identification information for identifying manufacturing information of the terminal device a communication device information storage unit that stores communication device information including at least communication device identification information for identifying manufacturing information of the communication device an information adding unit that adds the stored communication device information to the obtained terminal device information to generate transmission information to be transmitted to the server and a communication unit that transmits the generated transmission information to the server via the general purpose network wherein the communication unit specifies the server based on the terminal device information obtained from the terminal device and communicates with the specified server.

Moreover the mobile communication device may include a proximity wireless communication device and a wired wireless communication device constituting a home network wherein a home ID for uniquely identifying a home is added to the terminal device information received by the proximity wireless communication device and the terminal device information to which the home ID is added is transmitted to the server using the home network communication device. Furthermore given that two home appliances are adjacent to each other during the proximity wireless communication position information immediately after the proximity wireless communication is performed with a device such as a mobile phone provided with a GPS device or an acceleration sensor may be transmitted to the server as position information of a corresponding home appliance.

The mobile communication device according to the present invention enables the user to complete setting necessary for a home network without a complex operation.

The transmission information can be transmitted by a simple operation such as merely touching the mobile communication device to the installed appliance.

The device used here is a mobile communication device such as a mobile phone with there being no need to add a new structure for proximity wireless communication. This contributes to a lower cost.

In addition the device used here is a mobile communication device with there being no need to add a new structure for obtainment of position information. This contributes to a sufficiently lower cost. That is an extent of cost reduction can be increased.

A very complex operation required to perform suitable wireless communication such as an operation of wireless communication power setting becomes unnecessary as a simple operation such as a touching operation is sufficient. Thus a significantly simplified operation can be realized.

The mobile communication device may include an appliance information obtainment unit an appliance information obtainment unit that obtains from an appliance e.g. an appliance in such as a TV NA in installed at a predetermined position e.g. the home inside the home in appliance information appliance information by proximity wireless communication proximity wireless communication communication according to NFC between the installed appliance and the mobile communication device e.g. a mobile communication device the appliance information specifying the appliance the first appliance from among a plurality of appliances e.g. the first appliance and a second appliance in a position information obtainment unit a position information obtainment unit that obtains position information position information indicating a position a position of the appliance a position of the TV NA of the mobile communication device when the proximity wireless communication is performed between the installed appliance and the mobile communication device as a result of for example a movement of the mobile communication device to touch the appliance i.e. the proximity wireless communication is performed where the position of the installed appliance the appliance the TV NA is the same position as the position of the mobile communication device and a transmission unit a transmission unit that transmits transmission information transmission information to a predetermined server a server e.g. a server of a manufacturer of the appliance situated outside the home and connected to a communication line in in the case where the proximity wireless communication is performed the transmission information including the appliance information the appliance information obtained by the proximity wireless communication and the obtained position information the position information at the same position the position of the TV NA .

Moreover the mobile communication device may further include a detection unit a communication detection unit in that detects that the proximity wireless communication the proximity wireless communication is performed between the installed appliance and the mobile communication device upon a touching operation or the like the proximity wireless communication being performed in the case where the appliance the appliance is installed at the predetermined position the home wherein the transmission unit transmits the transmission information the transmission information to the predetermined server in the case where the detection unit detects that the proximity wireless communication is performed the transmission information being required to be transmitted to e.g. registered in the server in the case where the appliance is installed at the predetermined position the transmitted transmission information includes the appliance information the appliance information specifying the installed appliance from among the plurality of appliances the appliance information obtainment unit obtains the appliance information from the appliance by the proximity wireless communication the transmitted transmission information includes position information the position information indicating the position at which the appliance is installed and the position information obtainment unit obtains as the position information indicating the position of the appliance the position information the position information indicating the position of the mobile communication device the mobile communication device when the proximity wireless communication is performed between the installed appliance and the mobile communication device.

According to this structure the transmission information including the appliance information and the position information which needs to be transmitted to the server e.g. the server of the manufacturer of the appliance in the case where the appliance is installed in the home can be transmitted by a simple operation such as a touching operation to initiate the proximity wireless communication .

Besides the device that performs the proximity wireless communication is the mobile communication device such as a mobile phone with there being no need to add a new structure to perform the proximity wireless communication . This contributes to a lower cost.

In addition the device is the mobile communication device with there being no need to add a new structure to obtain the position information. This contributes to a sufficiently lower cost. That is an extent of cost reduction can be increased.

Note that for instance the appliance the appliance is a home appliance e.g. the TV NA or a FF heater NK in in the home the home and the mobile communication device is a mobile phone of a resident of the home in which the appliance is installed a smartphone of the resident with a mobile phone function or the like.

Moreover the obtained position information the position information may specify a movement a movement in of the mobile communication device from a base point a base point in the access point in to the position at which the appliance e.g. a first appliance a second appliance the FF heater NK the TV NA in is installed to indicate a first position a first position P in the position of the FF heater NK in in the case where the specified movement the movement is a first movement to the first position and a second position a second position P the position of the TV NA in the case where the specified movement is a second movement to the second position the second position P wherein the server the server in e.g. a server home server in to which the transmission information is transmitted performs control so that wireless communication in a first mode low power wireless communication is performed between a predetermined wireless communication device a processor the access point in and the installed appliance in the case where the movement the movement specified by the position information in the transmission information is the first movement and wireless communication in a second mode high power wireless communication is performed between the predetermined wireless communication device and the installed appliance in the case where the specified movement is the second movement.

Thus wireless communication in a suitable mode the wireless communication corresponding to the position the first position P the second position P at which the appliance is installed in the home may be performed by transmitting the transmission information as described above.

According to this structure a very complex operation required to perform suitable wireless communication such as an operation of wireless communication power setting becomes unnecessary as a simple operation such as a touching operation of the mobile communication device is sufficient. Thus a significantly simplified operation can be realized.

Moreover the position information obtainment unit may include an acceleration sensor an acceleration sensor in that detects an acceleration when the mobile communication device moves the movement in to the position at which the appliance is installed from the base point the base point in the access point in FIG. wherein the obtained position information the position information specifies the movement the movement according to the detected acceleration to indicate the position the position of the appliance e.g. the first appliance in of the mobile communication device after the specified movement the movement as the position at which the appliance is installed.

According to this structure for example even in the case where a GPS field intensity is not adequate to obtain position information of sufficiently high accuracy appropriate position information can be obtained merely by using the acceleration sensor. This ensures appropriate processing.

Moreover the predetermined position at which the appliance is installed is inside a home wherein the proximity wireless communication the proximity wireless communication in is communication according to Near Field Communication NFC performed when in the case where the appliance is installed in the home a user of the mobile communication device in the home in which the appliance is installed performs an operation in of touching the mobile communication device to the installed appliance.

The mobile communication device may also be implemented for example as described in Other Variations or in Embodiments A and B. The description of Other Variations appears at the end of this section i.e. Description of Embodiments and should be referenced when necessary.

The technical field of Embodiments A A1 to A13 and B B1 to B7 described below is a relatively new field with various possibilities where it is relatively difficult to predict what kinds of technologies will be widely available in the future.

In view of this the following describes a relatively wide variety of technologies e.g. Embodiments A1 to A13 B1 to B7 .

See for example for Embodiment A1 for Embodiment A2 for Embodiment A3 for Embodiment A4 for Embodiment A5 for Embodiment A6 for Embodiment A7 for Embodiment A8 for Embodiment A9 for Embodiment A10 for Embodiment A11 for Embodiment A12 and for Embodiment A13.

See for example for Embodiment B1 for Embodiment B2 for Embodiment B3 for Embodiment B4 for Embodiment B5 for Embodiment B6 and for Embodiment B7.

Here the whole drawing including B and C e.g. each of B and C is referred to as FIG. when necessary. The same applies to and the like.

For example each apparatus device Embodiments A A1 to A13 and B B1 to B7 other variations may be implemented as follows. The components of the apparatus may typically be realized by Large Scale Integration LSI as an integrated circuit. The components may each be implemented individually as one chip or may be partly or wholly implemented on one chip. The integrated circuit may be referred to as any of IC system LSI super LSI ultra LSI or the like depending on the degree of integration. The integrated circuit according to the embodiments may be referred to as any of these terms. Moreover the integrated circuit method is not limited to LSI and may be realized by a dedicated circuit or a general purpose processor. A Field Programmable Gate Array FPGA or a reconfigurable processor capable of reconfiguring connections and settings of circuit cells in an LSI circuit may also be used.

Furthermore if an integrated circuit technology that replaces the current semiconductor technology emerges from advancement of semiconductor technologies or other derivative technologies such a technology can be used for the functional block integration. For instance biotechnology may be adapted in this way.

A communication device according to Embodiment A Embodiments A1 to A13 may be a subordinate conception of the following communication device X e.g. .

The communication device X is a communication device e.g. a mobile device N in a communication device Y in a communication device M in a communication device MS or MR in that reads terminal device information from a terminal device e.g. the TV NA in a terminal device Y in by proximity wireless communication RF tag communication and transmits the read terminal device information to a server apparatus a registration server N in a server Y in via a general purpose network a home network N or an external network N in . In detail the communication device X includes a terminal device information obtainment unit a RF ID reader writer N in a device UID obtainment unit M in that obtains the terminal device information information in a memory N in product information in a in information in a ROM Y in from the terminal device e.g. the TV NA in by the proximity wireless communication the terminal device information including at least terminal device identification information for identifying manufacturing information of the terminal device a communication device information storage unit e.g. a memory unit N in a ROM Y in that stores communication device information including at least communication device identification information information in the memory unit N in a product serial number stored in the ROM Y in for identifying manufacturing information of the communication device an information adding unit a CPU N in a registration information generation unit M in an information adding unit Y in that adds the stored communication device information to the obtained terminal device information to generate transmission information e.g. server registration information in b in to be transmitted to the server apparatus the transmission information information including both the terminal device information and the communication device information being obtained by adding the communication device information to the terminal device information and a communication unit a communication unit N in a registration information transmitting receiving unit M in a communication unit Y in that transmits the transmission information generated by the information adding unit to the server apparatus via the general purpose network. The communication unit specifies as the server to which the transmission information is to be transmitted the server e.g. the registration server N in indicated by the terminal device information based on the terminal device information e.g. address of registration server in the product information in a in obtained from the terminal device the TV NA in and communicates with the specified server.

Here the communication device X may further include a position information obtainment unit a GPS N or a 6 axis sensor N in a position information obtainment unit M in a position information determination unit Y in that obtains position information of the communication device. The position information obtainment unit may obtain the position information of the communication device at a timing when the proximity wireless communication between the terminal device e.g. the TV NA in and the communication device is established in the terminal device information obtainment unit wherein the communication device information includes the position information of the communication device obtained by the position information obtainment unit.

Moreover the communication device information may include identification information home ID of a home the home in or a person the user of the communication device .

The communication device X is a mobile terminal that is included in a HEMS a system in and carried by the user thus having the same position as the user.

Of the case where a distance between the terminal device e.g. the TV NA in and the communication device is a proximate distance less than a threshold and the case where the distance is a far distance not less than the threshold the terminal device information obtainment unit performs the proximity wireless communication with the terminal device only in the case of the proximate distance.

The communication unit causes the server apparatus to perform processing e.g. control of the terminal device for the terminal device the TV NA in with which the proximity wireless communication is performed from among a plurality of terminal devices e.g. a plurality of terminal devices in or a plurality of terminal devices including a terminal device in a home other than the home in .

According to this structure from among the terminal device e.g. the TV NA in into proximity of which the communication device is moved and other terminal devices e.g. a terminal device in another home control or the like is easily performed only for the terminal device in the proximate distance and not for the other terminal devices. Thus control or the like is performed only for an appropriate terminal device. This ensures that processing is performed only for an appropriate terminal device.

Such control or the like only for an appropriate terminal device can be achieved simply by moving the communication device into proximity of the terminal device without requiring a complex operation. Hence it is possible to easily perform appropriate processing i.e. processing only for an appropriate terminal device.

The terminal device information obtainment unit also obtains from the terminal device e.g. the TV NA in the terminal device information for specifying the server apparatus from among a plurality of server apparatuses by the proximity wireless communication.

The communication unit then causes the server apparatus specified by the terminal device information obtained by the terminal device information obtainment unit to perform the above mentioned processing such as control.

This ensures that processing by an appropriate server apparatus is performed regardless of any factor outside the terminal device the TV NA .

The communication device further includes a home ID transmission unit a home ID management unit M in that specifies the home the home in in which the communication device is used from among a plurality of homes and transmits to the server apparatus a home ID for specifying each appliance appliances in installed in the home the home in specified by the home ID from among a plurality of appliances the appliances in the home in appliances in another home to cause the server apparatus to specify that the terminal device the TV NA with which the proximity wireless communication is performed is included in the appliances installed in the home.

For example the home ID may be transmitted to the server apparatus via a predetermined communication unit e.g. the registration information transmitting receiving unit M in that transmits the home ID.

The home ID transmission unit may cause the server apparatus to specify that the terminal device the TV NA is included in the appliances installed in the home to thereby cause the server apparatus to specify a map a product map in in which the terminal device the TV NA is included in products whose positions are indicated to the user as a product map the product map in .

The home ID transmission unit may also cause the server apparatus to specify that the terminal device the TV NA is included in the appliances the appliances in to thereby cause the server apparatus to perform on the terminal device the TV NA processing e.g. processing of powering ON an appliance nearest the user to be performed for each of the appliances.

The communication device further includes the position information obtainment unit mentioned above that obtains a position of the terminal device the TV NA with which the proximity wireless communication is performed and causes the server apparatus to specify the obtained position as the position of the terminal device where the position of the terminal device is the same position as the communication device.

According to this structure merely by moving the communication device to an appropriate position the position of the TV NA it is possible to easily cause the server apparatus to perform processing in accordance with the position of the terminal device the TV NA .

The communication device Y in may be a subordinate conception a specific example of the communication device X.

Here a communication system including an image capturing device camera a communication device A a TV and a server image server is illustrated. In the image capturing device capturing images is illustrated on a left hand side while the image capturing device reproducing the captured images is illustrated on a right hand side.

The image capturing device is an example of the communication device according to the aspect of the present invention. Here the image capturing device is implemented as a digital camera.

For units used in capturing images see the left hand side in the image capturing device includes a first power supply unit a video processing unit a first antenna a first processing unit a second memory and a RF ID second antenna . The second memory holds medium identification information captured image state information and server specific information . The RF ID antenna is used for a RF ID unit.

For units used in reproducing images see the right hand side in the image capturing device includes the first power supply unit a first memory a power detection unit an activation unit the second memory a second processing unit a modulation switch unit a communication unit a second power supply unit and the RF ID antenna . The second memory holds medium identification information captured image state information and the server specific information .

The TV is an example of an apparatus device connected with a reader via a communication path. In more detail the TV is a television receiving apparatus used to display image data captured by the image capturing device . The TV includes a display unit and a RF ID reader writer .

The server is a computer that holds image data uploaded from the image capturing device to the server and that downloads the image data to the TV . The server has a storage device in which data image data is stored.

When images of objects such as scenery are captured by the image capturing device the images are converted to captured data image data by the video processing unit . Then in communicable conditions the image data is wirelessly transmitted to an access point using the first antenna for a wireless Local Area Network LAN or Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access WiMAX and eventually recorded as the data via for example the Internet to the predetermined server .

Here the first processing unit records the captured image state information regarding the captured image data onto the second memory in a RF ID unit in the image capturing device . The captured image state information recorded by the first processing unit or the like indicates at least one of a date and time of capturing each of the images b the number of the captured images c date and time of finally transmitting uploading an image d the number of transmitted uploaded images and e date and time of finally capturing an image. In addition the captured image state information includes f serial numbers of images that have already been uploaded or images that have not yet been uploaded g a serial number of a finally captured image and the like.

In addition the first processing unit generates a Uniform Resource Locator URL of the data that is uploaded to the server . The first processing unit records the server specific information URL onto the second memory . The server specific information is used to access the image data the data in . The medium identification information is also recorded on the second memory . The medium identification information is used to determine whether the device embedded with the RF ID RF ID unit is a camera a card or a post card.

When a main power the first power supply unit such as a battery of the camera the image capturing device is ON the second memory receives power from the main power. Even if the main power of the camera is OFF the external RF ID reader writer located outside supplies power to the RF ID antenna of the RF ID unit . This enables the passive second power supply unit without any power like a battery to adjust a voltage to provide power to respective units in a RF ID circuit unit including the second memory . Thereby it is possible to supply power to the second memory so that the data in the second memory is recorded reproduced and transmitted received by the image capturing device .

Here the second power supply unit is a circuit generating power from radio waves received by the second antenna . The second power supply unit includes a rectifier circuit and the like. Whenever the main power is ON or OFF the data in the second memory is read and written by the second processing unit . When the main power is ON the data in the second memory can be read and written also by the first processing unit . In other words the second memory is implemented as a nonvolatile memory and both the first processing unit and the second processing unit can read and write data from and to the second memory .

When the image capturing device completes capturing images of a trip or the like and then the captured images are to be reproduced the following processing is performed as illustrated on the right side of as being the situation of reproducing images. The image capturing device is moved into proximity of the RF ID reader writer of the TV by the user of the image capturing device or the like. Then the RF ID reader writer supplies power to the RF ID unit via the antenna . Based on the supplied power the second power supply unit provides power to the units in the RF ID unit even if the main power the first power supply unit of the image capturing device is OFF.

The captured image state information and the server specific information are read by the second processing unit from the second memory and transmitted to the TV via the antenna by the second processing unit or the like.

The TV generates a URL based on the server specific information then downloads the image data of the data from the server specified by the URL and eventually displays on the display unit thumbnails or the like of images in the image data.

If it is determined based on the captured image state information that there is any captured image not yet uploaded to the server the determination result is displayed on the display unit . If necessary the image capturing device is activated to upload to the server image data of the captured image not yet uploaded.

 a b and c in are an external front view an external back view and an external right side view respectively of the image capturing device according to the present invention.

As illustrated in c in the antenna used for a wireless LAN and the antenna used for the RF ID unit are embedded in a right side of the image capturing device . The antennas are covered with an antenna cover made of a material not shielding radio waves.

The RF ID unit operates at a frequency of 13.5 MHz while the wireless LAN operates at a frequency of 2.5 GHz. The significant difference in frequency prevents interference between them.

Therefore the two antennas and are seen overlapping with each other from the outside as illustrated in c in . The structure decreases an installation area of the antennas eventually reducing a size of the image capturing device .

The structure also enables the single antenna cover to cover both of the two antennas as illustrated in c in so that the part made of the material not shielding radio waves is minimized. The material not shielding radio waves such as plastic has a strength lower than that of a metal. Therefore the minimization of the material can reduce a decrease in a strength of a body of the image capturing device . The image capturing device further includes a lens and a power switch . The units assigned with reference signs to will be described later.

Image data captured by an image capturing unit is provided to a recording reproducing unit via the video processing unit and then recorded onto a third memory . The image data is eventually recorded onto an Integrated Circuit IC card that is removable from the image capturing device .

The above processing is instructed by the first processing unit that is for example a Central Processing Unit CPU . The image data such as captured photographs or video is provided to an encryption unit a transmission unit in a communication unit and then the first antenna in order to be transmitted to an access point or the like by radio via a wireless LAN WiMAX or the like. From the access point or the like the image data is transmitted to the server via the Internet . In the above manner the image data such as photographs is uploaded.

There is a situation where a part of the image data fails to be uploaded because for example the communication state is not good or there is no nearby access point or base station. In the situation some images have already been uploaded to the server and the other images have not yet been uploaded.

Therefore the image data in the server is different from the image data captured by the image capturing device .

In Embodiment A1 of the present invention the RF ID reader writer of the TV or the like reads the server specific information and the like from the second memory in the RF ID unit of the image capturing device . Then based on the readout information a URL or the like of the server is generated. According to the URL the TV accesses the server to access the data such as a file folder or the like uploaded by the image capturing device . Then the TV downloads the uploaded images from among the images captured by the image capturing device and displays the downloaded images. The above method will be described in more detail later.

If a part or all of the captured images is not uploaded as image data of the data in the server a problem would occur that a user downloading the images to the TV cannot watch a part of the images on the TV .

In order to solve the problem in Embodiment A1 of the present invention the first processing unit causes a recording reproducing unit to indicate information regarding a state of captured images such as information of uploading state to the captured image state information in the second memory .

In the second memory synchronization information is recorded. The synchronization information indicates whether or not image data in the server matches image data captured by the camera in other words whether or not the image data in the server is in synchronization with the image data captured by the camera.

In Embodiment A1 of the present invention the TV reads the captured image state information from the second memory via the second antenna .

The captured image state information makes it possible to instantly determine whether or not the data in the server lacks any image.

If the determination is made that there is any image that has not yet been uploaded then the determination result is displayed on the display unit of the TV . Here the TV also displays a message of Please upload images to a viewer. Or the TV issues an instruction to the camera via the RF ID antenna to transmit an activation signal to the activation unit thereby supplying power to the first power supply unit of the image capturing device . Thereby the TV causes the image capturing device to upload to the server the images in the first memory or the like of the image capturing device which have not yet been uploaded via a wireless LAN a wired LAN the RF ID antenna or the like.

Since transmission via the RF ID antenna has a small transfer amount transmission of the image data as originally captured takes a considerable time to upload and display the image data. This causes a user to feel unpleasant.

In order to avoid this according to Embodiment A1 of the present invention when the image data is transmitted via the RF ID antenna thumbnails of the images not yet uploaded are transmitted instead.

The thumbnails can shorten apparent upload time and display time suppressing unpleasant feeling of the user.

Most of current RF ID of a HF band has a transfer amount of several hundreds kbps. However development of RF ID having a quad speed has been examined. The quad speed RF ID has a possibility of achieving a transfer amount of several Mbps. If thumbnails of images not yet uploaded are transmitted it is possible to transmit several dozens of thumbnails in one second. If thumbnails are displayed in a list thumbnails of all images including images not yet uploaded can be displayed on the TV within a time period a general user can tolerate. The above is one of practical solutions.

If the image capturing device is forced to be activated to upload images not yet uploaded as described above the most speedy and stable path is selected from a wireless LAN the RF ID antenna and a wired LAN to be used for uploading and displaying on the TV.

In the situation where the image capturing device receives power from the outside via the second antenna the communication unit transmitting signals to the second antenna performs communication with the outside by a low speed modulation method. On the other hand in the situation where the image capturing device can receive power from the first power supply unit or the like the communication unit switches the modulation method to a modulation method having a large signal point such as Quadrature Phase Shift Keying QPSK 16 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation QAN or 64 QAN as needed in order to achieve high speed transfer to upload the image data not yet uploaded in a short time.

Furthermore when the power detection unit detects for example that the first power supply unit or the like does not have enough power or that the image capturing device is not connected to an external power the first power supply unit stops supplying power and the modulation switch unit switches the modulation method employed by the communication unit to a modulation method having a smaller signal point or less transfer rate. As a result it is possible to prevent that the capacity of the first power supply unit is reduced to be equal to or less than a set value.

There is another solution for power. When power is not enough the second processing unit the communication unit or the like sends a power increase request signal to the RF ID reader writer of the TV via the second antenna to request for power support. In response to the request the RF ID reader writer increases providing power to have a value greater than the set value for the power used in reading data from the RF ID unit. Since the RF ID unit receives more power via the antenna the RF ID unit can provide power to the communication unit or the first processing unit . Thereby a power amount of a battery for the first power supply unit is not reduced. Or without the battery the image capturing device can practically and unlimitedly continue transmission.

As still another method uploaded image data information in can be used. In uploaded image data information uploaded image information such as serial numbers of photographs is recorded. It is also possible to use hashed information generated by hashing the information . As a result a data amount is reduced.

The TV can read the above information to be compared to information of images captured by the camera thereby obtaining information of images not yet uploaded.

As still another method not yet uploaded image data existence identification information can be used. The not yet uploaded image data existence identification information includes an existence identifier indicating whether or not there is any image not yet uploaded. Since existence of images not yet uploaded is notified data in the second memory can be significantly reduced.

It is also possible to use not yet uploaded image number indicating the number of images not yet uploaded. Since the image capturing device allows the TV to read the information a viewer can be informed of the number of images to be uploaded. In this case a data capacity in addition to the number is recorded as the captured image state information . Thereby the image capturing device enables the TV to display a more exact prediction time required to upload images not yet uploaded.

It is also possible to use not yet uploaded image information hashed information that is generated by hashing information regarding images not yet uploaded.

In addition it is also possible to record a final capturing time final capturing date time in the second memory . Later the TV reads the final capturing time . The TV is connected to the server to compare the final capturing time to a capturing date of an image that has been finally uploaded to the server . Thereby it is possible to easily determine whether or not there is any image not yet uploaded.

If images are captured and assigned with serial numbers sequentially from an older image it is possible to record only a final image serial number . The final image serial number is compared to a serial number of an image that has been finally uploaded to the server . Thereby it is possible to determine whether or not there is any image not yet uploaded.

It is also possible to record onto the second memory captured image information e.g. serial numbers of all captured images . Thereby the TV later accesses the server to match the serial numbers to images uploaded to the server . As a result it is possible to determine whether or not there is any image not yet uploaded. When the captured image information is used use of hashed information generated by hashing the captured image information can compress the captured image information .

The second memory further stores Unique IDentification UID of the RF ID unit camera ID and the medium identification information . Even if the main power of the camera except a sub power for backup etc. of a clock is OFF these pieces of information can be read by the TV via the second antenna to be used for identifying the camera or the user or authenticating a device apparatus . When the user comes back from an overseas trip or the like the camera is likely to have a small charge amount of the battery. However according to Embodiment A1 of the present invention the camera can be operated to transmit information without battery which is highly convenient for the user. The medium identification information includes an identifier or the like indicating whether the medium or device embedded with the RF ID unit is a camera a camcorder a post card a card or a mobile phone. The identifier enables the TV to identify the medium or device. Thereby the TV can display a mark or icon of the camera or postcard on a screen as illustrated in as will be described. The TV can also change processing depending on the identifier.

The second memory also stores image display method instruction information . For example in the situation where a list display information of whether or not to perform list display in is selected when the second antenna is moved into proximity of the RF ID reader writer of the TV the image capturing device camera causes the TV to display a list of thumbnails of images such as photographs.

In the situation where slide show is selected the image capturing device causes the TV to sequentially display images from a newer one or an older one.

In a lower part of the second memory in there is a region for recording the server specific information .

The server specific information allows a camera operator to display images on the TV screen by a preferred method.

The server specific information includes server URL generation information that is source information from which a server URL is generated.

An example of the server URL generation information is login ID . The server specific information has a region in which server address information and user identification information are recorded. In practical login ID and the like are recorded. In addition there is a region for storing a password . An encrypted password may be stored in the region. The above pieces of information are used to generate an URL by a URL generation unit that is provided in the image capturing device the RF ID unit the camera function used for capturing images in the image capturing device or the TV . The URL is used for accessing a group of images corresponding to the image capturing device or the user in the server . If the URL generation unit is provided in the RF ID unit the URL generation unit receives power from the second power supply unit .

It is also possible to generate URL without using the above pieces of information and store the generated URL directly to the second memory .

It is characterized in that the above described pieces of information stored in the second memory can be read by both the second processing unit in the RF ID unit and the first processing unit in the camera function.

The above structure allows the TV reading the RF ID unit in the camera to instantly obtain the pieces of information regarding uploading state the sever address information the login ID the password and the like. Thereby the TV can download image data corresponding to the camera from the server and display the image data at a high speed.

In the above situation even if the main power of the image capturing device is OFF the RF ID reader writer supplies power to the second power supply unit to activate operate the image capturing device . Therefore power of the battery in the image capturing device is not reduced.

Referring back to the first power supply unit receives power from the battery to provide power to the units in the camera. In a quiescent state however a third power supply unit provides weak power to the clock and the like. In some cases the third power supply unit supplies backup power to a part of the second memory .

The RF ID unit receives power from the second antenna to provide power to the second power supply unit thereby operating the second processing unit or operating a data receiving unit a recording unit a reproducing unit a data transfer unit the communication unit and the second memory .

Therefore in a quiescent state of the camera no power is consumed. As a result it is possible to keep the battery of the camera longer.

The processing performed by the image capturing device referred to also as a medium such as a camera or card and the processing performed by the TV and the RF ID reader writer are explained with reference to a flowchart of .

At Step the TV determines whether or not the TV is connected to a printer and there is an independent printer. If so then at Step the RF ID unit of the medium such as a post card is moved into proximity of a RF ID reader writer of the printer. At Step of the printer i reads UID of the RF ID from the medium ii thereby reads image data to be printed or a location of the image data from the print directory on the server having the modified information and iii prints the image data. At Step the printing is completed. Thereby the above processing is completed.

Step is the number circle in . At Step the TV determines whether or not the service is for shopping. If the service is for shopping then the TV determines at Step whether or not authentication is successful. If the authentication is successful then at Step the TV reads from the server a shopping billing program associated with the UID and executes the program. At Step the execution of the program is completed. Thereby the above processing is completed.

Next the following describes a method of reading information from a RF ID unit embedded in a post card without a RF ID reader.

At Step of the following processing is performed. A second RF ID unit on which URLs of relay servers are recorded is attached to or embedded in the medium such as a post card. On the outer surface of the second RF ID unit a UID of the second RF ID unit and b information for identifying a first URL of a certain relay server are printed to be displayed by a two dimensional bar code.

At Step there is a camera capable of being connected to a main server. The camera has a first RF ID unit on which a first URL of the main server is recorded. An image capturing unit in the camera optically reads the two dimensional bar code and converts the readout information to information for identifying a the UID of a second RF ID unit in the post card and b a second URL of a relay server.

At Step the camera selects a specific set of images from images captured by the camera and stores the set of images into a specific first directory in the main server. At the same time the camera uploads information of first directory first directory information as well as the first URL of the main server to a specific second directory in the relay server having the second URL. The camera uploads information for associating the UID of the second RF ID unit with the second directory to the relay server having the second URL. At Step the medium such as a post card is mailed to a specific person.

At Step the person receiving the post card moves the RF ID unit of the post card into proximity of a RF ID reader of a TV or the like. Thereby the TV reads from the RF ID unit the second URL of the relay server and the UID of the post card.

At Step the TV accesses the relay server having the second URL. Then the TV reads from the relay server a a program in the second directory associated with the UID and or b the first URL and the first directory information of the main server on which specific image data is recorded. The TV downloads the image data from the main server. The TV displays the image data on a screen. In the above case the image capturing unit in the image capturing device according to Embodiment A1 of the present invention reads information from the two dimensional bar code that is generally printed in a product or post card to record server information. Then the image capturing device records the information read from the two dimensional bar code as digital information onto the second memory of the RF ID unit. Thereby the image capturing device allows a RF ID reader of a TV to read the information. As a result even a TV without an optical sensor for two dimensional bar codes can indirectly read information of two dimensional bar codes and automatically access a server or the like.

 a in illustrates the situation where display is presented when the image capturing device is moved into proximity of a RF ID antenna of the TV .

When the image capturing device is moved into proximity of the antenna the TV displays a camera icon for notifying that the medium is a camera in the manner described previously.

Next since the number for example five of images not yet uploaded is detected the TV displays five blank images and as if these images were taken out from the camera icon .

Thereby the TV displays tangible information of images by changing materials to information . As a result the user can perceive the information of images by more natural sense.

Regarding images that have been already uploaded to the server actual images and are displayed as tangible data in the same manner as described above.

 b in illustrates the situation where RF ID is embedded in a post card . Since the RF ID reader writer of the TV reads attribute information of the post card from the RF ID. Thereby the TV displays a post card icon at a bottom left corner of the display unit of the TV as illustrated in . The TV also displays images stored in the server or a menu screen as tangible data in the same manner as described with reference to a in .

Next the following processing is described in detail. By the processing an operation program illustrated in is transmitted to the TV illustrated in that is an apparatus device communicating with the RF ID unit of the image capturing device . The communicating device TV executes the transmitted program.

Here the image capturing device is implemented as a camera which has the RF ID unit to perform proximity wireless communication with the RF ID reader writer . The RF ID reader writer is connected to the TV by an infrared communication path. The camera includes the antenna a data receiving unit the second memory and the data transfer unit . The antenna is used for the proximity wireless communication. The data receiving unit receives via the antenna an input signal provided from the RF ID reader writer . The second memory is a nonvolatile memory holding at least a the UID unit that is identification information for identifying the image capturing device and b the operation program that is to be executed by the TV with reference to the UID unit . The data transfer unit transmits the UID unit and the operation program stored in the second memory to the RF ID reader writer via the antenna according to the input signal received by the data receiving unit . The UID unit and the operation program transmitted from the data transfer unit are transmitted to the TV via the data transfer unit the antenna the RF ID reader writer and then the infrared communication path. The following explains the above units in more detail.

The RF ID unit in the image capturing device has the second memory . The second memory holds the operation program . The operation program can be executed by the TV communicating with the RF ID unit. In more detail the operation program is an example of the program executed by the TV with reference to the identification information of the image capturing device . The operation program is for example an execution program such as Java program a virtual machine script program such as Javascript program or the like.

The reproducing unit in the RF ID unit reads necessary information and the operation program from the second memory . The necessary information is required to execute the operation program . The necessary information includes the UID unique to the image capturing device the server specific information including the URL of the server and the like. The necessary information and the operation program are transmitted to the RF ID reader writer in the remote controller via the data transfer unit and the second antenna . The remote controller remotely controls the TV .

The RF ID reader writer of the remote controller receives the necessary information and the operation program from the RF ID unit of the image capturing device and stores them into a RF ID storage unit .

A remote controller signal generation unit in the remote controller converts the necessary information and the operation program which are transmitted from the RF ID unit of the image capturing device and stored in the RF ID storage unit to remote controller signals. The remote controller signals such as infrared signals are widely used in communication for present remote controllers.

To the TV a remote controller signal transmission unit transmits the remote controller signals including the operation program which are generated by the remote controller signal generation unit .

A remote controller signal receiving unit in the TV receives the remote controller signals from the remote controller . A program execution unit such as a Java virtual machine retrieves the necessary information and the operation program in the RF ID unit of the image capturing device from the remote controller signals by using a decryption unit . Thereby the program execution unit executes the operation program.

When the remote controller is moved into proximity of the image capturing device the RF ID reader writer of the remote controller provides power to the RF ID unit in the image capturing device via RF ID communication. Thereby the UID unique to the image capturing device the URL of the image server image server URL and the operation program are read from the second memory S . The readout UID image server URL and operation program are transmitted to the remote controller via the data transfer unit and the second antenna S . Here as presented in the operation program includes server connection instruction download instruction slide show display instruction download completion time processing set instruction and download completion time instruction .

The remote controller receives the UID the image server URL and the operation program from the image capturing device via the RF ID reader writer S . A determination is made as to whether or not receiving is completed S . If receiving is completed then the UID the image server URL and the operation program are stored in the RF ID storage unit S . Then the UID the image server URL and the operation program are converted to remote controller signals transmittable by infrared ray S . A determination is made as to whether or not the user performs a predetermined input operation by the remote controller to instruct to transmit the remote controller signals to the TV S . If the instruction is received by from user then the remote controller signal transmission unit transmits the remote controller signals including the UID the image server URL and the operation program to the TV S . In other words serving as a common remote controller the remote controller serves also as a relay device that transfers the UID the image server URL and the operation program from the image capturing device to the TV by using the embedded RF ID reader writer .

Next the TV receives the remote controller signals from the remote controller S . The decryption unit in the TV retrieves decrypts the UID the image server URL and the operation program from the remote controller signals S . Then the program execution unit executes the operation program with reference to the UID and the image server URL S to S . More specifically by the operation program connection between the TV and the image server on a communication network is established with reference to the image server URL S and in . Then with reference to the UID unique to a corresponding image capturing unit image data captured by a specific image capturing unit is selected from the image data stored in the storage device of the image server and the selected image data is downloaded to the TV S and in . In other words the UID is used to select image data associated with the image capturing device indicated by the UID from among pieces of image data stored in the image server . A determination is made as to whether or not the image download is completed S . If the image download is completed the downloaded images are sequentially displayed as a slide show S and and in . The download completion time processing set instruction in is instruction for setting processing to be performed when image downloading is completed. In the example of the download completion time processing set instruction instructs the instruction as the processing to be performed when image downloading is completed. Moreover the processing calls the processing for performing a slide show of the images.

It should be noted that referring to it has been described that the operation program and the necessary information for the operation program are transferred from the image capturing device to the TV via the remote controller . However the RF ID reader writer of the remote controller may be provided to the TV . In other words the RF ID reader writer may be embedded in the TV . Furthermore the communication path connecting the reader RF ID reader writer to the apparatus may be a wireless communication path such as infrared communication path or a wired signal cable.

It should also be noted that in the above described execution example the UID is used to select image data associated with the image capturing device from among pieces of image data stored in the image server . However it is also possible to use the UID to identify the image server storing the image data. Here it is assumed that in a communication system including a plurality of image servers UID is associated with an image server storing image data captured by an image capturing device identified by the UID. Under the assumption if the operation program is created so that a URL of the image server can be identified with reference to the UID the TV executing the operation program can identify by using the UID the image server associated with the UID from the plurality of image servers and thereby download the image data from the identified image server.

It should also be noted that the identification information for identifying the image capturing device is not limited to UID. The identification information maybe any other information regarding the image capturing device such as a serial number a product serial number a Media Access Control MAC address or information equivalent to the MAC address for example an Internet Protocol IP address. Moreover if the image capturing device serves as an access point on a wireless LAN the identification information maybe a Service Set Identifier SSID or any information equivalent to SSID. It should also be noted that in the above described second memory the identification information UID unit for identifying the image capturing device has been described to be stored separately from the operation program . However the identification information may be stored described in the operation program .

It should also be noted that the remote controller signals in other words the communication path connecting the reader to the apparatus are described to employ infrared ray. However the remote controller signals are not limited to the above but may employ a wireless communication method such as Bluetooth. The use of wireless communication that is generally speedier than infrared communication can shorten a time required to transfer an operation program and or the like.

It should be noted that the operation program is not limited to the program in the format presented in . The operation program may be described in any other programming language. For example the operation program described in Java can be easily executed by various apparatuses devices because the program execution circumstances called JavaVM have broad versatility. The operation program may be described in a compact programming language in a script format represented by Javascript so as to be stored in a small storage capacity. The operation program in such a compact programming language can be stored in the RF ID unit in the second memory even if the RF ID unit has a small storage capacity. Moreover the operation program may be in an executable format applied with processing such as compiling rather than a source code presented in . The program can reduce a processing load on apparatuses having program execution environments like TV.

The following describes in detail the processing of changing execution of a program depending on information unique to a display device such as the TV having a RF ID reader with reference to .

The TV illustrated in further includes a language code holding unit . When the operation program received as remote controller signals is executed to connect the TV to the server the program execution unit reads a language code from the language code holding unit to connect the TV to the server compliant to the language code. Then the operation program is executed to download a server program from the server and executes the downloaded server program. For example if the language code indicates Japanese language the TV is connected to the server having a program storage unit in which a server program compliant to Japanese language is stored and then the server program is obtained from the program storage unit to be executed in the TV . More specifically the operation program stored in the RF ID unit of the image capturing device as illustrated in executes only connection to the server while other processing such as image display is executed by the server program downloaded from the server .

The steps in the above processing are described with reference to . The processing by which the TV receives the operation program and the necessary information for the operation program from the RF ID unit of the image capturing device is the same as the processing described previously with reference to . In it is assumed that the server specific information which the TV receives as remote controller signals includes two different server addresses which are a a sever address of a server compliant to English and a a server address of a different server compliant to Japanese. It is also assumed that the operation program which the TV receives as remote controller signals includes instruction for connecting the TV to a server indicated by the server connection instruction in .

In the execution environments the TV obtains a language code of the TV S . The TV determines whether or not the language code indicates Japanese language S . If the language code indicates Japanese language then the TV selects from the server specific information a sever address of a server having a program storage unit storing an operation program for processing compliant to Japanese S . On the other hand if the language code does not indicate Japanese language then the TV selects from the server specific information a server address of a server having a program storage unit storing an operation program for processing compliant to English S . Next the TV is connected to the server with reference to the selected server address S . The TV downloads a server program from the server S S . The TV executes the downloaded server program in the program execution environments for example a virtual machine of the TV S .

It should be noted that the use of the language code has been described in but the language code may be replaced by other information. Examples are a product serial number a serial number of the display device TV and the like each of which indicates a country where the display device is on the market or equipped.

Embodiment A1 of the present invention can solve the above problem. In Embodiment A1 of the present invention RF ID is used to perform authentication. In more detail an authentication program including a MAC address is recorded as an operation program in the second memory in the RF ID unit of the image capturing device . When the image capturing device is moved into proximity of the RF ID reader writer of the TV the image capturing device provides the authentication program to the TV . The authentication program includes not only the MAC address but also a cryptography key for authentication hereinafter authentication cryptography key and an authentication command. When the TV recognizes that the information provided from the RF ID unit includes the authentication command the TV performs authentication processing. The communication unit in the RF ID unit cannot communicate with the TV until the image capturing device is physically located in proximity of the RF ID reader writer . Therefore it is extremely difficult to intercept the communication between the image capturing device and the TV which is performed in a house. In addition since the image capturing device is moved into proximity of the TV to exchange data it is possible to prevent that the image capturing device authenticates a wrong device apparatus such as the TV in a neighbor or a DVD recorder in the user s house.

The following is an example of an authentication method without using RF ID with reference to . A user inputs to the TV a MAC addresses of terminals to be authenticated such as the camera the image capturing device and the DVD recorder which the user intends to authenticate for communication and b authentication cryptography keys for the terminals. The TV receiving the inputs transmits an appropriate message called a challenge to a target terminal having the MAC address. When the image capturing device receives the challenge the image capturing device encrypts the challenge using the authentication cryptography key and returns the encrypted challenge to the TV that is a terminal from which the challenge has been provided. In receiving the encrypted challenge the TV decrypts the encrypted challenge using the authentication cryptography key . Thereby the TV can authenticate the authentication cryptography key to prevent user s error and intervention of other malicious users. Next the TV encrypts a cryptography key for data hereinafter a data cryptography key using the authentication cryptography key . Then the TV transmits the encrypted data cryptography key to the image capturing device . Thereby it is possible to perform the encrypted data communication between the TV and the image capturing device . The TV performs the above described processing also with the DVD recorder and other apparatuses terminals and in order to share the data cryptography key among them. Thereby the TV can perform encrypted communication with all terminals devices apparatuses or the like connected in the home network.

Next the following situation is described in detail with reference to figures. Here the image capturing device described with reference to generates or updates a program executable by the TV . Then the image capturing device transmits the program to the TV via the data transmission unit . Thereby the TV executes the program.

The first processing unit includes a second memory reading unit a URL generation unit a program generation unit a program part storage unit and a program writing unit .

The second memory reading unit reads information from the second memory via the recording reproducing unit .

The URL generation unit reads the UID the server specific information the captured image state information and the image display method instruction information from the second memory via the second memory reading unit . From the above pieces of information the URL generation unit generates a URL that is an address of the server to which images have been uploaded from the image capturing device .

The UID is identification information for identifying the image capturing device . The UID is unique to each image capturing device . The URL generated by the URL generation unit includes UID. For instance the image server to which images are uploaded has an image file in a directory unique to each UID. Thereby a URL address can be generated for each image capturing device .

The server specific information is a server name for identifying the server to which the images are uploaded. Via a Domain Name Server DNS an IP address of the server is determined to connect the image capturing device to the server . Therefore the server specific information is included in the generated URL.

The image display method instruction information is information for enabling the user to optionally select the list display the slide show display or the like. The URL generation unit generates the URL based on the image display method instruction information . In other words since the generated URL includes information indicating the list display or the slide show display the image server the server can determine based on the URL whether the images are to be displayed as the list display or the slide show display.

As described above based on the UID the server specific information the captured image state information the image display method instruction information and the like which are stored in the second memory the URL generation unit generates a URL of the image server in which images to be watched are stored. Then the URL generation unit provides the generated URL to the program generation unit .

The program generation unit generates a program executable by the TV based on a the URI generated by the URL generation unit and b forced display instruction forced print instruction and format identification information stored in the second memory . It should be noted that the program generation unit can generate a new operation program based on the above described information which is a method of generating a new operation program. The program generation unit can also generate such a new operation program by updating an operation program that has been already generated.

The program generated by the program generation unit is executable by the TV . The program should be compiled into a machine language used in a system controller not shown of the TV so that the system controller can execute the program. In this case the program generation unit has a compiler to convert the generated program to a program in an executable format.

However the above described compiler is not necessary if the program in a text format script for example a general Java script is executed by a browser in the TV .

The URL provided to the program generation unit is used to connect the TV to the image server server in which images are stored. By using the URL the program generation unit generates or updates a connection program hereinafter referred to also as a server connection program or connection program for connecting the TV to the image server.

The forced display instruction is optional and used in the following situation. For example there is the situation where while the user watches on the TV a TV program provided by general broadcast waves the RF ID reader writer of the TV becomes communicable with the image capturing device via the second antenna . In the situation the forced display instruction is used to automatically set the TV into a browser watching mode so that image data provided from the image server is displayed on the TV . If this option is selected the program generation unit generates a program for forcing the TV to display image data.

The forced print instruction is optional and used in the following situation. For example there is the situation where while the user watches on the TV a TV program provided by general broadcast waves the RF ID reader writer of the TV becomes communicable with the image capturing device via the second antenna . In the situation the forced print instruction is used to automatically print image data stored in the image server by a printer not shown connected to the TV . If this option is selected the program generation unit generates a program for forcing the TV to print image data by the printer.

The format identification information is information of a format by which image data is to be displayed. When an option of language code optimization selection in the format identification information is selected the program generation unit generates a program for selecting a URL to be connected based on the language code set in the TV . The following is an example in the situation where the option of language code optimization selection in the format identification information is selected. If the language code of the TV indicates Japanese language the program generation unit selects a Japanese site as the URL to be connected. On the other hand if the language code of the TV does not indicate Japanese language the program generation unit selects an English site as the URL to be connected. Or the URL generation unit may generate two URLs for the Japanese site and the English site and provide the two URLs to the program generation unit .

The program part storage unit holds program command information used by the program generation unit to generate a program. A program part stored in the program part storage unit may be a general library or an Application Programming Interface API . In order to generate a connection command for connecting the TV to the server the program generation unit combines a server connection command Connect in the program part storage unit with the URL generated by the URL generation unit . Thereby the program generation unit generates or updates a connection program for connecting the TV to the server indicated by the URL.

The program writing unit is an interface used to write the program generated by the program generation unit to the second memory .

The program provided from the program writing unit is stored into a program storage unit in the second memory via the recording reproducing unit .

When the image capturing device is moved to bring the RF ID unit of the image capturing device into proximity of the RF ID reader writer connected to the TV the reproducing unit reads out the program from the program storage unit in the second memory . Then transmission signals indicating the program are transmitted to the RF ID reader writer via the data transfer unit and the second antenna . The TV receives the transmission signals via the RF ID reader writer . The TV executes the received program.

The product serial number is a product serial number of the TV . From the product serial number it is possible to learn a manufacture date time a manufacture location a manufacturing line and a manufacturer of the TV .

The language code is predetermined in the TV to be used in displaying a menu for example. The language code is not limited to be predetermined but can be switched to another by the user.

The program execution virtual machine is a virtual machine that executes a received program. The program execution virtual machine may be implemented as hardware or software. For example the program execution virtual machine may be a Java virtual machine. The Java virtual machine is a stack or interpreter virtual machine that executes defined instruction sets. If the image capturing device has the virtual machine the program generated by the program generation unit in the image capturing device is compliant to any execution platforms. As a result the program generation unit can generate a program executable in any platforms.

Next based on the server specific information stored in the second memory the program generation unit generates a connection command for connecting the TV to the server by using the URL generated by the URL generation unit . In order to generate the connection command the program generation unit selects an instruction set for example Connect in for a server connection command from the program part storage unit and combines the selected instruction set with the URL. Thereby a server connection program for example Connect URL is generated.

Then the program generation unit examines the forced display instruction in the second memory so as to determine whether or not the forced display instruction is selected S . If the forced display instruction is selected then the program generation unit calls an instruction set for a forced display program from the program part storage unit and thereby generates a forced display command S . The generated forced display command is added to the program S .

On the other hand if the forced display instruction is not selected then the program generation unit does not generate the forced display command but proceeds to S.

Next the program generation unit makes a determination as to whether the forced print instruction in the second memory is selected S . If the forced print instruction is selected then the program generation unit generates a forced print command for forcing the TV to print by a printer an image file stored in the server S . The generated print command is added to the program S .

Then the program generation unit examines the image display method instruction information in the second memory so as to determine whether or not the list display is selected S . If the list display is selected then the program generation unit generates a list display command for causing the TV to display a list of the image file stored in the server S . The generated list display command is added to the program S .

After that the program generation unit examines the image display method instruction information in the second memory so as to determine whether or not the slide show is selected S . If the slide show is selected then the program generation unit generates a slide show command for causing the TV to display a slide show of the image file stored in the server S . The generated slide show command is added to the program S .

As described above based on the information set in the second memory the program generation unit in the image capturing device generates a program used to display images on the TV by using an instruction command set that is stored in the program part storage unit to generate the program.

It should be noted that in Embodiment A1 there are commands for the forced display instruction the forced print instruction the list display and the slide show display. However the commands programs are not limited to the above. For example if a command for the forced display instruction is to be generated as a program the program generation unit can also generate a determination command for determining whether or not the apparatus device executing the program has a display device or display function and add the generated determination command to the program. Thereby the command for the forced display instruction is executed only if the apparatus executing the program has a display device or display function. As a result the determination command can prevent confusion in the apparatus executing the program. The same goes for a command for the forced print instruction. The program generation unit may also generate a determination command for determining whether or not the apparatus executing the program has or is connected to a printing function and add the generated determination command to the program. Thereby the command for the forced print instruction is executed only if the apparatus executing the program has or is connected to a printing function.

The following describes execution of the program generated or updated by the program generation unit in the image capturing device .

The program is transmitted from the image capturing device to a device apparatus different from the image capturing device via the second antenna of the image capturing device . Then the program is executed by the different device. In Embodiment A1 the different device is the TV . The TV receives the program via the RF ID reader writer and executes the received program by a controller or virtual machine not shown in the TV .

First the program is executed to read the language code set in the TV as unique information of the TV S . The language code is predetermined by the user to be used in displaying a menu and the like on the TV .

Next the program is executed to determine a language indicated in the language code. First a determination is made as to whether or not the language code indicates Japanese language S . If the determination is made that the language code indicates Japanese language then a connection command for a Japanese site is selected from the connection commands in the program S . On the other hand if the determination is made that the language code does not indicate Japanese language then a connection command for an English site is selected from the connection commands in the program S . It should be noted that it has been described in Embodiment A1 that a determination is made as to whether or not the language code indicates Japanese language and thereby a connection command is selected from the connection command for connecting to a Japanese site and the connection command for connecting to an English site. However it is also possible that the program includes a plurality of connection programs compliant to various language codes. Thereby the program can be compliant to two or more language codes. As a result usability is improved. Next according to the selected connection command the program is executed to connect the TV to the URL indicted in the connection command S .

Then a determination is made as to whether or not the connection to the URL indicted in the connection command is successful S . If the connection is failed then the display unit of the TV displays warning indicating the connection failure S . On the other hand if the connection is successful then a command for displaying a slide show of an image file stored in the server is executed to display the slide show S .

It should be noted that the above is the situation where the operation program is for displaying images as a slide show. However the operation program is not limited to the above. The program may be used for performing list display forced display or forced printing. If the operation program is for forced display a step command of automatically changing setting of the TV to setting of displaying an image file stored in the server is added to the program. Thereby the user does not need to change the setting of the TV by manual in order to display images provided from the image server. In the case of the forced printing a command for automatically changing setting of the TV to a printable mode is added to the program. Moreover in the case of each of the forced printing and forced display a determination command for determining whether or not the TV has a printing function or a displaying function is added to the program. Thereby the forced print command is not executed in an apparatus device without a printing function. Furthermore the operation program in Embodiment A1 of the present invention may be a connection program for leading other programs. For example the operation program may be a loader program such as a boot loader for loading other programs to be executed.

As described above Embodiment A1 of the present invention is characterized in that the program generation unit is included in the first processing unit of the image capturing device that is a device having RF ID communication means such as the data transfer unit and the second antenna . It is also characterized in that the program generated or updated by the program generation unit is executed by a different device apparatus except the image capturing device according to Embodiment A1 of the present invention that is a communication device having RF ID.

Conventionally a device having RF ID needs to transfer ID information tag information which the device has from a RF ID communication unit to another device for example the TV according to Embodiment A1 of the present invention . The device apparatus receiving the ID information should previously hold operation programs each unique to a corresponding device having RF ID. Therefore if new products having RF ID technology appear the receiving device needs to install an operation program corresponding to the new products and execute the program. Otherwise the receiving device is excluded as not being compliant to the new products. The installation of operation programs requires technical knowledge. Not everyone can perform the installation. Therefore if various new devices having RF ID are produced other devices such as the TV of Embodiment A1 of the present invention become obsolete. As a result property values of user s devices are damaged.

According to the disclosure of Embodiment A1 of the present invention the device having RF ID technology has the program generation unit and sends not ID information tag information but a program to another device apparatus such as the TV . The apparatus such as the TV receives and executes the program. Therefore the receiving apparatus does not need to previously have operation programs for various devices having RF ID. Even if a new device having RF ID technology appears the receiving apparatus does not need to install a new program for the device. Therefore usability is significantly improved.

Therefore the terminal such as a TV does not need to previously have application programs for respective items kinds or application systems of various objects having RF ID. Thereby the terminal such as a TV does not need to previously have a storage device either for holding various application programs. In addition maintenance such as version up of the programs in the terminal is not necessary.

The program generated by the program generation unit is useful if it is executable in any execution platforms such as a Java language. Therefore if the device apparatus such as the TV executing programs has a Java virtual machine programs generated by any devices apparatuses can be executed.

It should be noted that the program generation unit according to Embodiment A1 of the present invention may have a function of updating the program previously stored in the program storage unit of the second memory . The situation of updating a program produces the same advantages as that in the situation of generating a program. The generating or updating performed by the program generation unit may be generating or updating data used in executing a program by the TV . In general the program includes additional initialization setting data. The additional data is used to switch an execution mode or to set a flag. Therefore generating or updating of the additional data is equivalent to generating or updating of the program without deviating from the inventive concepts of the present invention. This is because for execution of a program it is merely a matter of design whether a parameter for mode switching or the like is to be held and read as data or is to be included in the program to be executed. Therefore when the program generation unit according to Embodiment A1 of the present invention generates or updates a program the program generation unit can also generate data such a parameter sequence used by the program. The parameter is generated based on the forced display instruction the forced print instruction the image display method instruction information the format identification information or the like stored in the second memory .

The following describes characteristic structures and processing of the second memory and the first processing unit in the image capturing device that is a communication device having RF ID according to Embodiment A1 of the present invention. In Embodiment A1 of the present invention the image capturing device that is a communication device having RF ID has a use status detection unit in the first processing unit . The use status detection unit detects a trouble related to operation a power consumption status or the like. The image capturing device generates a program for displaying the result of the detection use status on the TV that is a device apparatus different from the image capturing device .

The second memory includes the UID the server specific information the camera ID and the program storage unit .

The UID is a serial number unique to the image capturing device and used to identify the single image capturing device .

The server specific information is information for identifying the server to which image data captured by the image capturing device is transmitted by the communication unit . The server specific information includes a sever address a storing directory a login account a login passwords and the like.

The camera ID includes a product serial number a manufacturing year month date a manufacturer a manufacturing line a manufactured location and the like of the image capturing device . The camera ID also includes camera model information for identifying a model of the image capturing device .

The first processing unit includes the second memory reading unit a use status detection unit the program generation unit the program part storage unit and the program writing unit .

The second memory reading unit reads information from the second memory via the recording reproducing unit . In Embodiment A1 of the present invention the second memory reading unit reads the UID the server specific information and the camera ID from the second memory and provides the pieces of information to the program generation unit . Reading of the pieces of information from the second memory is performed when a readout signal is provided from the use status detection unit that is described later.

The use status detection unit detects a use status of each unit included in the image capturing device . The use status detection unit includes sensors each detecting a trouble in operation of a corresponding unit included in the image capturing device . Results of the detection of the sensors in respective units are provided to the use status detection unit . The sensors for the respective units provide the use status detection unit with trouble information battery duration a power consumption amount and the like. For example the image capturing unit provides the use status detection unit with information indicating whether or not an image capturing operation of the image capturing unit has any trouble whether or not the image capturing unit functions correctly and whether or not the image capturing unit responds to a call from the use status detection unit . The video processing unit provides the use status detection unit with information indicating whether or not data processing for image data captured by the image capturing unit has any trouble whether or not the video processing unit functions correctly and whether or not the video processing unit responds to a call from the use status detection unit . The power supply unit provides the use status detection unit with a voltage level of the battery and a total power consumption amount. The communication unit provides the use status detection unit with information indicating whether or not the communication unit is successfully connected to the server or the Internet whether or not the communication unit functions correctly and whether or not the communication unit responds to a call from the use status detection unit . The display unit provides the use status detection unit with information indicating whether or not display processing has any trouble whether or not the display unit correctly responds to a call from the use status detection unit and the display unit functions correctly. Based on the above pieces of status information provided regarding the respective units the internal trouble detection unit in the use status detection unit determines whether or not each of the units has any trouble in its functional operation. If there is a trouble then the use status detection unit provides the program generation unit with information for specifying the trouble. The use status detection unit has a power consumption detection unit . The power consumption detection unit generates power consumption information based on the total power consumption information provided form the power supply unit and then provides the power consumption information to the program generation unit .

The program generation unit generates a program for displaying on the TV the information for specifying a trouble or the power consumption information which is provided from the use state detection unit . For generation of a program instruction sets to be included in the program are previously stored in the program part storage unit . Therefore the program generation unit generates a a display command display in for displaying a trouble or a power consumption amount and b a program for displaying information for specifying a location of the trouble and information for specifying the trouble in detail. It should be noted that the power consumption amount may be converted to a carbon dioxide emission amount and therefore a program may be generated to display the carbon dioxide emission amount.

The program generated by the program generation unit is stored in the program storage unit in the second memory via the program writing unit .

The program stored in the program storage unit in the second memory is transmitted to the RF ID reader writer of the TV via the data transfer unit and then the second antenna .

With the above described structure the program generation unit in the first processing unit generates a program for displaying on the TV trouble information or use status information detected by the use status detection unit regarding use of the image capturing device . The program is transmitted to the TV that displays the trouble information or the use status information of the image capturing device . Thereby the TV can present the trouble information or the use status information to the user without installing a plurality of programs compliant to various devices including the image capturing device .

In conventional systems each of devices such as an image capturing device a camcorder an electric toothbrush and a weight scale is provided with a simple display function such as a liquid crystal device so as to display the trouble information or the use status information on the corresponding display function. Therefore the display function has a low display capability for merely displaying the trouble information as a symbol sequence or an error code. When the trouble information is presented the user needs to read instruction manual to check what kind of trouble it is. Some users have lost instruction manual and therefore obtain more information from a website on the Internet.

In the system according to Embodiment A1 of the present invention however a program for displaying trouble information can be executed by the TV not by the image capturing device . The TV which displays the trouble information detected by each device such as the image capturing device has a display capability higher than that of the conventional systems. Therefore the system according to Embodiment A1 of the present invention can solve the above conventional problem.

The following describes in detail with reference to figures the situation where a program generated by the image capturing device described with reference to is executed by a plurality of apparatuses devices including the TV .

The system includes the image capturing device the TV a remote controller with display function and a remote controller without display function .

The TV includes the RF ID reader writer and a wireless communication device . The wireless communication device is for example a general infrared communication device currently used as many remote controllers of home appliances or a short range wireless communication device used for home appliances using radio waves such as Bluetooth and ZigBee.

The remote controller with display function includes a transmission unit a display unit an input unit a RF ID reader a memory and a program execution virtual machine . The transmission unit transmits signals to the wireless communication device of the TV . The display unit displays video. The input unit receives key inputs from a user. The RF ID reader communicates with the RF ID unit . The memory stores a program received by the RF ID reader . The program execution virtual machine is a virtual machine that executes the program received by the RF ID reader . For instance recent mobile phones are example of the remote controller with display function having an infrared communication function Bluetooth a RF ID reader a liquid crystal display a key input unit a Java virtual machine and the like. The display unit and the input unit may be a liquid crystal display and a plurality of character input buttons or may be integrated into a liquid crystal touch panel for example.

The remote controller without display function includes a transmission unit an input unit a RF ID reader and a memory . The transmission unit transmits signals to the wireless communication device of the TV . The input unit such as buttons receives key inputs from a user. The RF ID reader communicates with the RF ID unit . The memory temporarily stores data received by the RF ID reader .

The remote controller without display function is for example a general remote controller having a RF ID reader. Remote controllers are common accessory devices of TVs.

In Embodiment A1 of the present invention there are the following four possible situations from which the user selects a preferred one. In the first situation the program generated by the image capturing device is transmitted directly to the TV via the RF ID reader writer of the TV and executed by the TV . In the second situation the program generated by the image capturing device is transmitted indirectly to the TV via the remote controller without display function and executed by the TV . In the third situation the program generated by the image capturing device is transmitted indirectly to the TV via the remote controller with display function and executed by the TV . In the fourth situation the program generated by the image capturing device is transmitted to the remote controller with display function and executed by the remote controller with display function .

The first situation has been already described above in Embodiment A1. Therefore the first situation is not described in detail again below.

In the second situation a program generated by the image capturing device is executed by the TV via the remote controller without display function such as general TV remote controllers that does not have a graphical display device such as a liquid crystal panel.

When the user moves the image capturing device to bring the RF ID unit to the RF ID reader the RF ID reader reads the program generated by the image capturing device to store the program in the memory .

Then when the user presses the input unit the program held in the memory is transmitted from the transmission unit to the wireless communication device of the TV . The program execution virtual machine in the TV executes the program. If the wireless communication device is a directional infrared communication device the user presses the input unit facing the remote controller without display function to the TV . If the wireless communication device is a non directional short range wireless communication device such as devices using Bluetooth or ZigBee the program is transmitted to the TV that is previously paired with the remote controller without display function . In the case of the short range wireless communication device it is also possible that the program is automatically transmitted to the paired TV when the RF ID reader reads the program from the RF ID unit without user s pressing of the input unit .

The remote controller without display function may have a display unit such as a LED for notifying the user of that data read by the RF ID reader is stored in the memory . The LED is lit up to encourage the user to press the input unit when the program is read by the RF ID reader and stored in the memory . The LED is lit out when the transmission of the program to the TV is completed. Thereby it is possible to clearly notify the user of that the remote controller without display function holds the program. The LED may be an independent LED or integrated into the input unit .

In the second situation even if the user is far from the TV the program can be executed by the TV by using the remote controller without display function in the user s hand.

In the third and fourth situations if the remote controller with display function has a program execution virtual machine as high function mobile phones called smart phones do the user can select whether the program generated by the image capturing device is executed on the remote controller with display function or the program is transmitted to the TV to be executed on the TV .

When the user moves the image capturing device to bring the RF ID unit to the RF ID reader the RF ID reader reads the program generated by the image capturing device to store the program in the memory .

The following describes the processing performed by the remote controller with display function in more detail with reference to a flowchart of .

First a program read by the RF ID reader is transmitted to the program execution virtual machine and executed by the program execution virtual machine S .

Next a determination is made as to whether or not the remote controller has a display function S . If the remote controller does not have any display function N at S then the program is transmitted to the TV via the transmission unit and then the processing is completed. In this situation the program is executed by the TV .

If the remote controller has a display function Y at S then a further determination is made as to whether or not the remote controller is paired with the TV that is a transmission destination S . If the remote controller is not paired with the TV N at S then a rest processing of the program is executed by the display unit of the remote controller . On the other hand if the remote controller is paired with the TV Y at S then the display unit displays a dialog message Display on TV or on Remote Controller to encourage the user to select one of the options S .

Then the remote controller receives user s entry by the input unit S . A determination is made as to whether or the user selects to display data on the TV S . If the user selects the TV to display data Y at S then the program is transmitted to the TV via the transmission unit and thereby the processing is completed. In this situation the program is executed by the TV . On the other hand if the user selects the remote controller to display data N at S then a rest processing of the program is executed by the remote controller using the display unit S .

It should be noted that the rest processing of the program refers to displaying of a status of a battery a trouble status or an instruction manual regarding the image capturing device but of course not limited to those described in Embodiment A1.

With the above structure a program generated by the image capturing device is transmitted to the remote controller with display function then a capability of the remote controller with display function is examined and a determination is made by the remote controller as to which apparatus device is to execute rest processing of the program. Thereby the remote controller does not need to previously install various programs compliant to a plurality of apparatuses. The user can execute the program in his her preferred manner.

It should be noted that it has been described in Embodiment A1 that the determination is made based on whether or not the remote controller has a display function and based on a pairing status of the remote controller. However it is not limited to the above. A program may execute any determination based on a capability of the apparatus such as a communication capability an audio video reproduction capability a capability of an input unit a capability of an output device and the like.

As described above the storage region of the RF ID unit holds not only information but also a program describing operations of an apparatus device . This considerably simplify changing or updating of a program which has been necessary for conventional techniques to change operations of apparatuses. In addition it is possible to deal with addition of various new functions and an increase of cooperative apparatuses. Moreover proximity communication using RF ID technology is a simple operation achieved by simply bringing a device into proximity of an apparatus which the user can easily understand. Therefore conventional bothersome device operations by using buttons and a menu are simplified. As a result the complicated device operations are changed to be convenient.

Embodiment A2 of the present invention is described below. In Embodiment A2 actual operations of the communication system are described. In the communication system images captured by a camera are uploaded to a server and then downloaded by a simple operation to a TV to be displayed. The whole configuration of the communication system according to Embodiment A2 is the same as that of the communication system according to Embodiment A1.

The second memory updating process of Step S enables the server and the camera to share identification information for distinguishing photographs that have already been uploaded to the server from photographs that have not yet been uploaded to the server . Examples of the uploading process at Step S are given as following cases to .

In case the final capturing time final capturing date time is previously stored in the second memory and then updated after the captured images are stored into the third memory Step S .

Comparison of a time of uploading the captured images to the final capturing time of the camera allows the server and the camera to share identification information of the uploaded photographs.

In case the above advantages can be produced also by generating existence identifiers of images not yet uploaded to the server with reference to images uploaded to the server among the captured images and storing the generated existence identifiers into the second memory Step S .

In case it is also possible that the not yet uploaded image information hashed information is stored in the second memory Step S . Thereby an amount of the information stored in the second memory is reduced thereby saving a capacity of the second memory.

In case it is further possible that image serial numbers are chronologically generated for captured images and thereby the final image serial number in the second memory is updated Step S . Thereby even if a time counted by the camera is not correct it is possible to synchronize information of uploaded photographs between the server and the camera.

The camera reads from the second memory the server specific information including the server address information the login ID and the password Step S . Based on the server specific information the camera generates a URL Step S .

The cases to in correspond to the above described cases to of the second memory updating process in respectively.

In case the camera receives from the server a final upload time final upload date time that is a time of finally uploading to the server Step S . Then the camera compares the final upload time to the final capturing time Step S . If the final capturing time is later than the final upload time in other words if there is any image captured after final uploading then the camera uploads to the server any images captured after the final upload time Step S .

In case the camera checks not yet uploaded image data existence identifiers in the second memory Step S .

Thereby the camera determines whether or not there is any image not yet uploaded Step S . If there is any image not yet uploaded then the camera uploads images not yet uploaded to the server Step S . Then the camera updates the uploaded image information in the second memory Step S .

In case the camera checks the not yet uploaded image information hashed information in the second memory Step S . Thereby the camera determines whether or not the not yet uploaded image information hashed information in the second memory is the same as hashed information that is generated by hashing NULL Step S . If the not yet uploaded image information hashed information is not the same as the hashed information regarding NULL then the camera determines that there is an image not yet uploaded to the server and therefore uploads to the server any images that are stored in the third memory but have not yet been uploaded to the server Step S .

In case the camera receives from the server an image serial number of a finally uploaded image Step S . Then the camera determines whether or not the image serial number matches the final image serial number in the second memory Step S . If the image serial number does not match the final image serial number then the camera uploads any images having UIDs that are newer than UID of the final image serial number that is received from the server Step S .

First the second antenna embedded in the image capturing device receives weak radio power from polling of the RF ID reader writer of the TV and thereby activates the RF ID unit operated under the second power supply unit S .

The RF ID unit of the image capturing device which is activated by receiving weak power at Step S responds to the polling of the RF ID reader writer of the TV Step S .

After responding to the polling at Step S mutual authentication is performed to determine whether or not the RF ID unit of the image capturing device and the RF ID reader writer of the TV are legitimate devices and also to share a cryptography key used for secure information communication between the image capturing device and the TV Step S . The mutual authentication employs a public key cryptography algorism such as elliptic curve cryptography. In general the employed method for the mutual authentication is the same as that of mutual authentication used in communication via High Definition Multimedia Interface HDMI or IEEE1394.

As described earlier at Step S the mutual authentication is performed between the RF ID unit of the image capturing device and the RF ID reader writer of the TV to generate a common cryptography key. After that the server URL generation information is read from the server specific information stored in the second memory readable from the RF ID unit . The server URL generation information is transmitted to the RF ID reader writer of the TV via the second antenna Step S . The server URL generation information includes the server address information indicating address information of the server the user identification information that is the login ID to the server and the password that is a login password to the server . The password is important information for preventing unauthorized acts of a malicious third person. Therefore the password is sometimes encrypted beforehand as the encrypted password to be stored and then transmitted to the TV .

After the server URL generation information is transmitted to the RF ID reader writer of the TV at Step S the captured image state information stored in the second memory is also transmitted to the RF ID reader writer of the TV via the second antenna Step S . The captured image state information is the final capturing time case the existence identifiers which are existence identification information regarding images not yet uploaded and each of which is assigned to a corresponding one of the captured images so that it is possible to determine whether the image has not yet been uploaded case the not yet uploaded image information hashed information case or the final image serial number from among image serial numbers chronologically assigned to captured images case . The captured image state information is important for examining synchronization between captured images in the image capturing device and captured images in the server .

In case the final capturing time is used as the captured image state information . Therefore the TV compares the final capturing time to the final upload time. If the final capturing time is temporally later than the final upload time that is a time of finally uploading to the server then it is determined that the image data in the image capturing device is not in synchronization with the image data in the server . Therefore warning information regarding the synchronization failure is displayed on the display unit of the TV .

In case the captured image state information is the existence identifiers each of which is assigned to a corresponding one of the captured images so that it is possible to determine whether the image has not yet been uploaded. Therefore the TV examines the existence identifiers to determine whether or not there is any image not yet uploaded. If there is any image not yet uploaded then it is determined that the image data in the image capturing device is not in synchronization with the image data in the server . Therefore warning information regarding the synchronization failure is displayed on the display unit of the TV .

In case the not yet uploaded image information hashed information is employed as the captured image state information . Therefore the TV examines the not yet uploaded image information hashed information to determine whether or not there is any image not yet uploaded. If there is any image not yet uploaded then it is determined that the image data in the image capturing device is not in synchronization with the image data in the server . Therefore warning information regarding the synchronization failure is displayed on the display unit of the TV .

In case the captured image state information is the final image serial number from among image serial numbers chronologically assigned to the captured images. Therefore the TV compares a the final image serial number from among image serial numbers chronologically assigned to the captured images to b an image serial number of an image finally uploaded to the server . Here the final image serial number is provided from the image capturing device while the image serial number is provided from the server . Based on the comparison the TV can determine whether or not there is any image not yet uploaded. If there is any image not yet uploaded then it is determined that the image data in the image capturing device is not in synchronization with the image data in the server . Therefore warning information regarding the synchronization failure is displayed on the display unit of the TV .

After transmitting the captured image state information from the second antenna of the image capturing device to the RF ID reader writer of the TV at Step S the image display method instruction information is also transmitted from the second memory of the image capturing device to the RF ID reader writer of the TV via the second antenna Step S . The image display method instruction information is identification information indicating how the display unit of the TV is to display the images downloaded from the server . The image display method instruction information includes the list display indicator indicating that the images are to be displayed in a list and the slide show indicator indicating that the images are to be displayed as a slide show.

As described above at Steps S to S the image capturing device transmits the server URL generation information the captured image state information and the image display method instruction information which are stored in the second memory of the image capturing device from the second antenna of the image capturing device to the RF ID reader writer of the TV . Here it is desirable to encrypt all of the above pieces of information to be transmitted by using the cryptography key information shared between the image capturing device and the TV at the mutual authentication. The encryption achieves secure information communication between the image capturing device and the TV . As a result intervention of a malicious third person can be prevented.

Since the server URL generation information is transmitted to the TV the server and directory to which the first antenna of the image capturing device transmits data is the same as the server and directory from which the TV downloads the data. Therefore the TV can display the images that have been captured by the image capturing device and then uploaded to the server .

In addition the transmission of the captured image state information to the TV makes it possible to examine synchronization between the captured images stored in the third memory of the image capturing device and the images uploaded from the first antenna to the server . Therefore the TV can detect a failure of the synchronization. The display of the warning information indicating the synchronization failure on the TV can prevent unnecessary confusion of the user.

Moreover the transmission of the image display method instruction information to the TV enables the user to view images by a set image viewing method without designating the image viewing method on the TV . The user merely needs to move the image capturing device into proximity of the TV . The complicated operations using a remote controller or the like of the TV are not necessary. The images can be automatically displayed by the set viewing method.

The TV according to Embodiment A2 includes the RF ID reader writer the decryption unit a URL generation unit a communication unit a transmission unit a communication interface a receiving unit a data processing unit a memory unit a display unit and a CPU .

The RF ID reader writer communicates with the RF ID unit of the image capturing device via the second antenna . The RF ID reader writer includes a wireless antenna a receiving unit and a communicable device search unit polling unit .

The wireless antenna performs proximity wireless communication with the second antenna of the image capturing device . The wireless antenna has the same structure as that of wireless antennas of general purpose RF ID reader writers.

The communicable device search unit polling unit performs polling to check a RF ID unit of each of plural cameras in order to examine whether to have any transmission request or processing request . If the communicable device search unit receives a response of the polling from the RF ID unit of the image capturing device the corresponding camera then the mutual authentication is performed to share a common cryptography key between the TV and the image capturing device .

When the mutual authentication is completed after receiving the polling response the receiving unit receives the server URL generation information the captured image state information and the image display method instruction information from the second memory via the second antenna of the image capturing device .

The decryption unit decrypts the server URL generation information the captured image state information and the image display method instruction information which are received by the receiving unit . The decryption of the server URL generation information the captured image state information and the image display method instruction information which have been encrypted is performed using the cryptography key shared between the image capturing device and the TV after the mutual authentication by the communicable device search unit polling unit .

The URL generation unit generates based on the server URL generation information a URL to access the server and then transmits the generated URL to the communication unit. The URL includes not only the server specific information but also the login ID and the password used to login to the server.

The communication unit communicates with the server via a general purpose network using the communication interface .

The transmission unit transmits the URL generated by the URL generation unit via the communication interface in order to connect the TV to the server .

The communication interface is a communication interface for connecting the TV to the server via a general purpose network. The communication interface is for example a wired wireless LAN interface.

The receiving unit receives downloads image data and an image display cascading style sheet CSS from the serer connected by the communication interface .

The data processing unit performs data processing for the image data downloaded by the receiving unit . If the image data to be downloaded is compressed data the data processing unit de compresses the image data. If the image data is encrypted the data processing unit decrypts the image data. In addition the data processing unit can arrange the downloaded image data by an image display style based on the image display CSS. If it is determined based on the captured image state information obtained if necessary by decryption of the decryption unit that the image data in the image capturing device is not in synchronization with the image data in the server then the data processing unit causes the display unit to display warning information regarding the synchronization failure. Thereby unnecessary confusion of the user can be prevented. Moreover the data processing unit sets a mode of displaying the downloaded image data according to the image display method instruction information provided from the decryption unit . For example if the list display flag in the image display method instruction information is ON then the data processing unit generates a list of the downloaded images and provides the list to the memory unit . If the slide show flag in the image display method instruction information is ON then the data processing unit generates a slide show of the downloaded images and provides the slide show to the memory unit .

The memory unit is a memory that temporarily holds the image data processed by the data processing unit .

The display unit displays the image data stored in the memory unit . The image data has been downloaded from the server and applied with data processing by the data processing unit as described earlier.

As descried above based on the server URL generation information the captured image state information and the image display method instruction information which are received from the RF ID unit of the image capturing device the TV according to Embodiment A2 of the present invention can be connected to the server then download the uploaded image data from the server and display the downloaded image data on the display unit . Thereby the user does not need to do complicated processes of removing the third memory such as a Secure Digital SD card or a flash memory from the image capturing device and equipping the third memory to a card reader of the TV in order to view captured images. In Embodiment A2 of the present invention the user can display and view captured image data by simple operations of simply presenting the RF ID unit of the image capturing device to the RF ID reader writer of the TV for proximity communication. Embodiment A2 of the present invention can provide a captured image viewing system by which even users who are not familiar with operations of digital devices can easily view image data.

First the communicable device search unit in the RF ID reader writer of the TV transmits a polling signal to search for the RF ID unit of the communicable image capturing device Step S .

When the image capturing device receives the polling signal from the communicable device search unit in the RF ID reader writer of the TV the second power supply unit is supplied with power to activate operate the RF ID unit Step S . Here at least the RF ID unit which can be operated under the second power supply unit is activated. It is not necessary to activate all functions in the image capturing device .

When the activation of the RF ID unit of the image capturing device is completed at Step S the image capturing device transmits a polling response for the polling to the RF ID reader writer of the TV via the second antenna Step S .

After the image capturing device responds to the polling at Step S the TV receives the polling response by the wireless antenna of the RF ID reader writer Step S .

After receiving the polling response at Step S the TV determines whether or not the image capturing device transmitting the polling response is a device mutually communicable with the TV Step S . If the determination is made that the image capturing device cannot mutually communicate with the TV then the processing is completed. On the other hand if the determination is made that the image capturing device is mutually communicable with the TV then the processing proceeds to Step S.

If the determination is made that the image capturing device is mutually communicable with the TV at Step S then the TV performs mutual authentication to determine whether or not the image capturing device and the TV are legitimate devices for communication Step S . The mutual authentication is the same as general mutual authentication using HDMI or IEEE1394. In the mutual authentication issuing of challenge data and checking of response data are performed plural times between the TV and the image capturing device to eventually generate a common cryptography key. If one of the TV and the image capturing device is not legitimate the common cryptography key is not generated thereby disabling future mutual communication.

The image capturing device also performs the same mutual authentication in the RF ID unit . Generation and transmission of challenge data and receiving and checking of response data are performed plural times between the TV and the image capturing device to eventually generate a cryptography key identical to the cryptography key generated by the TV Step S .

When the mutual authentication is completed at Step S the image capturing device reads the server URL generation information as the server specific information from the second memory then encrypts the server URL generation information using the common cryptography key generated at the mutual authentication and transmits the encrypted server URL generation information to the RF ID reader writer of the TV Step S .

The TV receives the encrypted server URL generation information transmitted at Step S by the receiving unit in the RF ID reader writer . Then the decryption unit decrypts the encrypted server URL generation information using the common cryptography key. Based on the server URL generation information the URL generation unit generates a URL to access the server . Then the TV transmits to the image capturing device a notification of completion of receiving the server URL generation information Step S .

After the notification of the receiving completion is transmitted at Step S the image capturing device receives the notification by the second antenna . Then the image capturing device reads the captured image state information from the second memory to transmit the captured image state information to the TV Step S . The captured image state information is the final capturing time case the existence identifiers which are existence identification information regarding images not yet uploaded and each of which is assigned to a corresponding one of the captured images so that it is possible to determine whether the image has not yet been uploaded case the not yet uploaded image information hashed information case or the final image serial number from among image serial numbers chronologically assigned to captured images case . The captured image state information is important for examining synchronization between captured images in the image capturing device and captured images in the server .

After the image capturing device transmits the captured image state information at Step S the TV receives the captured image state information by the RF ID reader writer and then transmits to the image capturing device a notification of completion of receiving the captured image state information Step S . Here the CPU in the TV performs the following processing depending on kinds of the received captured image state information .

In case the final capturing time is used as the captured image state information . Therefore the TV compares the final capturing time to the final upload time that is a time of finally uploading to the server . If the final capturing time is temporally later than the final upload time then it is determined that the image data in the image capturing device is not in synchronization with the image data in the server . Therefore warning information regarding the synchronization failure is displayed on the display unit of the TV .

In case the captured image state information is the existence identifiers each of which is assigned to a corresponding one of the captured images so that it is possible to determine whether the image has not yet been uploaded. Therefore the TV examines the existence identifiers to determine whether or not there is any image not yet uploaded. If there is any image not yet uploaded then it is determined that the image data in the image capturing device is not in synchronization with the image data in the server . Therefore warning information regarding the synchronization failure is displayed on the display unit of the TV .

In case the not yet uploaded image information hashed information is employed as the captured image state information . Therefore the TV examines the not yet uploaded image information hashed information to determine whether or not there is any image not yet uploaded. If there is any image not yet uploaded then it is determined that the image data in the image capturing device is not in synchronization with the image data in the server . Therefore warning information regarding the synchronization failure is displayed on the display unit of the TV .

In case the captured image state information is the final image serial number from among image serial numbers chronologically assigned to the captured images. Therefore the TV compares a the final image serial number from among image serial numbers chronologically assigned to the captured images to b an image serial number of an image finally uploaded to the server . Here the final image serial number is provided from the image capturing device while the image serial number is provided from the server . Based on the comparison the TV can determine whether or not there is any image not yet uploaded. If there is any image not yet uploaded then it is determined that the image data in the image capturing device is not in synchronization with the image data in the server . Therefore warning information regarding the synchronization failure is displayed on the display unit of the TV .

After the TV completes receiving of the captured image state information and transmits the notification of the receipt to the image capturing device at Step S the image capturing device reads the image display method instruction information from the second memory and transmits the image display method instruction information to the TV Step S . The image display method instruction information includes the list display flag and the slide show display flag .

After the image display method instruction information is transmitted at Step S the TV receives the image display method instruction information by the RF ID reader writer of the TV and transmits a notification of completion of receiving the image display method instruction information to the image capturing device Step S . The data processing unit of the TV generates a mode of displaying images downloaded from the server based on the received image display method instruction information . For example if the list display flag in the image display method instruction information is ON the data processing unit generates a list of the downloaded images and stores the generated list in the memory unit and causes the display unit to display the list. On the other hand if the slide show flag in the image display method instruction information is ON the data processing unit generates a slide show of the downloaded images and stores the generated slide show in the memory unit and causes the display unit to display the slide show.

After receiving the image display method instruction information at Step S the TV disconnects communication from the RF ID unit of the image capturing device Step S .

Next the TV activates a TV system Step S . The activation of the TV system refers to turning the main power of the TV N to display the downloaded image data on the display unit . Prior to the activation of the TV system at Step S at least the RF ID reader writer of the TV is activated and the display unit may be turned OFF.

Then the communication unit is activated to connect the TV to the server based on the URL generated by the URL generation unit Step S .

After connecting to the server at Step S the TV downloads uploaded image data from the server Step S .

The data processing unit generates to be displayed image data from the images downloaded at the Step S based on the image display method instruction information obtained from the camera the image capturing device then stores the generated image data into the memory unit and displays the image data on the display unit Step S . The data processing unit of the TV generates a mode of displaying the images image data downloaded from the server based on the received image display method instruction information . For example if the list display flag in the image display method instruction information is ON the data processing unit generates a list of the downloaded images and stores the generated list in the memory unit and causes the display unit to display the list. On the other hand if the slide show display flag in the image display method instruction information is ON the data processing unit generates a slide show of the downloaded images and stores the generated slide show in the memory unit and causes the display unit to display the slide show.

After displaying of the images downloaded from the server is completed at Step S the TV performs synchronization examination to determine whether or not the captured images recorded in the third memory of the image capturing device are in synchronization with the images downloaded from the server Step S . The synchronization examination is performed based on the captured image state information provided at Step S from the image capturing device . The captured image state information is the final capturing time case the existence identifiers which are existence identification information regarding images not yet uploaded and each of which is assigned to a corresponding one of the captured images so that it is possible to determine whether the image has not yet been uploaded case the not yet uploaded image information hashed information case or the final image serial number from among image serial numbers chronologically assigned to captured images case . The captured image state information is important for examining synchronization between captured images in the image capturing device and captured images in the server .

First the communication unit of the receives from the server date time of finally uploading to the server hereinafter referred to also as a final upload date time that may be date time of capturing a final image among uploaded images to produce the same advantages Step S .

Next the TV compares the final upload date time to a final capturing date time Step S . The final capturing date time which is date time of final capturing of the image capturing device is indicated in the captured image state information provided from the image capturing device to the RF ID reader writer . If the final upload date time is prior to the final capturing date time it is determined that there is an image captured after the final upload and not yet uploaded to the server . Therefore a determination is made that the images in the image capturing device are not in synchronization with the images in the server . Then warning information is displayed at Step S. On the other hand if the final upload date time is equal to the final capturing date time it is determined that the images in the image capturing device are in synchronization with the images in the server . Then the synchronization examination is completed without displaying warning information.

If it is determined at Step S that the images in the image capturing device are not in synchronization with the images in the server the display unit displays warning information indicating the synchronization failure. Here if time information is generated by comparing the final upload date time to the final capturing date time in order to indicate from when captured images are not uploaded and the generated time information is presented as a message together with the warning information the warning information is convenient for the user.

Case relates to a flowchart when the captured image state information is the existence identifiers each of which is assigned to a corresponding one of the captured images so that it is possible to determine whether the image has not yet been uploaded.

First it is determined based on the existence identifiers of the not yet uploaded image existence identification information whether or not there is any image not yet uploaded to the server from among the captured images stored in the third memory of the image capturing device Step S . Here the existence identifiers are indicated in the captured image state information provided from the image capturing device to the RF ID reader writer . If it is determined that there is an image not yet uploaded to the server at Step S then the processing proceed to Step S to display warning information. On the other hand if there is not image not yet uploaded it is determined that the images in the image capturing device are in synchronization with the images in the server . Then the synchronization examination is completed without displaying warning information.

If it is determined that the images in the image capturing device are not in synchronization with the images in the server the display unit displays warning information indicating the synchronization failure at Step S.

Case relates to a flowchart when the captured image state information is the not yet uploaded image information hashed information .

First it is determined based on the not yet uploaded image information hashed information whether or not there is any image not yet uploaded to the server from among the captured images stored in the third memory of the image capturing device Step S . Here the not yet uploaded image information hashed information is indicated in the captured image state information provided from the image capturing device to the RF ID reader writer . The determination of Step S is performed by comparing the not yet uploaded image information hashed information to a hashed value generated by hashing NULL generated in the TV . If it is determined that there is an image not yet uploaded at Step S then the processing proceed to Step S to display warning information. On the other hand if there is no image not yet uploaded it is determined that the images in the image capturing device are in synchronization with the images in the server . Then the synchronization examination is completed without displaying warning information.

If it is determined that the images in the image capturing device are not in synchronization with the images in the server the display unit displays warning information indicating the synchronization failure at Step S.

Case relates to a flowchart when the captured image state information is a final image serial number from among image serial numbers assigned to captured images.

First the communication unit of the TV receives from the server an image serial number of an image finally uploaded to the server Step S .

Next the TV compares a the image serial number of the image finally uploaded which is provided form the server to b a final image serial number of an image finally captured which is indicated in the captured image state information provided from the image capturing device by the RF ID reader writer Step S . If the mage serial number of the image finally uploaded is smaller than the mage serial number of the image finally captured it is determined that there is an image captured after the final upload and not yet uploaded to the server . Therefore a determination is made that the images in the image capturing device are not in synchronization with the images in the server . Then the processing proceeds to Step S to display warning information. On the other hand if the mage serial number of the image finally uploaded is identical to the mage serial number of the image finally captured it is determined that the images in the image capturing device are in synchronization with the images in the server . Then the synchronization examination is completed without displaying warning information.

If it is determined at Step S that the images in the image capturing device are not in synchronization with the images in the server the display unit displays warning information indicating the synchronization failure.

When all of images captured by the image capturing device are not uploaded to the serve in other words when images captured by the image capturing device are not in synchronization with images uploaded to the server any of above cases to makes it possible to detect the synchronization failure. Thereby although all of the captured images cannot be displayed on the display unit a convenient message can be displayed to the user to inform the synchronization failure. As a result unnecessary confusion of the user can be prevented.

First 1 a data format in uploading captured images from the image capturing device to the server is described. The data format includes camera ID a sever address a server login ID a server login password an image directory and an uploading image number .

The camera ID is camera UID uniquely assigned to each camera image capturing device . The camera ID is ID information recorded in the camera ID in the second memory of the image capturing device . Use of the camera ID as login ID to the server can provide a server address unique to each image capturing device so that the image capturing device can access the server without user s entry of login ID. In addition the camera ID enables the server to manage captured images for each capturing camera.

The sever address is included in the server address information in the server specific information stored in the second memory of the image capturing device . The sever address enables the TV to identify the server to which target image data is uploaded.

The server login ID is included in the login ID in the user identification information in the server specific information stored in the second memory of the image capturing device . The server login ID allows the TV to login by using the same account to the server to which the image capturing device uploads image data.

The server login password is included in the password in the server specific information stored in the second memory of the image capturing device . The server login password allows the TV to login by using the same account to the server to which the image capturing device uploads image data.

The uploading image number is the number of images to be uploaded to the server. The uploading image number is equal to the number of images which is stored as the not yet uploaded image number in the second memory of the image capturing device . After capturing images the number of images not yet uploaded is indicated in the uploading image number .

After transmitting the data format the image capturing device uploads to the server the images that are stored in the third memory of the image capturing device but have not yet been uploaded to the server .

Next 2 a data format used in RF ID communication between the image capturing device and the TV is described. The data format includes camera ID a sever address a server login ID a server login password a final capturing date time final capturing time and not yet uploaded image data existence identifiers not yet uploaded image information hashed information a final image serial number and image display method instruction information .

The camera ID is a camera UID uniquely assigned to each camera image capturing device . The camera ID is ID information recorded in the camera ID in the second memory of the image capturing device . Use of the camera ID as login ID to the server from the TV can provide a server address unique to each image capturing device so that the TV can access the server without user s entry of login ID. The camera ID may be used in the mutual authentication between the RF ID unit of the image capturing device and the RF ID reader writer of the TV .

The sever address is included in the server address information in the server specific information stored in the second memory of the image capturing device . The sever address enables the TV to identify the server to which target image data is uploaded.

The server login ID is included in the login ID in the user identification information in the server specific information stored in the second memory of the image capturing device . The server login ID allows the TV to login by using the same account to the server to which the image capturing device uploads image data.

The server login password is included in the password in the server specific information stored in the second memory of the image capturing device . The server login password allows the TV to login by using the same account to the server to which the image capturing device uploads image data.

The final capturing date time corresponds to the final capturing time in the captured image state information stored in the second memory of the image capturing device . The TV uses the final capturing date time for the synchronization examination between captured images in the image capturing device and captured images in the server .

The not yet uploaded image data existence identifiers correspond to the not yet uploaded image data existence identification information in the captured image state information stored in the second memory of the image capturing device . TV uses the not yet uploaded image data existence identifiers for the synchronization examination between captured images in the image capturing device and captured images in the server . In order to implement each of the not yet uploaded image data existence identifiers each image ID for identifying a corresponding one of captured images is assigned with an upload flag indicating whether or not the corresponding image has been uploaded to the server . Thereby it is possible to determine whether or not each of the captured images has been uploaded to the server .

The not yet uploaded image information hashed information corresponds to the not yet uploaded image information hashed information in the captured image state information stored in the second memory of the image capturing device . The TV uses the not yet uploaded image information hashed information for the synchronization examination between captured images in the image capturing device and captured images in the server .

The final image serial number corresponds to the final image serial number in the captured image state information stored in the second memory of the image capturing device . The TV uses the final image serial number for the synchronization examination between captured images in the image capturing device and captured images in the server .

The image display method instruction information corresponds to the image display method instruction information in the captured image state information stored in the second memory of the image capturing device . The image display method instruction information includes identification information by which the TV designates a method of viewing images downloaded from the server .

For each image ID the image display method instruction information includes a list display flag a slide show flag a print flag a video reproduction flag a download flag and a security password .

The image ID is information unique to a captured image. The pieces of image ID are chronologically assigned to captured images by the image capturing device in capturing the images.

The list display flag corresponds to the list display flag stored in the second memory of the image capturing device . The TV uses the list display flag to determine whether or not image data downloaded from the server is to be displayed in a list format. If the list display flag indicates yes the data processing unit of the TV generates a list of the downloaded images stores the list to the memory unit and then displays the list on the display unit .

The slide show flag corresponds to the slide show flag stored in the second memory of the image capturing device . The TV uses the slide show flag to determine whether or not image data downloaded from the server is to be displayed as a slide show. If the slide show flag indicates automatic the data processing unit of the TV generates a slide show of the downloaded images stores the slide show to the memory unit and then displays the slide show on the display unit . If the slide show flag indicates manual the TV permits execution of the slide show according to instructions from the user. If the slide show flag indicates disable the TV inhibits display of the slide show.

The print flag indicates whether or not images to be downloaded to the TV and then displayed on the display unit are permitted to be printed by a printer not shown connected to the TV . The print flag is not shown in the image display method instruction information stored in the second memory of the image capturing device . However if the print flag is added it is possible to set whether or not image data is printable. As a result usability related to use of images can be improved.

The video reproduction flag indicates whether or not video data captured by the image capturing device and then uploaded to the server is permitted to be downloaded by the TV and then viewed. If the image capturing device has a video capturing function addition of the video reproduction flag to the image display method instruction information stored in the second memory can add setting of whether or not video reproduction is permitted. As a result the video reproduction can be managed without complicated operations by the user.

The download flag is an identifier indicating whether or not image or video uploaded to the server is permitted to be downloaded copied to a memory in the TV . The download flag can prevent that the image or video is copied by the third person to which image capturing is not permitted. Thereby copy right protection is also achieved.

The security password is password information that permits only the authorized user to perform the above described image viewing printing and downloading processes. In Embodiment A2 the same password is set for each of the above described image viewing printing and downloading processes. It is preferable however to set a different password to each of image viewing printing and downloading processes so that a level of security can be set independently.

As described above in the system according to Embodiment A2 of the present invention the image capturing device uploads captured images to the server connected to the image capturing device via the first antenna. When the image capturing device is prevented to the RF ID reader writer of the TV the image capturing device transmits the server URL generation information the captured image state information and the image display method instruction information from the RF ID unit to the TV by the RF ID communication. Then the TV connects to the server to which the image capturing device has uploaded the captured images then downloads the captured images from the server and displays the captured images. Here it is determined whether or not the captured images in the server are in synchronization with the captured images in the image capturing device . If the synchronization is failure the TV displays notification of the synchronization failure on the display unit . Thereby the user can display the captured images only by presenting the image capturing device to the TV although the user conventionally has to remove a recording memory from the camera the image capturing device to be equipped to the TV in order to view the images. Thereby even the user who is not familiar with operations of digital devices can easily display the images on the TV .

The electronic catalog display system according to Embodiment A3 includes an electronic catalog server information input device an electronic catalog notification card the TV and an electronic catalog server . The electronic catalog server information input device includes a RF ID writer . The electronic catalog notification card includes a RF ID unit . The TV includes a RF ID reader and a network communication unit . The electronic catalog server includes an electronic catalog database and a customer attribute database .

The electronic catalog server information input device writes electronic catalog server information from the RF ID writer to the RF ID unit attached to the electronic catalog notification card . The electronic catalog server information is provided from a user who provides services of an electronic catalog hereinafter referred to as a provider user . When a user who receives the services of the electronic catalog hereinafter referred to as a customer user brings the electronic catalog notification card in which the electronic catalog server information is written into proximity of the TV the RF ID reader in the TV reads the electronic catalog server information from the RF ID unit . In addition the TV transmits based on the readout electronic catalog server information a request for obtaining an electronic catalog to the electronic catalog server set on a network via the network communication unit communication unit . Furthermore when transmitting the request to the electronic catalog server the TV transmits also user information which is previously inputted in the TV to the electronic catalog server . The electronic catalog server receives the request for the electronic catalog and the user information from the TV . First the electronic catalog server obtains customer attribute data from the customer attribute database based on the user information. Next from the electronic catalog database the electronic catalog server obtains electronic catalog data associated with the customer attribute data. Then the electronic catalog server transmits the obtained electronic catalog data to the TV from which the request for the electronic catalog has been transmitted. The TV displays the electronic catalog data received from the electronic catalog server and thereby receives purchase operations from the customer user to purchase products in the electronic catalog data.

The following describes the electronic catalog display system according to Embodiment A3 in more detail.

First a key input receiving unit receives an input by input keys operated by the provider user in order to obtain the electronic catalog server information. The electronic catalog server information obtained by the key input receiving unit includes a sever address such as a URL server login ID a server login password an electronic catalog display password electronic catalog display information and a medium identification information. The electronic catalog display information indicates whether images of products services in the electronic catalog are to be displayed in a list as thumbnails or sequentially as a slide show . The medium identification information is used for identifying a medium such as a card or a postcard to which RF ID is attached. The electronic catalog server information obtained by the key input receiving unit is stored into a storage unit . Next when a RF ID transmission key and the like are received after receiving of the electronic catalog server information a RF ID transmission input receiving unit notifies a transmission unit of a transmission request. Then the transmission unit reads the electronic catalog server information from the storage unit . An antenna unit transmits the electronic catalog server information.

The processing performed by the electronic catalog server information input device is presented in more detail with reference to a flowchart of .

A structure and processing of the RF ID unit are the same as those described in Embodiments A1 and A2. The second power supply unit obtains current from signals received by the second antenna and provides power to each unit in the electronic catalog notification card . Received information is recorded into the second memory via the data receiving unit the second processing unit and the recording unit .

The structure of the TV according to Embodiment A3 differs from the structure of the TV according to Embodiment A2 in that a user information input unit is added. The user information input unit receives the user information and stores the user information into a memory unit temporarily. The user information is an attribute of the customer user and previously inputted by the customer user himself herself. The user information is preferably gender or age information of the customer user. The user information may be other information such as a residence or a family structure which is private information for selecting product service data in the electronic catalog. The user information is transmitted to the electronic catalog server via the communication unit together with the URL of the electronic catalog server generated by the URL generation unit. In the same manner as described in Embodiment A1 in Embodiment A3 when the customer user moves the electronic catalog notification card into proximity of a RF ID reader of the TV the TV receives the electronic catalog server information and thereby generates a URL of the server to connect to the server. The details of this processing are the same as those described in Embodiment A1 with reference to .

The electronic catalog server receives an electronic catalog destination address and the user information from the TV via a communication unit . The electronic catalog destination address is a network address of the TV on a network to which the TV and the electronic catalog server belong. Next based on the user information received by the customer attribute data obtainment unit the electronic catalog server obtains customer attribute data from the customer attribute database . For instance if the user information includes a gender and an age of the customer user using the TV the electronic catalog server obtains as the customer attribute data information of a product service genre and a product service price range which are in association with the age and gender of the customer user based on the customer attribute database having a data structure illustrated in . Then the electronic catalog data obtainment unit obtains the electronic catalog data from the electronic catalog database based on customer attribute data. For example if the customer attribute data includes product service genres and product service price ranges the electronic catalog server obtains as the electronic catalog data all of product service data corresponding to the product service genres and the product service price ranges from the electronic catalog database having a data structure illustrated in . The electronic catalog server transmits the electronic catalog data obtained by the electronic catalog data obtainment unit to the TV having the electronic catalog destination address via a communication unit . The processing performed by the electronic catalog server is presented in more detail in a flowchart of .

The following describes processing of the TV after downloading the electronic catalog data with reference to a flowchart of . The processing regarding obtaining of the electronic catalog server information from the RF ID unit at Steps S to S is the same whichever the electronic catalog data is downloaded or not. At S it is determined whether or not the electronic catalog data associated with the electronic catalog server information received from the RF ID unit has already been downloaded and displayed. If the electronic catalog data has not yet been downloaded then the TV downloads the electronic catalog data from the server at S and displays the electronic catalog data at S. The download processing is the same as the download processing described in Embodiment A1.

If it is determined at S that the electronic catalog data has already been downloaded then the TV issues a signal of a predetermined key for example a signal of a Decide key to execute operations for the displayed electronic catalog data. Here as illustrated in an example of a screen display of the electronic catalog data in a screen presents the customer user with a few of options for a next operation to be executed by the customer user for the displayed electronic catalog data. Then a focus circulates among the options on the screen as illustrated as options and in to indicate one of them as a selection candidate every time a predetermined time period passes. This allows the customer user to execute an operation for selecting or purchasing each product in the electronic catalog data for example only by presenting the electronic catalog notification card having the RF ID unit to the TV when the focus indicates a desired option of the customer user.

The second memory according to Embodiment A3 which is embedded in the RF ID unit on the electronic catalog notification card may be a Read Only Memory ROM . In this aspect the electronic catalog server information input device serves as a RF ID memory data input unit in manufacturing the RF ID unit or a RF ID memory data input means in a RF ID manufacturing system. In general a RF ID unit having a ROM unit is inexpensive more than a RF ID unit having a rewritable memory. Therefore the RF ID unit having a ROM allows the provider user sending a great number of electronic catalog notification cards to reduce a cost.

It should be noted that it has been described in Embodiment A3 that a focus circulates among the options on the screen of the TV as illustrated as options and in to indicate one of them as a selection candidate every time a predetermined time period passes. However the method of operating the electronic catalog data displayed on the screen by using the electronic catalog notification card having the RF ID unit is not limited to the above. For example it is also possible that the receiving unit of the TV sequentially receive pieces of information from the RF ID unit and counts the sequential receiving processes then thereby calculates a time period RF ID proximity time period during which the RF ID unit is in proximity of the TV and eventually moves a focus indicating a selection candidate displayed on the screen based on the RF ID proximity time period. With the above structure the following operation for the electronic catalog is possible. Only when the RF ID unit is in proximity of the TV the focus displayed on the screen is circulated to change the selection candidate. If the RF ID unit is away from the TV the focus is stopped. After a predetermined time period after stopping of the focus the selection candidate on which the focus is stopped is decided as selection. In this operation for the electronic catalog the customer user can actively operate the electronic catalog by using the RF ID unit without waiting for the focus which automatically circulates among options every predetermined time period to arrive at a user s desired option.

It should also be noted that it has been described in Embodiment A3 that the electronic catalog server information input device has the key input receiving unit which receives inputs by the input keys operated by the provider user in order to obtain the electronic catalog server information. However the following configuration is also possible. That is the electronic catalog server information input device has a communication interface to communicate with the image server. The image server holds the server information to be transmitted to the electronic catalog server information input device . The electronic catalog server information input device receives the server information from the image server in order to obtain the server information. This configuration in which the server information is stored in the image server allows the electronic catalog server information input device to eliminate inputting to the image server. Especially when a plurality of the electronic catalog server information input devices are operated for a single image server this configuration is highly convenient.

The conventional techniques have a program that users who are not familiar with operations of digital devices such as personal computers should learn operations of the devices to do online shopping. However the system according to Embodiment A3 enables users using electronic catalogs to do online shopping and the like simply by bringing received cards or post cards into proximity of TVs. Therefore even users who are not familiar with online terminals such as personal computers and mobile phones can easily enjoy shopping on TV screens.

In Embodiment A4 it is described a method of sending to a remote location a post card attached with RF ID used to access an image server. First a first user who is a sender of a post card brings the image capturing device having the RF ID unit into proximity of the RF ID reader writer of the TV . Thereby the TV generates a server URL used to connect the TV to the image server thereby obtains image data from the image server and eventually displays the image data on a screen. This processing is the same as described in Embodiment A1. Next by using an input means such as a remote controller of the TV the first user selects an image s to be printed on a post card and images to be registered in association with the post card in other words images to be shown to a second user living in a remote location from among the image data displayed by the TV . In addition the first user inputs address information such as a destination address of the post card by using the remote controller or the like. The TV transmits to the image server ID of the image selected by the first user to be printed on the post card hereinafter referred to as print image ID ID of the images to be registered for the post card hereinafter referred to as registration image ID and the destination information of the post card hereinafter referred to as post card destination information . The image server retrieves the image data identified by the print image ID and then transmits the image data and the post card destination information to a printer . The printer prints the image data and the post card destination information on the post card. In addition to the image server information input unit the image server transmits the registration image ID received from the TV together with image server information. The image server information includes a sever address such as a URL server login ID a server login password an image display password image display information indicating whether the image data images is to be displayed in a list as thumbnails or sequentially as a slide show and medium identification information indicating a medium such as a card or post card to which RF ID is to be attached. An image server information input device writes the image server information and the registration image ID to the RF ID unit of the post card on which the image and the destination information are printed by the printer . The post card applied with printing and RF ID writing is mailed to the printed destination. Thereby the second user who is designated by the first user as being the destination receives the post card . When the second user brings the mailed post card into proximity of a RF ID reader writer of a TV of the second user the TV of the second user obtains the image server information and the registration image ID from the RF ID unit downloads the images identified by the registration image ID and displays the downloaded images.

The structure and processing of the image capturing device according to Embodiment A4 are the same as described in Embodiment A1.

A receiving unit receives the image server information from the RF ID unit of the image capturing device or the post card via a wireless antenna . If the RF ID unit of the post card holds the registration image ID the receiving unit receives also the registration image ID. An image selection unit receives an image selection operation from the user via a key unit and an infrared ray receiving unit and thereby obtains ID of an image which the first user has selected to be printed on the post card namely the print image ID and ID of images which the first user has selected to be registered for the post card namely the registration image ID . Then the image selection unit provides the obtained IDs to the communication unit .

When the post card is applied with printing and RF ID writing the post card is mailed to the printed destination. The second user who is designated by the first user as being the destination receives the post card . When the second user presents the received post card to the TV the receiving unit receives the image server information and the registration image ID from the RF ID unit via the wireless antenna . A decryption unit decrypts encrypted information in the image server information and the registration image ID. Next the URL generation unit generates a URL from which only images identified by the registration image ID from among images stored in the image server are downloaded to the TV . More specifically the URL generation unit may designate an internal directory of the server in the generated URL or may use a method of embedding the registration image ID to the URL as a URL option. By using the URL generated by the URL generation unit to designate the server the TV accesses the image server to obtain the images which is the same as described in more detail in Embodiment A1.

It should be noted that it has been described in Embodiment A4 that the user inputs the destination information to the TV but the user may input not only the destination information such as an address and a name but also a message to be printed with an image on a post card. The TV receives the input message together with the destination information and provides them to the image server . The printer prints them on the post card. in illustrates an example of a screen of the TV on which a message to be printed is inputted. If the user can select an image to be printed on the post card and also input an message added to the image a flexibility in generating a post card with RF ID is increased.

It should also be noted that the TV according to Embodiment A4 may allow the user to perform operations for images displayed on the TV by using the post card with RF ID in the same manner as described in Embodiment A3 for the processing in which the user operates an electronic catalog displayed on a screen by using RF ID.

As described above the system according to Embodiment A4 enables the user to mail a post card with RF ID to a person living in a distant location without creating a post card attached with RF ID by the user himself herself. In addition when the user wishes to print the image s stored in the image server onto the post card to be mailed the system allows the user to perform operation on a TV screen to select an image s to be printed. As a result high usability is achieved.

Conventionally if the user intends to show images on a large screen display device to a different user living in a remote location the user in the remote location needs to learn operations of the device apparatus an operation acquirer has to go to the remote location to operate the device or the display device in the remote location should be remotely controlled. The system according to Embodiment A4 however enables such a user in a remote location to easily view images by a simple operation for example by bringing a physical medium such as a post card with RF ID into proximity of a display device.

Embodiment A5 of the present invention has the following configuration. A mailing object such as a post card is written with fixed information. The image capturing device associates the fixed information with an image or a group of images image data stored in the server. A reproduction side reads the fixed information from the RF ID attached to the post card or the like in order to display the image data associated with the fixed information. The configuration is illustrated in . Referring to first the image capturing device reads the fixed information from the mailing object then associates the fixed information with an image s and registers information of the association hereinafter referred to as association information into the server. When the user receives the mailing object for which the registration is completed the user brings the mailing object into proximity of a RF ID reader of a TV to read the fixed information from the mailing object. The TV queries the server using the fixed information and thereby displays the image s associated with the mailing object.

Embodiment A5 is characterized in that the RF ID information in the mailing object is not rewritable ROM or in non rewritable environments so that image data in the server is associated with the mailing object without rewriting the fixed information in the mailing object.

The images captured by the image capturing device are uploaded to the server using the method described in the prior embodiments. Here an identifier is assigned to an uploaded image or image group. The identifier makes it possible to identify the image or an group of images stored in the server.

The following describes a method of associating i an image or image group which is captured and uploaded to the server by the image capturing device with ii fixed information recorded in a RF ID tag of a mailing object. illustrates examples of the fixed information recorded in the RF ID tag of the mailing object. a in illustrates fixed information including mailing object UID unique to the mailing object and information such as an address for accessing the image server. b in illustrates fixed information including the mailing object UID and information such as an address for accessing a relay server. c in illustrates fixed information including the mailing object UID only. The fixed information may also include a login ID password information and the like for accessing the server. It is assumed in Embodiment A5 that such information necessary to access the server is included in a URL including the address information.

First the image capturing device reads information from the RF ID of the mailing object by using the RF ID reader S . In more detail the second antenna illustrated in communicates with the RF ID of the mailing object and thereby the data receiving unit receives the fixed information from mailing object. Then the second processing unit performs processing to provide the fixed information of the mailing object to the first processing unit via the recording unit the second memory and the recording reproducing unit . The first processing unit associates the mailing object UID read from the mailing object with an image or image group according to designation from the user S . Then the image capturing device accesses the server via the first antenna S . Thereby the image capturing device registers to the server the association information regarding the association between the mailing object UID and the image data stored in the server S .

If the fixed information read from the mailing object includes an address of the image server or a URL including the address then the processing is completed. On the other hand if the fixed information read from the mailing object does not include an address of the image server or a URL including the address the image capturing device sets a relay server .

In order to set a relay server the image capturing device accesses the relay server S . In more detail if the fixed information read from the mailing object includes an address of a relay server or a URL including the address then the image capturing device accesses the relay server. Otherwise the image capturing device accesses a relay server that is previously set for the image capturing device.

After accessing the relay server the image capturing device sets in a database of the relay server association information regarding association between the mailing object UID and the server that is a redirection destination transfer destination S . Thereby association between the mailing object UID and an address of the transfer destination is registered in the database of the relay server.

If the image capturing device does not have a RF ID reader function and the mailing object is printed with a two dimensional code or the like indicating information of the RF ID reader the image capturing device captures an image of the two dimensional code using an image capturing unit to read information from the code so that the image capturing device can obtain the same information as the fixed information recorded in the RF ID unit of the mailing object. The two dimensional code may be a QR Code a PDF417 Veri Code Maxi Code or the like. Any other code can be used if the image capturing device can read information from the code by capturing an image of the code. In addition the same advantages as described in Embodiment A5 can be produced by using a bar code in a one dimensional direction only although a printing area is increased.

A flow of processing data when the two dimensional code is read by the image capturing device is described with reference to the block diagram of . The two dimensional code printed on the mailing object is captured by the image capturing unit then converted into an imaged by the video processing unit and provided to the first processing unit via the recording reproducing unit . The first processing unit analyzes the captured two dimensional code and retrieves the information from the two dimensional code. The information indicated by the two dimensional code is basically the same as the information recorded in the RF ID unit. The information indicated by the two dimensional code includes at least the mailing object UID.

The following describes a flow of the processing from reading the information of the two dimensional code to associating the information with an image or image group in the server with reference to .

Firstly the image capturing unit captures an image of the two dimensional code S . Then it is determined whether or not the captured image is a two dimensional code S . If the captured image is not a two dimensional code then error processing is performed S . Or normal image capturing processing may be performed. On the other hand if the captured image is a two dimensional code then the two dimensional code is analyzed S . Thereby information is read from the mailing object based on the result of the analysis S . After reading the fixed information from the mailing object the image capturing device associates the mailing object UID with image data stored in the server S . Then the image capturing device accesses the server S . Then the image capturing device sets the association information to the server S . The Steps S to S are the same as the Steps S to S in . Here if the readout information does not include an address of the image server or a URL including the address then the image capturing device performs transfer setting to a relay server. The transfer setting to the relay server has been previously described with reference to .

As described above by reading information from the two dimensional bar code printed on the mailing object it is possible to complete to associate the information recorded on the RF ID unit with image data stored in the server.

If the image capturing device does not have a RF ID reader function and the mailing object is not printed with a code such as a two dimensional code the image capturing device can read information from the mailing object if the user manually inputs to the image capturing device the mailing object UID and the URL such as a sever address which are printed on the mailing object. The user inputs the information using buttons to illustrated in . In this aspect the URL and the mailing object UID may be printed directly as a plane text or coded to be a code which the user easily inputs.

As described above even if the image capturing device does not have a RF ID reader function and the mailing object is not printed with a two dimensional code it is possible to associate the mailing object with image data stored in the server.

Next the steps for viewing images stored in the server on the TV using the mailing object for which association is completed.

When the user brings the mailing object into proximity of the RF ID reader of the TV the TV reads information of the RF ID on the mailing object S . Then a determination is made as to whether or not the readout information includes a sever address or a URL including the server address S . If the readout information includes a sever address or a URL including the sever address then the TV accesses the designated server S . Then the TV transmits the mailing object UID S . Then a determination is made as to whether or not the server receiving the transmission is a relay server S . If the server is a relay server then the relay server redirects to a server the image sever designated in the relay server S . Thereby the TV accesses an image or image group in the image server S . On the other hand if it is determined at S that the server receiving the transmission is the image server then redirecting is not performed and access to the image server is performed S . Moreover if it is determined at S that the readout information does not include a sever address then the TV accesses a server set by a predetermined default S . Then the TV transmits the mailing object UID to the default server S . The default server redirects to a server the image server designated in the default server S to access the image server.

Here if association between the mailing object UID and the designated server as a destination of the relay is not registered in a database of the relay or default server the relay or default server redirects to an error page.

When the relay or default server receives the mailing object UID S the server searches its database for information regarding the mailing object UID S . Then the relay or default server determines whether or not the database holds information regarding the mailing object UID S . If the database holds the information then the relay or default server redirects to a server associated with the mailing object UID in the database S . On the other hand if the database does not hold the information in other words if there is no association then the relay or default server redirects to an error page S .

As described above the mailing object having fixed information in the RF ID is previously associated with image data stored in the image server. Thereby when the mailing object with the association is presented to the TV the user can view an image or image group in the server which is associated with the mailing object UID without rewriting of the RF ID of the mailing object. Therefore even if the user is away from home and cannot rewrite the RF ID of the mailing object or even if the RF ID of the mailing object is not rewritable the user can associate images in the server with the mailing object. As a result the user allows a person receiving the mailing object to view the images associated with the mailing object.

It should be noted that it has been described in Embodiment A5 that the mailing object UID is transmitted after accessing the server. However it is also possible to generate a URL from the mailing object UID and the sever address recorded on the mailing object in order to access the server. In this aspect it is possible to perform the access to the server and the transmission of the mailing object UID at the same time.

According to Embodiment A5 even in an environment where the RF ID cannot be rewritten such as in a sight seeing location for example the user can associate captured images with a post card and send the post card to a friend. Thereby the friend receiving the post card presents the post card to a TV to view the images the user captured in the sight seeing location. As explained above even in an environment where the RF ID cannot be rewritten the user can create a mailing object associated with images in the server and then send the mailing object to a person to which the user desires to show the images.

If the image capturing device has a RF ID writer function to rewrite the RF ID of the mailing object the processing is the same as processing performed by the TV for associating the mailing object with image data in the server which will be described below in Embodiment A6. Therefore the processing is not described in Embodiment A5.

In Embodiment A6 the following configuration is described. The image capturing device captures images and uploads the images to the image server. Then a user transmitting the images hereinafter referred to as a sending user selects an image group from the images in the server. Information for accessing the selected image group is recorded in the RF ID on the mailing object. The mailing object is mailed to a user receiving the images hereinafter referred to as a receiving user . The receiving user accesses the image group in the image server by using the RF ID on the mailing object.

Here the same reference numerals of are assigned to the identical elements of so that the identical elements are not explained again below.

In a mailing object is a post card envelope or letter paper which is mailed from the image transmission side to the image receiving side. A RF ID unit is a rewritable RF ID. At least part of the RF ID unit is a rewritable memory unit . The RF ID unit is attached to or incorporated into the mailing object in order to be sent to the image receiving side together with the mailing object.

As described in the prior embodiments the memory unit in the RF ID unit holds the medium identification information for identifying that the medium having the RF ID unit is a mailing object.

Referring to a TV is a TV display device provided in the image receiving side. The TV has the same function as that of the TV in described in the prior embodiments. Like the TV in the TV includes a RF ID reader writer corresponding to the RF ID reader writer in and a display unit corresponding to the display unit in . The TV is connected to the Internet via a network connection means not shown.

In the image transmission side in images captured by the image capturing device are transmitted to a wireless access point via the first antenna in the image capturing device used for wireless communication such as a wireless LAN or WiMAX. The images are recorded as the image data onto the image server via the internet . Then the image capturing device is moved into proximity of the RF ID reader writer of the TV in order to establish connection with the TV by wireless communication via the second antenna of the image capturing device used for RF ID. The TV obtains from the image capturing device information for accessing the image data in the image server . Then the TV downloads the images of the image data to be displayed on the display unit . The above processing is the same as described in the prior embodiments. The above is just a summary.

Next the sending user checks the images displayed on the display unit of the TV in order to set transmission image selection information indicating whether or not each of the images is to be transmitted to the receiving user in other words whether or not each of the images is to be permitted to be viewed by the receiving user . The sending user can set also restriction on display for the receiving user utility form information such as a slide show and printing which is described in the prior embodiments. The transmission image selection information and the utility form information are transmitted to and recorded onto the image server. The image server manages as an image group a set of images selected as transmission images in the transmission image selection information.

The following describes steps performed by the TV for recording onto the mailing object information regarding the image group selected by the sending use with reference to a flowchart of .

It is assumed that transmission images have been selected and an image group set with the utility form information has been generated. Under the assumption the sending user brings the mailing object having the RF ID unit into proximity of the RF ID reader writer of the TV in order to establish wireless communication between the RF ID unit and the RF ID reader writer .

When the TV becomes able to communicate with the RF ID unit on the mailing object via the RF ID reader writer the TV reads information from the memory unit S . Then the TV determines whether or not the medium identification information indicates that the current communication partner is a mailing object S . If the current communication partner is a mailing object then the TV proceeds to steps for writing to the mailing object. Here if it is determined at Step S that the current communication partner is not a mailing object then the subsequent steps are not described here but the TV proceeds to steps depending on a medium indicated by the medium identification information.

In order to write to the mailing object first the TV accesses the image server via the internet S . Thereby the TV obtains from the image server image group designation information such as a server URL and an image group address for allowing the image receiving side to access the image group in the image server S .

The TV transmits the obtained image group designation information to the RF ID unit on the mailing object via the RF ID reader writer of the TV in order to write the image group designation information to the memory unit in the mailing object and the RF ID unit on the mailing object records the image group designation information to a rewritable region of the memory unit S .

As described above the mailing object on which the image group designation information is recorded is mailed by the sending user to a user of the image receiving side.

Next the image receiving side is described with reference to illustrating the schematic block diagram of the image receiving side and illustrating a flowchart of processing performed by the TV in the image receiving side.

Referring to the receiving user receives the mailing object from the sending user. Then the receiving user checks the RF ID unit or characters or design indicated on the mailing object to determine whether the mailing object is incorporated with a means for accessing images. Here the receiving user needs only to understand that the receiving user can access to the images by using the mailing object . The receiving user does not need to care about the image group designation information and the like in the RF ID unit .

In order to reproduce and view the images the receiving user brings the mailing object into proximity of the RF ID reader writer of the TV in the image receiving side so as to start viewing of the images.

If the RF ID unit on the mailing object is in enough proximity of the RF ID reader writer of the TV the RF ID reader writer supplies power to the RF ID unit of the mailing object via antennas not shown of both the RF ID reader writer and the RF ID unit in order to activate the RF ID unit . Thereby wireless communication between the TV and the RF ID unit of the mailing object starts. When the wireless communication starts the TV reads information from the memory unit of the RF ID unit S .

A determination is made as to whether or not the medium identification information in the readout information indicates that the current communication partner is a mailing object S . If the current communication partner is a mailing object then the TV proceeds to processing of reading the image group designated by the sending user from the image server .

The access to the image server makes it possible to generate an URL for accessing the image group in the image server by using the image group designation information in the information read by the RF ID unit at Step S such as an image group address and thereby to access the image server via the internet S .

The TV connected to the image server at the above step obtains the images the image group which are permitted to be displayed from among the image data in the image server based on the transmission image selection information indicating the image group managed by the image server S . Then the TV displays the images on the display unit S .

Furthermore according to the transmission image selection information indicating the image group managed by the image server and the utility form information the receiving user can use functions of for example reproducing the images as a slide show printing the images and downloading the images to a recording medium not shown attached to the TV or connected to the outside.

In addition for image printing the user can print the images by the printer on a LAN not shown and also ask via the Internet a photograph print service provider to print the images.

As described above with the above configuration according to Embodiment A6 of the present invention the image group designation information is provided from the RF ID unit on the mailing object to the TV in the image receiving side. Therefore the receiving user does not need to input characters of a network access destination to obtain images for example. In other words the intuitive and simple operation of simply bringing the mailing object into proximity of the TV enables the receiving user to access the image data stored in the image server . As a result the receiving user can obtain images from the image server without knowledge of complicated operations such as menu selection and character inputs.

It should be noted that it has been described in Embodiment A6 that the mailing object is previously attached or incorporated with the RF ID unit . However the mailing object may be a general post card or letter paper attached with an independent RF ID unit that is provided separately. In this aspect the above effect can be produced by later attaching the RF ID unit to the mailing object. This produces further advantages that the sending user can use Embodiment A6 for any desired mailing object.

It should also be noted that if the access to the image server requires a login operation a server login ID and a server login password may also be written at Step S into the rewritable region of the memory unit in the RF ID unit on the mailing object . Here it is desirable that the login ID and the login password are not plane texts but are written in an encrypted format for security.

It should also be noted that it has been described in Embodiment A6 that the TV in the image transmission side performs selection of transmission images setting of the utility form information and writing of the image group designation information to the RF ID unit on the mailing object . However it is also possible that the image capturing device having a RF ID reader writer function performs setting of the transmission image selection information and the utility form information and writing of the image group designation information in order to produce the same effect as described above for obtaining images by the simple operation of the receiving user.

Here the same step numerals of are assigned to the identical steps of so that the identical steps are not explained again below.

According to the variation of Embodiment A6 the mailing object UID is previously recorded on the memory unit of the RF ID unit on the mailing object . Here it is desirable to record the mailing object UID on a ROM region of the memory unit in order to reduce risks of data damages or data manipulation caused by accidental operations.

The TV in the image transmission side sets the transmission image selection information and the utility form information into the above described RF ID unit in order to designate an image group in the image serve . In this situation the TV performs processing according to the flowchart of a in .

The TV reads information from the RF ID unit on the mailing object S and determines based on the medium identification information that the communication partner is a mailing object S . After that the TV obtains the mailing object UID. The mailing object UID may be the information read at Step S or be newly obtained from the RF ID unit . Next the TV accesses the image server via the Internet S . The TV transmits the mailing object UID to the image server and thereby the image server associates with the transmitted mailing object UID with an address of the image group and then stores the manages information of the association association information S .

The TV obtains from the image server the server URL enabling the image receiving side to access the image server S . The obtained server URL is written into the rewritable region of the memory unit in the RF ID unit on the mailing object via the RF ID reader writer S .

As described above if the image server associates the image group with the mailing object UID and then stores and manages the association information the utility form information can be managed separately for each mailing object UID. Therefore in the situation where there are a plurality of the mailing objects it is possible to change an operation for receiving images for each mailing object namely for each different receiving user.

If in the configuration described in Embodiment A6 the image receiving side designates an image group for each mailing object generates a different image group address for each designated image group and writes the image group address into a corresponding RF ID unit the image transmission side needs complicated operations for designating image groups separately although the same advantages as those of Embodiment A6 can be obtained.

Therefore when the sending user selects the same transmission image group for a plurality of mailing objects it is preferable that the sending user records and manages different utility form information for each mailing object by using the mailing object UID as described earlier. Thereby it is possible to reduce operations of the sending user and to reduce a memory capacity of the image server because it is not necessary to hold pieces of the transmission image selection information separately thereby producing further advantages.

The processing of b in differs from the processing of a in in that Steps S and S are replaced by Steps S and . At Step the TV obtains an image group address in addition to the server URL. At Step S the TV writes the image group address together with the server URL into the memory unit of the RF ID unit .

Thereby when the image receiving side is to receive images the image receiving side accesses the designated image group in the image server . Here the access is permitted only when the mailing object UID of the image group stored and managed in the image server matches the mailing object UID used by the receiving server requesting the access. Thereby security is increased.

Conventionally if the user intends to show images on a large screen display device apparatus to a different user living in a remote location the user in the remote location needs to learn operations of the device an operation acquirer has to go to the remote location to operate the device or the display device in the remote location should be remotely controlled. However like Embodiment A4 the system according to Embodiment A6 enables such a user in a remote location to easily view images by a simple operation for example by bringing a physical medium such as a post card with RF ID into proximity of a display device. In Embodiment A4 generation of the post card with RF ID and writing of data into the RF ID is not performed by the user who captures and sends images or who views the images but by a service provider. In Embodiment A6 however the sending user in the image transmission side performs generation of the post card with RF ID and writing of data into the RF ID.

In Embodiment A7 of the present invention a method of changing setting for a device apparatus by using a RF ID card according to Embodiment A7 of the present invention is described.

The following describes a method of changing setting for a recorder by using a RF ID card with reference to .

A recorder records broadcast contents obtained by a tuner onto a Hard Disk Drive HDD or an optical disk drive . In addition the recorder reproduces on the TV the recorded contents or video audio contents read by the optical disk drive .

An input signal processing unit includes an Analog Digital A D converter a decoder and an encoder in order to convert input video audio signals into data in a predetermined video audio format. The A D converter converts analog signals obtained by the tuner into digital signals. The decoder decodes scrambled contents. The encoder converts data into data in a video format according to MPEG 2 for example.

An output signal processing unit includes a Digital Analog D A converter and a decoder in order to provide video and audio to the TV . The D A converter converts digital signals to analog signals. The decoder decodes data in a data format according to MPEG 2 for example.

A system control unit controls operations of the recorder . The system control unit includes a setting information processing unit that switches setting for the recorder . The setting information processing unit will be described in detail later.

An operation input unit receives inputs from a user using buttons of a remote controller a front panel or the like not shown .

The HDD has an area in which recorded contents and content lists provided from the input signal processing unit are stored.

The optical disk drive is a disk drive that performs recording or reproducing for an optical disk such as a Digital Versatile Disc DVD or a Blue ray Disc. The optical disk drive records recorded contents and content lists provided from the input signal processing unit onto the optical disc and reproduces video audio contents in the optical disk.

The input signal processing unit the output signal processing unit the system control unit the HDD and the optical disk drive of the recorder are connected one another via a bus .

According to the setting information stored in the memory the setting information processing unit sets displaying of a menu screen a recording reproducing mode chapters of recorded contents TV program recommendation based on user s preference and the like regarding the recorder . In more detail the setting information processing unit reads an identifier indicating for example menu screen background color Black from the setting information and thereby issues a request for menu screen display to the output signal processing unit together with an instruction for displaying a background of a menu screen in black.

Here the setting information may be stored in an external storage unit such as a SD card not shown. Especially it is efficient to store in the HDD the setting information regarding chapters of recorded contents stored in the HDD information having a large size and the like.

Conventionally the setting information has been set prior to purchase of the recorder or set by operations of the user using the operation input unit . In Embodiment A7 of the present invention however the setting information can be changed based on information obtained from the RF ID reader writer .

The RF ID card includes a memory the antenna the power supply unit second power supply unit the data receiving unit the data transfer unit a processing unit the recording unit and the reproducing unit .

When the RF ID card is moved to bring the antenna into proximity of the RF ID reader writer of the recorder the RF ID reader writer supplies power to the power supply unit via the antenna in order to provide power to the respective units in the RF ID card .

Information regarding data recording reproducing is read from the RF ID card to the recorder via the RF ID reader writer . In the recorder the information is received by the data receiving unit and then provided to the processing unit .

In the RF ID card the processing unit causes the recording unit to record information onto the memory and causes the reproducing unit to reproduce the information stored in the memory .

The data transfer unit transmits the information provided from the processing unit to the RF ID reader writer of the recorder via the antenna .

The memory in the RF ID card stores the UID the medium identification information and apparatus operation information .

The apparatus operation information holds pieces of information regarding an apparatus device to perform an operation using the RF ID card and regarding the operation. The following describes the pieces of information included in the apparatus operation information .

Operation apparatus identification information indicates a type of the apparatus device to perform the operation using the RF ID card . The operation apparatus identification information indicates the type by an identifier in the similar manner as described for the medium identification information . In the operation apparatus identification information holds an identifier indicating that a type of the apparatus to perform the operation is a recorder.

Target apparatus information holds information so that only a specific apparatus device can perform the operation using the RF ID card . In the example of the target apparatus information holds recorder ID for identifying the recorder . It should be noted that if an apparatus that can use the RF ID card according to Embodiment A7 of the present invention is limited for instance if only recorders can use the RF ID card the operation apparatus identification information and the target apparatus information may not be included in the apparatus operation information . In addition if the setting information processing unit in the recorder has a structure to change settings of the recorder by using the information in cards the medium identification information may not be included in the memory .

Operation instruction information indicates details of the operation to be performed by the apparatus designated in the apparatus operation information . In the example of the operation instruction information includes information indicating that setting is to be changed setting change information indicating a target for which the setting change is to be performed change target information and information indicating that communication is to be executed in obtaining the setting information communication execution .

It should be noted that the operation instruction information is not limited for a single operation but may include plural pieces of information for plural operations or may be a program in which the plural operations are combined.

Communication information is information regarding a server or the like. When the recorder is instructed based on the operation instruction information to access the server or the like to obtain data the recorder accesses the server or the like using the communication information . In the example of the communication information includes a URL login ID and a password of the server or the like. The URL may be replaced by an IP address. If the recorder is to access a different apparatus device via an office or home network the URL may be information for identifying the apparatus such as a MAC address.

The following describes processing by which the recorder registers the setting information from the recorder to a server by using the RF ID card with reference to .

At Step when the recorder receives an input from the user using the operation input unit the setting information processing unit causes the output signal processing unit to issue to the TV a request for message display. In response to the request the TV displays a message Please present a RF ID card on its screen at Step . The message may be displayed on a console not shown of the recorder . It is also possible that the recorder requests the user for authentication such as a password or biometric authentication when the user performs the input operation and after the authentication proceeds to the setting registration processing. It is further possible that the recorder does not request the TV for the message display but the user needs to present the RF ID card to the RF ID reader writer when using the recorder in order to perform steps of and after . It is still further possible that an enquiry message is displayed to enquire where the setting information is to be registered and the setting information is registered into the location the user designates. For example the setting information may be registered into the RF ID card or into a sever different from the server .

At Step the recorder detects the RF ID card. After that mutual authentication between the recorder and the RF ID card is performed at Step .

If the mutual authentication at Step is successful then the processing proceeds to Step . Otherwise the processing returns to Step to repeat the detection of the RF ID card.

At Step the recorder obtains the communication information from the memory in the RF ID card . If the memory in the RF ID card does not hold the communication information the recorder may issue to the user a request for providing the communication information. Moreover if the user instructs at Step the recorder to register the setting information into a location that is not designated in the RF ID card Step is not performed. If plural pieces of the communication information are stored in the RF ID card it is possible to display a list of the plural pieces of the communication information from which the user can select a desired one.

At Step the recorder gets the recorder ID and the setting information from the memory . The setting information is not limited to information currently stored but may be information inputted by the user in the setting registration processing.

At Step in the recorder the setting information processing unit issues to the communication unit a request for access to a server or the like having the URL included in the obtained communication information . The communication unit accesses the server using the login ID and the password .

At Step it is determined whether or not the access to the server is successful. If the access is successful then the processing proceeds to Step . Otherwise the setting registration processing is terminated.

At Step the recorder transmits to the server the UID and the recorder ID and the setting information which are obtained from the memory thereby registering the setting information into the server .

At Step the recorder generates the operation instruction information using a the operation designated at Step or a storage location of the setting information selected at Step b the setting information obtained at Step and c the communication information obtained at Step .

At Step the recorder performs the same step as Step to cause the TV to displays a message Please present a RF ID card on its screen.

At Step the recorder detects the RF ID card. After that mutual authentication between the recorder and the RF ID card is performed at Step .

If the mutual authentication at Step is successful then the processing proceeds to Step . Otherwise the processing returns to Step to repeat the detection of the RF ID card .

At Step it is determined whether or not the UID obtained at Step matches the UID obtained at Step . If the UIDs match then the processing proceeds to Step . Otherwise the processing returns to Step to repeat the detection of the RF ID card .

At Step the recorder transmits to the RF ID card the operation apparatus identification information not shown in stored in the memory the recorder ID the operation instruction information generated at Step and the communication information in order to record register these pieces of information onto the memory of the RF ID card . As a result the setting registration processing is completed.

Referring to the setting information registered into the server by the above described processing of is described.

Each of the setting information registered in the server is hereinafter referred to as setting information . Each setting information is registered in association with a corresponding one of the UID and a corresponding one of the target apparatus information . In more detail the setting information holds an identifier indicating for example menu screen background color Black . In the example of a letter A or B at the end of pieces of the setting information indicates that the setting is different from another.

It is also possible that plural pieces of setting information are registered for a single UID such as UID in . It is further possible that a single piece of the target apparatus information such as REC is registered for plural pieces of setting information associated with different UID. Here the setting information may include the change target information .

Next referring to the apparatus operation information registered in the memory of the RF ID card by the above described processing of is described.

It is assumed in the example of that the UID designates UID and the medium identification information designates a card .

The apparatus operation information includes sets each including the operation apparatus identification information the target apparatus information the operation instruction information and the communication information . Here it is possible that the communication information is not registered as being information not related to the other pieces of information. For instance it is possible that only a piece of the communication information is registered to always access the same server in using the RF ID card .

The operation instruction information includes instruction detail information instruction target information and communication execution information . The instruction detail information holds an identifier indicating an operation to be performed by the device designated by the target apparatus information . The instruction target information holds an identifier indicating a setting such as a menu screen mode or recording mode of the apparatus to perform the operation such as REC . The communication execution information holds an identifier indicating whether or not communication is to be executed in performing the operation indicated in the instruction detail information . It should be noted that the apparatus operation information may include only the communication information if the operating to be performed using the RF ID card is limited to changing of setting.

The communication information holds a URL login ID a password and the like for accessing a server that is a partner of communication if the communication execution information indicates that the communication is to be executed.

Next the description is given for processing of changing the setting of the recorder by using the RF ID card with reference to . is a flowchart of processing by which the setting information processing unit in the recorder updates the setting information by using the RF ID card .

First at Step the recorder detects the RF ID card . After that at Step the recorder performs mutual authentication with the RF ID card .

At Step the recorder determines whether or not the mutual authentication is successful. If the mutual authentication is successful then the processing proceeds to Step . Otherwise the setting update processing is terminated.

At Step the recorder obtains the UID and the apparatus operation information from the memory of the RF ID card .

At Step the recorder searches the apparatus operation information for the operation apparatus identification information . At Step the recorder compares the searched out operation apparatus identification information to apparatus identification information not shown in the memory of the recorder .

If it is determined at Step that the operation device identification information matches the device identification information then the processing proceeds to Step . Otherwise the processing proceeds to Step .

At Step the recorder determines whether or not all pieces of the operation apparatus identification information in the apparatus operation information have been examined. If all pieces of the operation apparatus identification information have been examined then the setting update processing is terminated.

At Step the recorder searches the device operation information for the target apparatus information . At Step the recorder compares the searched out target apparatus information to the recorder ID in the memory of the recorder .

If it is determined at Step that the target device information matches the recorder ID then the processing proceeds to Step . Otherwise the setting update processing is terminated.

At Step the recorder obtains the operation instruction information associated with the target device information from the apparatus operation information .

At Step the recorder obtains the operation instruction information associated with the target apparatus information from the apparatus operation information .

At Step the recorder determines based on the instruction detail information in the operation instruction information in the device operation information that an operation to be performed is updating of setting and thereby accesses the server to obtain the setting information from the server . The step will be described in more detail with reference to .

At Step the recorder determines whether or not the obtainment of the setting information is successful. If the obtainment of the setting information is successful then the processing proceeds to Step . At Step the setting information processing unit in the recorder updates the setting information in the memory of the recorder by the setting information . On the other hand if the obtainment of the setting information fails then the setting update processing is terminated.

The following describes Step in in more detail with reference to . is a flowchart of processing by which the setting information processing unit in the recorder accesses the server to obtain the setting information from the server .

At Step the communication unit in the recorder accesses the server having the URL included in the communication information .

At Step the setting information processing unit provides the communication unit with the login ID and the password which are included in the communication information and thereby the communication unit logins to the server .

At Step it is determined whether or not authentication namely the login is successful. If the authentication is successful then the processing proceeds to Step . Otherwise the processing is terminated as being failure of obtaining the setting information .

At Step the recorder searches the server for UID. At Step the recorder determines whether or not the searched out UID matches the UID obtained at Step in . If the searched out UID matches the UID then the processing proceeds to Step . Otherwise the processing returns to Step to repeat the search for UID until it is determined at Step that all pieces of UID in the server have been examined. If it is determined at Step that all pieces of UID in the server have been examined then the processing is terminated as being failure of obtaining the setting information .

At Step the recorder searches the server for the target apparatus information associated with the UID . At Step the recorder determines whether or not the searched out target apparatus information matches the target apparatus information obtained at Step in . If the searched out target apparatus information matches the target apparatus information then the processing proceeds to Step . On the other hand if the searched out target apparatus information does not match the target apparatus information then the processing proceeds to Step then the processing returns to Step to repeat the search for the target apparatus information until it is determined at Step that all pieces of the target apparatus information in the server have been examined. If it is determined at Step that all pieces of the target apparatus information have been examined then the processing is terminated as being failure of obtaining the setting information .

At Step the recorder obtains from the server the setting information associated with the UID and the target apparatus information .

As described above the use of the RF ID card enables the user to perform setting of the recorder without complicated operations. Even if the user is not familiar with operations of apparatuses devices the user can easily change the setting of the recorder by using the RF ID card . Moreover the operation executable for the recorder by using the RF ID card is not limited to the setting change. For example the instruction detail information can designate an operation of obtaining a list of recorded contents in the recorder. In this case the list is registered in the RF ID card or the server. Thereby the user can check the list on a different apparatus device other than the recorder by using the RF ID card.

In addition the RF ID card holding information illustrated in the allows the user to perform timer recording in the recorder simply by presenting the RF ID card to the recorder. In more detail if the change target information associated with Index in is applied the recorder can perform timer recording according to setting of TV program ID and recording mode designated in the instruction target information simply by presenting the RF ID card to the recorder. Thereby the timer recording can be performed without accessing the server. In addition if the change target information associated with Index in is applied the recorder can perform timer recording according to TV program code designated in the instruction target information simply by presenting the RF ID card to the recorder. Here the recorder can obtain from the server a program ID or a start time and end time and b channel information. As a result the time recording can be performed according to the setting of the recording mode . Furthermore it is also possible that recommended TV program is designated in the instruction target information in the RF ID card. After presenting the RF ID card to the recorder the recorder obtains ID of the recommended TV program from the server. Thereby the recorder can obtain a content of the recommended TV program from the server and performs timer recording of the content. The above functions may be used as service for providing the RF ID card as being a supplement of a TV program guide magazine for example. This RF ID card can reduce user s bothersome procedures for timer recording. For another service it is also possible in the RF ID card that the instruction detail information designates a download operation the instruction target information designates video or software in a version where a function is restricted and the communication information designates a URL of a download website. Such RF ID cards are provided for free to users. The users can use the video or software as trial and purchase it if the user likes it.

It should be noted that the description in Embodiment A7 has been given for the recorder but the present invention is not limited to the recorder.

For example Embodiment A7 of the present invention may be implemented as a TV having a reader writer for the RF ID card and the setting information processing unit. The TV can register as the change target information a setting of an initial display channel or initial sound volume immediately after power on b setting of child lock for excluding adult broadcasts and violence scenes c setting of zapping for favorite channels d setting of contrast and brightness of a screen e setting of a language f setting of a continuous use time and the like simply by presenting the RF ID card to the TV. Thereby the TV can perform settings according to usability. Furthermore Embodiment A7 may be implemented also as a vehicle navigation system having a reader writer for the RF ID card and the setting information processing unit. In this aspect the instruction detail information designates highlighted display and the instruction target information designates landmark information . Thereby by using the RF ID card the vehicle navigation system can display the designated landmark as being highlighted by changing a character font character size or color. The landmark information may be obtained from a server.

In this case the RF ID cards on which the apparatus operation information illustrated in is recorded are offered to users at rest areas or interchanges on expressways sightseeing spots and the like. Thereby the RF ID cards allow vehicle navigation systems of the users to display a recommended landmark where an even is currently held for example as highlighted display. In addition Embodiment A7 may be implemented as a laptop having a reader writer for the RF ID card and the setting information processing unit. The laptop can designate a setting of a resolution of a screen b setting of a position of an icon or the like on a display c setting of a wallpaper d setting of a screen saver e setting of start up of resident software f setting of employed peripheral devices g setting of a dominant hand for a mouse or the like and the like by simply by presenting the RF ID card to the laptop. Therefore if the user brings the RF ID card in a business trip the user can operate a different personal computer at the business trip location with the same settings as those the user usually uses. Embodiment A7 may be implemented further as a game machine having a reader writer for the RF ID card and the setting information processing unit. The user visiting a friend s house uses a RF ID card in which the instruction detail information designates setting change. By presenting the RF ID card to the game machine at the friend s house the user can change a setting of positions of keys on a remote controller and b setting of a structure of a menu screen. In addition the user can save data in the game machine by using the RF ID card. Moreover the following service using the RF ID card is also possible. The RF ID card holds the instruction detail information designating a download operation. Such RF ID cards are offered to users as supplements of magazines or the like. The users can use the RF ID cards to download an additional scenario a rare item or the like.

The RF ID card according to Embodiment A7 of the present invention can be also applied to home appliances connected to one another via a network. In this aspect the RF ID card previously holds a setting of a temperature of an air conditioner b setting for a temperature of hot water in a bus tab and the like depending of the user s preference. Thereby the user presents the RF ID card to RF ID reader writers in the user s house so as to manage settings of the home appliances at once. In addition the RF ID card may designate an operation for checking foods stored in a refrigerator. Here information of the foods which is registered in the refrigerator is obtained by using RF ID tags previously attached to the foods. Or video of the inside of the refrigerator is captured by using camcorder. Thereby the user can check a list of the foods on a TV by using a RF ID reader writer to obtain information from the RF ID card. As described above the RF ID card according to Embodiment A7 of the present invention can be applied for various usages. It is also possible to combine a RF ID cards for designating apparatuses such as four different cards indicating heating appliance cooling appliance stove and fan respectively and b RF ID cards for designating setting of the apparatuses such as three different cards indicating weak medium and strong respectively . It is further possible that such RF ID cards having the apparatus designating and setting designating functions are integrated into a single RF ID card. And the settings of the apparatuses can be customized.

Although only some exemplary embodiments of the present invention have been described in detail above those skilled in the art will be readily appreciate that many modifications are possible in the exemplary embodiments without materially departing from the novel teachings and advantages of the present invention. Accordingly all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention.

For example if two users hereinafter referred to as a user A and a user B exchanges photographs between them the user B can view photographs taken by the user A by the following method. The user B has a TV having an apparatus ID and a relay server having a URL. The apparatus ID and the URL are previously stored in a RF ID hereinafter referred to as a RF tag B . The user B generates information hereinafter referred to as device generation information B from the information in the RF tag B and stores the generated device generation information B into the RF tag B. The user B transmits the device generation information B to the user A via e mail or the like. The user A stores a URL of a server holding the photographs into the relay server in association with the received device generation information B. Thereby the user B simply presents the RF tab B to a RF ID reader writer of the TV in order to view the photographs taken by the user A. Here it is assumed that the RF tag B previously holds an e mail address of the user A. When the user B simply presents the RF tag B to the RF ID reader writer of the TV the device generation information B may be automatically written into the TV and a notification of the device generation information B may be automatically transmitted to the e mail address of the user A. Thereby even if the user B is not familiar with operations of the devices the user B can exchange photographs with the user A. Furthermore it is also possible that the user A encrypts at least one of a URL login ID and a password by using the device generation information B and sends to the user B a post card with RF ID on which the encrypted information is recorded. This makes it possible to restrict an apparatus permitted to display the photographs only to the TV of the user B. It is further possible that the user A sends to the user B a post card with two RF IDs that are a RF ID for sending and a RF ID for returning. In this aspect the user A records onto the RF ID for returning device generation information A that is previously generated by a TV or the like of the user A. This can restrict an apparatus permitted to display photographs stored by the user B. More specifically when the user B receives the post card with the two RF IDs and returns the post card to the user A the user B encrypts by using the device generation information A a URL a login ID or a password of a server storing the photographs of the user B and then records the encrypted data onto the RF ID for returning. Or when the user B stores the photographs the user B associates the photographs with the device generation information A. Therefore an apparatus permitted to display photographs stored by the user B can be restricted.

Moreover the mailing object UID of the RF ID on the mailing object may be a combination of a a group ID that is common among a plurality of mailing objects and b a UID unique that is unique to each mailing object. Thereby image data in the server is associated not with every mailing object UID but with the group ID. Therefore when post cards with RF ID on which the image data is associated with a plurality of targets are mailed it is possible to eliminate user s bothersome procedures for performing registration for each of the UIDs. It is also possible that the image data stored in the server in association with the group ID is switched to be permitted or inhibited to be viewed for each of the UID. Thereby if for example a printer prints destination addresses on the mailing objects the printer having a RF ID reader writer reads the UIDs on the mailing objects and thereby associates the UIDs with addresses in an address list respectively. Thereby the address list can be used to manage the permission inhibition of viewing the images stored in the server.

It is also possible that a post card or card is provided with a plurality of RF ID tags having various different functions. In this aspect the single post card or card can switch the functions by disconnecting communication of a part of the RF ID tags which are not currently used. For example a post card has a an upper portion on which a RF ID tag having a function of displaying a slide show of photographs is attached and b a lower portion on which a RF ID tag having a function of reproducing video. A user can switch the display function or the reproduction function by selecting the upper portion or the lower portion to be brought into proximity of a RF ID reader writer. The RF ID tags having different functions can be provided to a front side and a back side of the post card. It is also possible that covers made of a material blocking communications are applied on the RF ID tags so that the user can select a RF ID tag to be used by opening the cover on it.

It is further possible that photographs are stored in a plurality of servers and a RF ID tag holds URLs of the servers. Thereby a user can access the servers to obtain the photographs to display them in a list.

Moreover the RF ID reader writer may be provided not only to an apparatus device such as the TV or the recorder but also to the input means such as a remote controller for operating the apparatus. For instance if a plurality of apparatuses are connected to one another via a network an input means for collectively operating the apparatuses may be provided with a RF ID reader writer to operate the respective apparatuses. Furthermore an input means such as a remote controller may be provided with an individual authentication means for biometric authentication such as fingerprint authentication or face authentication password or the like. In this aspect the input means having a RF ID reader writer exchanges data with a RF ID tag only when the individual authentication is successful. It is also possible that the individual authentication information is previously stored in the RF ID tag and individual authentication is performed by the apparatus or the remote controller using the RF ID tag.

It should be noted that the definition of the term RF ID frequently used in the description of the present invention is not limited to narrow meaning. In general the term RF ID narrowly refers to a tag having a nonvolatile memory on which identification information is recorded . RF ID having a dual interface function or a security function seems commonly called as a IC card or the like. However in the embodiments of the present invention the RF ID widely refers to an electronic circuit which has a nonvolatile memory on which individual identification information is recorded and which can transmit the individual identification information to the outside via an antenna .

Conventionally if a user who is not familiar with operations of an apparatus device wishes to perform complicated settings for the apparatus it is necessary that a seller repairer or serviceperson of the apparatus visits a location of the apparatus to perform the settings or controls the apparatus remotely. Even in remotely controlling the apparatus the seller repairer or serviceperson has to visit the location for setting of the remote control. In Embodiment A7 of the present invention however the RF ID card enables the user to perform the settings of the apparatus the recorder without complicated operations. Therefore even the user not familiar with operations of the recorder can easily change the settings of the recorder.

The present invention can be implemented also as an image presentation method of presenting image related to a communication device on an apparatus device having a display screen in a communication system having a the apparatus having the display screen b a reader device connected to the apparatus via a communication path and c the communication device performing proximity wireless communication with the reader device. The present invention can be implemented further as a program stored in the communication device with identification information of the communication device the program being described by codes executed by a virtual machine included in a device performing proximity wireless communication with the communication device and being for executing accessing a server connected via a communication network downloading form the server image associated with the identification information from among image stored in the accessed server and displaying the downloaded image. In addition the present invention can be implemented as a computer readable recording medium such as a CD ROM on which the above program is recorded.

The communication device according to the present invention may be used of course as various devices having a RF ID unit in which identification information and a virtual machine program are stored. For example the communication device may be electronic devices such as a camera home appliances such as a rice cooker and a refrigerator and daily commodities such as a toothbrush.

Here an embodiment in which a RF ID reader is provided to a remote controller of a TV or the like is described with reference to diagrams a and b in a flowchart c in and a flowchart of .

First as described earlier a child device or child communicator such as a camera has the memory second memory and the antenna . When an antenna of a remote controller is moved into proximity of the antenna the antenna supplies power to the antenna . Thereby data in the memory is transmitted from the antenna to the antenna . The remote controller converts the received data into digital data by a communication circuit and then stores the digital data into a memory Step in . Then a transmission unit of the remote controller is faced to the TV and a transmission switch on the remote controller is pressed Step . Thereby the data in the memory is transmitted as light to a light receiving unit of the parent device apparatus the TV via a light emitting unit Step . The communication may be not light but wireless.

Referring back to a flowchart c in the embodiment of the present invention used in social systems should be applicable even in twenty or thirty years. An example of the program described in a virtual machine language or the like is known Java . However such programs are expected to be extended or replaced by totally different programs described in more efficient languages. In order to address the above situation in the embodiment of the present invention the parent device such as the TV holds parent device version information or parent device version information n that indicates a language type or version of a virtual machine language or the like Step in c of . In the beginning of the memory of the child communication device child device version information or child device version information n indicating a version of a program language or the like for the child device is recorded a in . Following to the child device version information a program region is recorded in the memory . The program region stores a program in a version a program in a version and a program in a version . Following to the program region a data region is recorded in the memory .

At Step in the flowchart of the parent device stores the parent device version information nof the parent device is stored. Then the parent device obtains the child device version information nfrom the memory of the child device Step . Then the parent device selects an execution program n having a maximum value of n n Step . The parent device executes the selected execution program Step . Then it is determined whether or not the parent device is connected to the Internet Step . If the parent device is connected to the Internet then the parent device is connected to the server via the Internet Step . The parent device thereby transmits language information which is set in the parent device to the server Step . The server provides the parent device with a program in the language indicated in the transmitted language information for example in French and causes the parent device to execute the program. Alternatively the server may execute the program on the server itself.

On the other hand if it is determined at Step that the parent device is not connected to the Internet then the processing proceeds to Step . At Step the parent device executes a local program in order to display on a screen of the parent device attribute information of the child device . The attribute information is for example information for notifying a trouble or information regarding the number of stored photographs. As described above the memory in the child device holds the child device version information . The memory stores a program procedure URL or the like of each generation. The program procedure URL or the like will be developed every 10 years. Such data format on which information is recorded for each generation can be kept being used even in twenty or thirty years in order to operate the parent device . a of illustrates an example of information on which versions or generations of a program are recorded. However the same advantages are also offered in another example illustrated in b of . In b of addresses of data stored in the server are recorded in associated with respective different versions. In this example a URL in a version a URL in a version and a URL in a version are recorded. The above can achieve backward compatibility for many years. For example it is assumed that a user purchases a product the parent device in version 1 this year and the product has RF ID. Under the assumption it is expected that in twenty or thirty years programs described in virtual machine languages or the like such as Java which are compliant to versions 1 2 and 3 will be installed into the parent device . In the situation the child device can provide the parent device with the child device version information . Based on the child device version information the parent device can select a program to be compliant to an appropriate version. It is also expected that in thirty years the child device will hold information of programs in all versions 1 2 and 3. Therefore a different parent device in version 3 employs the best function of a version among them. On the other hand the former parent device in version 1 employs a rather limited function of a version older than the version employed by the parent device in version 3. As a result perfect compatibility can be achieved.

The flowchart of is explained below. At Step pressing a read switch on the remote controller a user brings the remote controller into proximity of the antenna of the child device . Thereby data in the memory of the child device is transmitted to the memory of the remote controller . Next at Step facing the remote controller to the parent device such as a TV the user presses a transmission switch Step . Thereby the data in the memory is transmitted as light to the parent device Step . In the embodiment of the present invention the data is referred to as tag data for convenience. The parent device extracts or selects an execution program from the tag data Step . The parent device executes the extracted or selected execution program by a virtual machine language set in the parent device Step . The parent device reads Internet connection identification information for the parent device Step . At Step it is determined whether or not the identification information does not indicate Connectable to the Internet in other words it is determined based on the identification information whether or not the parent device is connectable to the Internet. If the identification information does not indicate Connectable to the Internet until Step then the parent device executes a non connectable state program in the execution program Step . The non connectable state program is to be executed when the parent device is not connectable to the Internet. Then the parent device displays a result of the execution on its screen Step . In the embodiment of the present invention the memory stores not only the information regarding connection to the Internet but also the non connectable state program to be executed when the parent device is not connectable to the Internet. Therefore the parent device can display a result of a minimum required operation when the parent device is not connectable to the Internet.

On the other hand if it is determined at Step that the identification information indicates Connectable to the Internet then the parent device executes a connection program Step . The connection program includes a part of the above execution program.

The connection program may be generated by adding into the execution program in the tag data data such as a URL of the server user ID and a password. More specifically the added such as a URL of the server user ID and a password are added in the data region illustrated in a of . Such connection program can extend the execution program in the tag data and also reduce a capacity of the nonvolatile memory in the memory . In this case it is also possible that the connection program in the memory is recorded onto a memory such as a non rewritable ROM in the program region while the URL of the server and the like are recorded onto the data region that is rewritable. As a result a tip area and a cost can be reduced.

At Step the parent device connects to a server having a specific URL. At Step it is determined whether or not the server requests the parent device to upload data to the server. If the server requests for uploading of data then at Step the parent device uploads data and or a program to the server. The server executes a program using the data Step . The server provides a result of the execution to the parent device Step . The parent device displays the result and the like of the execution on its screen Step .

On the other hand if it is determined at Step that the server does not request for uploading of data then the parent device downloads information including a specific program from the server having the URL Step . The parent device executes the downloaded program Step . Then the parent device displays the result of the execution on its screen.

The memory in the RF ID unit or the child device has a limited capacity due to restriction on power consumption a volume or a cost. Therefore a common program cannot be stored in the memory. However the use of the connection program and the server as described in the embodiment of the present invention allows an infinitely large program to be executed.

A huge program may be executed on the server. Or such a program may be downloaded from the server to be executed. These aspects are in the scope of the present invention.

The embodiment described with reference to has been described to use a remote controller of a TV. In this example the remote controller has a battery buttons for switching TV channels an antenna for reading RF ID a communication circuit and an infrared light emitting unit. The remote controller can be replaced by a mobile phone to produce the same effects as described above. Since mobile phones generally have an infrared light emitting unit they are easily used instead of remote controllers. In addition mobile phones have a communication line. Therefore mobile phones can offer the same capability of that of remote controller being directly connected to the server. However a communication cost of a mobile phone is burden of a user. A display screen of a mobile phone is significantly smaller than that of a TV. Therefore a mobile phone may have the transmission switch as illustrated in . Thereby if there is a TV near the mobile phone the user faces the light emitting unit of the mobile phone to the TV to transmit tag data in the memory of the mobile phone directly to the TV. As a result the user can view data on a large screen of the TV having a high resolution. The above method does not incur a cost which is greatly advantageous for the user. The communication using the readout tag data via the mobile phone line is stopped in cooperation with the transmission switch.

In this case in the same manner as described for as the remote controller with reference to the mobile phone has at least a reader for RF ID or a Near Field Communication NFC unit. In the future mobile phones are expected to have a reader function for reading RF ID or the like. If RF ID readers are provided to mobile phones the present invention can be implemented with a much lower additional cost which is greatly advantageous for the user. Moreover the present invention can be easily implemented not only as a remote controller or a mobile phone but also as a Personal Digital Assistance PDA terminal a laptop or a mobile media player.

In this embodiment consider a situation where under the above mentioned environment the user who is watching video on the TV wants to watch it on the TV upstairs. In the case of moving to another place to watch the video it is desirable that the user can watch the video seamlessly from the point up to which the user has already watched. However in order to seamlessly move the video while maintaining security user authentication and timing synchronization are necessary and the user is required to perform complex operations.

To solve the above problem processing such as user authentication and timing synchronization is performed by extremely simple information exchange through the use of RFID in this embodiment of the present invention. In detail the RFID tag of the mobile AV terminal is brought into proximity of the RFID tag of the TV to exchange information for authentication and timing synchronization through the RFID tag.

In this embodiment of the present invention according to the above structure video passing can be performed by an extremely simple operation of causing the mobile AV terminal and the TV touch each other thereby significantly improving user friendliness.

To perform video passing the user presses a video passing button . When the video passing button is pressed a video passing request generation unit obtains video information currently displayed by the video display unit from a display information management unit generates a video passing request and writes the video passing request in a memory of the RFID unit. In the case where no video is being displayed the video passing request generation unit enters a video get mode and generates the video passing request including a video get command. In the case where video is being displayed the video passing request generation unit enters a video give mode and generates the video passing request including a video give command and video information. The video information mentioned here includes video display time information managed in the display information management unit and connection destination information managed in a communication and broadcast management unit . When receiving video via a broadcast interface the communication and broadcast management unit manages channel information. When receiving video via a communication interface the communication and broadcast management unit manages an identifier of a video server and an identifier of video. The identifier of the video server and the identifier of the video may be any identifiers uniquely identifying the video server and the video such as an IP address and a URL. Note that the video passing button may be provided separately as a video get button and a video give button. Moreover selection of whether to get or give video may be displayed on the screen when the video passing button is pressed. When another RFID tag is brought into proximity information stored in the memory in the RFID unit is transmitted from a transmission unit via a wireless antenna . In the case where no transmission is made within a predetermined time after the generation of the video passing command the video passing mode is cancelled and the information in the memory is discarded. A receiving unit in the RFID unit receives a video passing response. The video passing response is a response indicating whether or not the video get command or the video give command is accepted. In the case where the video passing response indicates that the video get command is accepted the video passing response includes video information. The video passing response is outputted to the communication and broadcast management unit and the communication and broadcast management unit performs processing according to the video passing response. In the case where the video passing response indicates that the video get command is accepted the communication and broadcast management unit performs video get processing. In the case where the video information included in the video passing response is channel information the communication and broadcast management unit notifies the broadcast interface of the channel information to receive data of a channel designated by the channel information. The communication and broadcast management unit also instructs a display management unit to display the data of the channel. In the case where the channel information designates a channel a channel of BS CS or cable TV that is not receivable by the broadcast interface of the mobile AV terminal the communication and broadcast management unit requests a communication unit to search for a terminal that is capable of receiving data of the channel and transferring it to the communication interface . Note that the search for the terminal that serves to transfer the data of the channel may be performed beforehand. Even when the data of the channel is received by the communication interface the data of the channel is displayed by the video display unit in the same way as in the normal case. In the case where the video information included in the video passing response is connection destination information the communication and broadcast management unit notifies the communication unit of the connection destination information to transmit a video transmission request to a connection destination. The video transmission request includes a video display time and data transmission is requested according to this time. Note that unlike video reception by the broadcast interface video reception by the communication interface may take some time. This depends on preprocessing for receiving video data by the communication interface and a time period during which video data is temporarily stored in a communication buffer . In the method of this embodiment unnecessary data transmission and a waiting time associated with it may be reduced by predicting such a time beforehand and issuing the video transmission request from the communication unit on the basis of the predicted time. In this case a display time correction unit performs correction so that video can be displayed seamlessly. This is possible because data of digital video is typically stored in a display buffer and displayed by the video display unit while being processed by a display processing unit . On the other hand in the case where the video passing response indicates that the video give command is accepted screen display is cleared. Note that the screen display may be automatically cleared or whether or not to clear the screen display may be selected by the user. Alternatively the screen display may be cleared upon receiving a screen display clearing instruction from the terminal to which video is passed. Moreover a timer may be provided so that the screen display is cleared after a predetermined time has elapsed.

A receiving unit upon receiving a video passing request from an antenna of a RFID tag outputs the video passing request to a communication and broadcast management unit . In the case where the received video passing request is a video get command the communication and broadcast management unit outputs managed connection destination information of displayed video to a video passing response generation unit . Upon receiving the connection destination information the video passing response generation unit obtains display time information from a display information management unit generates a video passing response and writes the video passing response in a memory in the RFID unit. Here when the video passing response generation unit cannot obtain desired information the video passing response generation unit generates the video passing response indicating that the video passing request is rejected. A transmission unit transmits the written video passing response to the RFID unit of the mobile AV terminal . Video display termination processing after transmission is the same as in the mobile AV terminal . In the case where the received video passing request is a video give command on the other hand the communication and broadcast management unit performs processing according to information included in the video passing request. In the case where channel information is included in the video passing request the communication and broadcast management unit notifies a broadcast interface of the channel information to receive data of a desired channel designated by the channel information. The communication and broadcast management unit then notifies a display management unit of the data of the channel thereby changing the display. In the case where the video giving command is received while video is being displayed determination of which video is to be prioritized may be made by a video priority determination unit or a selection command may be displayed. In the case where connection destination information is included in the video passing request the communication and broadcast management unit notifies a communication unit of the connection destination information to transmit a video transmission request. Subsequent processing is the same as in the mobile AV terminal. Moreover the functions of the other units are the same as those in the mobile AV terminal.

To perform video passing the user powers on the mobile AV terminal . The mobile AV terminal searches for an access point of the wireless LAN and establishes wireless connection. The mobile AV terminal also obtains an IP address by DHCP or the like and establishes IP connection. In the case where the mobile AV terminal is a DLNA terminal DLNA terminal search processing such as M SEARCH may be performed. The user presses the video passing button to generate a video passing request in the memory in the RFID unit. The user further brings the RFID tag of the mobile AV terminal into proximity of the RFID tag reader writer of the TV to transmit the video passing request to the TV . Upon receiving the video passing request the TV generates a video passing response including an IP address of the video server a video identifier and a video display time and returns the video passing response to the mobile AV terminal . It is assumed here that the TV obtains the IP address of the video server beforehand even when the video receiving means of the TV has no IP connection such as a HDMI cable. In the case where the video is in encrypted form necessary security related information such as a key is exchanged at the same time. Upon receiving the video passing response the mobile AV terminal transmits a video transmission request including the video identifier and the video display time to the IP address of the video server included in the video passing response. Upon receiving the video transmission request the video server switches a video transmission destination to the mobile AV terminal . Having no longer received the video data the TV turns video display OFF.

The user presses the video passing button of the mobile AV terminal to generate a video passing request including the IP address of the video server the video identifier and the video display time . The user further brings the RFID tag of the mobile AV terminal into proximity of a RFID tag reader writer of the TV to transmit the video passing request to the TV . The TV generates a video passing response indicating that the video passing request is accepted and returns the video passing response to the mobile AV terminal . The TV transmits a video transmission request to the video server . Subsequent processing is the same as in .

When the user presses the video passing button S the mobile AV terminal enters a video get mode S in the case where the screen is blank or has no video display S . In the case where the screen is not blank a selection screen is displayed S . When the user selects get S the mobile AV terminal equally enters the video get mode. When the user selects give the mobile AV terminal enters a video give mode S . In the video get mode the mobile AV terminal stores a video passing request including a video get command in the memory in the RFID unit. The user brings the RFID unit of the mobile AV terminal into proximity of the RFID unit of the other terminal S to transmit the video passing request to the other terminal S . Upon receiving a video passing response from the other terminal S the mobile AV terminal performs processing according to information included in the video passing response. In the case where no response is obtained the mobile AV terminal displays an error screen indicating no response and ends processing S . In the case where terrestrial channel information is included in the video passing response the mobile AV terminal determines whether or not the mobile AV terminal is capable of receiving the corresponding channel that is whether nor not the mobile AV terminal has a tuner and an antenna and is in a terrestrial wave receivable range . In the case where the mobile AV terminal is capable of receiving the channel S the mobile AV terminal displays data of the designated channel. In the case where the mobile AV terminal is not capable of receiving the channel the mobile AV terminal enters a wireless LAN transfer mode S . Likewise in the case where channel information of BS or the like which is basically not receivable by the mobile AV terminal is included in the video passing response S the mobile AV terminal enters the wireless LAN transfer mode. On the other hand in the case where no channel information is included in the video passing response the mobile AV terminal enters a wireless. LAN receiving mode S .

In the video give mode the mobile AV terminal stores a video passing request including a video give command and information of video to be given in the memory in the RFID unit. The user brings the RFID unit of the mobile AV terminal into proximity of the RFID unit of the other terminal S to transmit the video passing request to the other terminal S . Upon receiving a video passing response from the other terminal S the mobile AV terminal performs processing according to information included in the video passing response. In the case where no response is obtained the mobile AV terminal displays an error screen indicating no response and ends processing S . In the case where the video passing response indicates that video passing is disabled S the mobile AV terminal displays an error screen indicating that video passing is disabled and ends processing S . In the case where video passing is enabled and video to be passed is being received via terrestrial wave S the mobile AV terminal stops screen display of terrestrial broadcasting. Otherwise the mobile AV terminal performs termination processing of video that is being received via wireless LAN according to a type of corresponding receiving system S . The mobile AV terminal thereby stops screen display. Note that the screen display may be stopped according to an instruction from the terminal on the video give side or the screen display may be switched to another screen such as an initial screen S .

The mobile AV terminal is assumed to be a terminal that is capable of receiving terrestrial wave but is not capable of receiving satellite broadcasting and cable TV broadcasting. To receive such broadcast wave the broadcast wave needs to be received by another terminal capable of receiving the broadcast wave and transferred to the mobile AV terminal via wireless LAN. In the wireless LAN transfer mode the mobile AV terminal calls information of a wireless LAN transfer capable apparatus. In the case where the information of the wireless LAN transfer capable apparatus is not held in the mobile AV terminal S the mobile AV terminal searches for the wireless LAN transfer capable apparatus S . In the case where the wireless LAN transfer capable apparatus cannot be found in the house the mobile AV terminal displays an error screen indicating that channel passing is disabled S . In the case where the wireless LAN transfer capable apparatus is found or the information of the capable apparatus is held in the mobile AV terminal the mobile AV terminal transmits a video transfer request for the channel to the wireless LAN transfer capable apparatus S . In the case where a video transfer enable response is returned from the wireless LAN transfer capable apparatus the mobile AV terminal receives video packets of the designated channel via wireless LAN S and displays the video of the designated channel S .

In the wireless LAN receiving mode in the case where the video passing response includes an IP address of a video server and an ID and display time information of video S the mobile AV terminal accesses the video server. First the mobile AV terminal determines whether or not the IP address of the video server is in the same subnet as the IP address of the mobile AV terminal S . In the case where the IP address of the video server is in the same subnet as the IP address of the mobile AV terminal the mobile AV terminal transmits a video transmission request including the video ID and display time to the video server S . Note that in the case where a delay time correction function is available S the mobile AV terminal corrects the display time information in the video transmission request S . Here the display time correction function denotes a correction function that is executed to perform efficient video transfer in consideration of various delay in processing. In the case where video cannot be received from the video server S the mobile AV terminal may retransmit the video transmission request. In the case where there is no response even after a predetermined retransmission timeout occurs S the mobile AV terminal displays an error screen indicating no server response S . In the case where the time of the received video data does not coincide with the time of display S the mobile AV terminal adjusts the time to the time of display using a control packet for fast forward or rewind S . The mobile AV terminal then displays video.

In the case where the URL is included S the mobile AV terminal performs name resolution by DNS to obtain the IP address of the video server S . Note that the URL for video may be any name assigned for video service. The name resolution also includes conversion from a service identifier to a terminal identifier other than DNS. In the case where the obtained IP address of the video server is the same as the IP address of the mobile AV terminal the mobile AV terminal returns to the processing described in . In the case where the IP address of the video server is not in the same subnet as the IP address of the mobile AV terminal the mobile AV terminal proceeds to connection processing to a server outside the subnet. In the case where the desired information is not included in the video passing response the mobile AV terminal displays an error screen indicating that the video passing response is invalid.

In the case where the IP address of the video server is in a different subnet the mobile AV terminal searches for another wireless access point. In the case where there is no other access point in the house the mobile AV terminal determines that the video server is an external server and proceeds to external server connection processing. In the case where there is another access point S the mobile AV terminal performs reconnection to the access point and obtains another IP address of a subnet S . In the case where the subnet of the video server is the same as the subnet of the obtained IP address S the mobile AV terminal proceeds to home server processing. In the case where the subnet of the video server is not the same as the subnet of the IP address obtained by connecting to the accessible access point in the house S the mobile AV terminal proceeds to external server access processing. Note that the mobile AV terminal may perform IP address obtainment processing for all access points beforehand and manage the processing result therein.

In the case where the address of the video server is not a global address S the mobile AV terminal displays an error screen indicating an address error S . In the case where an access method to the designated video server is unknown S the mobile AV terminal displays an error screen indicating that the access method is unknown S . Note that a home video server and a home video appliance are assumed to be compliant with DLNA. In the case where the access method is known and also the video server has the same function as a home server the mobile AV terminal performs the same processing as in the case of a home server S . Otherwise the mobile AV terminal performs processing according to the access method to obtain video S and displays the received video S .

When the RFID unit of the other terminal is brought into proximity of the RFID unit of the TV S the TV receives a video passing request S . In the case where the TV is receiving video S and also a video get command is included in the video passing request S the TV enters a video give mode S . In the case where the TV is not receiving video but the video get command is included in the video passing request S the TV returns a video passing response indicating that video passing is disabled S and displays an error screen indicating that video passing is disabled S . In the case where the video is being received via terrestrial wave S the TV returns the video passing response including channel information S . The TV then clears screen display S .

In the case where the video being received is broadcast video other than terrestrial wave S the TV returns the video passing response including channel information. In the case of a wireless LAN transfer mode the TV may include the IP address of the TV in the video passing response S . After returning the response the TV clears screen display S . In the case of other video the TV returns the video passing response including an IP address of a video server a video ID and a video display time or including a video URL and a video display time S . After this the TV performs termination processing of video communication via wireless LAN S and clears screen display.

When the TV receives the video give command while displaying video the TV enters a video get mode S in the case where a double screen display function is available S . In the case where the double screen display function is not available the TV displays a selection screen of whether or not to get video S . When the user selects to get video S the TV enters the video get mode. When the user selects not to get video the TV returns a video passing response indicating that video passing is disabled S . In the case where channel information is included in the video passing request S the TV displays data of a designated channel S . In the case where an IP address of a video server or a URL is included in the video passing request S S the TV performs the same processing as in the video get mode of the mobile AV terminal. In the case where such information is not included in the video passing request the TV displays an information error screen S .

As in the user powers on the mobile AV terminal to pass the video. The mobile AV terminal searches for the access point of wireless LAN and establishes wireless connection. The mobile AV terminal also obtains an IP address by DHCP or the like and establishes IP connection. The user presses the video passing button to generate a video passing request in the memory in the RFID unit. Here the video passing request includes the IP address of the mobile AV terminal . The user further brings the RFID tag of the mobile AV terminal into proximity of the RFID tag reader writer of the TV to transmit the video passing request to the TV . The TV returns a video passing response including the IP address of the video server to the mobile AV terminal . This step is intended to enhance security to prevent arbitrary access from an irrelevant terminal and may be omitted. As in in the case where video is in encrypted form necessary security related information such as a key is exchanged at the same time. Upon receiving the video passing request the TV transmits a video transmission request including the IP address of the mobile AV terminal to the video server . Upon receiving the video transmission request the video server switches a video transmission destination to the mobile AV terminal . Subsequent processing is the same as in .

This may be omitted as in . Upon receiving the video passing request the TV returns a video passing response including the IP address of the TV . Upon receiving the video passing response the mobile AV terminal transmits a video transmission request including the IP address of the TV to the video server . Upon receiving the video transmission request the video server changes the video transmission destination to the TV . Subsequent processing is the same as in .

Here the remote controller is assumed to be a terminal that does not have a display unit but has a transmission and reception unit and a memory of a RFID unit. The user presses a video passing button to generate a video passing request in the memory in the RFID unit. The user further brings the RFID unit of the remote controller into proximity of the RFID unit of the TV to transmit the video passing request to the TV . Upon receiving the video passing request the TV generates a video passing response including the IP address of the video server a video identifier and a video display time and returns the video passing response to the remote controller . Moreover upon receiving the video passing request from the remote controller the TV transmits a video stop request to the video server . After going upstairs the user brings the RFID unit of the remote controller into proximity of the RFID unit of the TV to transmit a video passing response including the IP address of the video server the video identifier and the video display time . Upon receiving the video passing request the TV returns a video passing response and transmits a video transmission request including the video identifier and the video display time to the video server . The video server starts transmitting the designated video from the designated time.

After conducting predetermined communication with the TV the mobile AV terminal transmits a video transmission request to the video server . Upon receiving the video transmission request the video server temporarily transmits video data to both the TV and the mobile AV terminal . This processing is intended to achieve complete seamlessness. The mobile AV terminal and the TV may both display the video temporarily or some kind of synchronization processing may be performed to achieve complete seamlessness. The video server stops video data transfer to the TV on the basis of a video stop request from the mobile AV terminal . Note that the TV may transmit the stop request or the video server may automatically stop video data transfer.

This embodiment relates to a best mode of a method for ensuring traceability in a distribution form from factory shipment to use environment of an apparatus device provided with a RFID tag as described in Embodiments A1 to A10.

Recently given a need to improve distribution efficiency and also an increase in number of accidents caused by aging of home electrical products there has been debate for ensuring traceability namely an ability to trace from manufacture and distribution through to a use environment by a consumer.

As an example an attempt has been made to enable management from manufacture to distribution to a retailer by adding a passive RFID tag that uses a communication frequency in a band of 860 to 900 MHz to a package a returnable container or the like. The band of 860 to 900 MHz is also called a UHF UltraHigh Frequency band. The RFID tag in the UHF band can exhibit a largest communication distance in the passive type i.e. the type of tag to which power is supplied from outside and is capable of communication of 2 to 3 m though depending on output magnitude. Accordingly by simultaneously passing a plurality of products through a RFID reader gate during transportation RFID information of the plurality of products can be instantly read with efficiency. Hence the RFID tag is particularly expected to be used in the field of distribution.

However such a RFID tag of the UHF band has the following problem. Though the RFID tag certainly has an advantage of long distance communication the apparatus cannot be traced once it has been delivered to the consumer because the RFID tag is added to the package or the returnable container. Besides the long distance feature is not particularly effective in an entity interface an object interface or an intuitive interface described in Embodiments A1 to A10 where apparatuses are brought into proximity of each other to trigger an action.

Meanwhile the RFID tag described in Embodiments A1 to A10 is assumed to be a HF RFID tag in a band of 13.56 MHz though this is not a limit for the present invention . HF RFID has a feature of short distance communication within about several ten cm though depending on output . For instance the HF RFID tag is widely used in applications that intuitively trigger an action by bringing two terminals close to each other such as electronic money and ticket gate systems. This being so for example when the user wants to display photographs captured by a digital camera on a TV the user brings the digital camera close to the RFID reader writer of the TV thereby realizing an entity interface where an entity camera and an entity TV operate in conjunction with each other or an intuitive interface where digital camera photographs are displayed on the TV.

In this embodiment the HF RFID tag is added to the apparatus device as in Embodiments A1 to A10 and also the UHF RFID tag is added to the package or the returnable container of the apparatus to ensure product traceability even after the product is reached the use environment of the consumer.

Though this embodiment describes the case where the apparatus is a recorder the apparatus is not limited to such and may be any of a digital home appliance a food and the like.

An apparatus M assembled in a manufacturing line is provided with a HF RFID tag M. The HF RFID tag M has a memory which has a structure of a dual interface that is accessible from both the apparatus M and a communication unit of the RFID tag M. A product serial number of the apparatus and a program command for copying the product serial number of the apparatus to the UHF RFID tag are stored in the memory of the HF RFID tag M in an assembly stage.

After the assembly of the apparatus M is completed prior to packaging a handy reader writer M reads the product serial number from the memory of HF RFID and also records a device ID of UHF RFID UHF RFID unique information indicating that the UHF RFID tag is added to the package or the like.

Next having packaged the apparatus M a UHF RFID tag M is added to a package M. The UHF RFID tag M may be directly added to the package or may be added to a management table or the like. After adding the UHF RFID tag M the handy reader writer M records the product serial number and the like read from the HF RFID tag M of the apparatus M to the UHF RFID tag M. In this embodiment the handy reader writer M is capable of accessing both HF RFID and UHF RFID.

Thus the product serial number of the apparatus M is recorded on the HF RFID tag M and the same information is also recorded on the UHF RFID tag M of the package M. Therefore in distribution after packaging there is no need to read the product serial number and the like from the HF RFID tag that is capable of only short distance access. By simultaneously passing a plurality of products through the gate the information can be directly read from the UHF RFID tag. This contributes to more efficient distribution.

Moreover after the apparatus M reaches the use environment of the consumer the HF RFID tag can be read by a remote controller of a TV and the like. Hence not only the distribution but also the apparatus reaching the consumer can be traced. As a result overall traceability that contributes to improved distribution efficiency and prevents accidents caused by aged deterioration during apparatus use can be achieved.

The memory of the UHF RFID tag M stores a UHF device ID HF existence identification information an apparatus product serial number and actual article number a date a manufacturer a model number lot number and product name and a status .

The UHF device ID is stored in a non rewritable area of the memory and is identification information for uniquely identifying the UHF RFID tag. The UHF device ID is read by the handy reader writer before the apparatus M is packaged and recorded in the HF RFID tag M. Hence even when the correspondence relation between the package and the apparatus is wrong the correspondence relation can be checked beforehand and appropriate processing can be performed.

The HF existence identification information is identification information for determining whether or not the HF RFID tag M is added to the apparatus M. In the case where the HF RFID tag M is added to the apparatus M when recording the product serial number and the like read from the HF RFID tag M to the UHF RFID tag M upon apparatus packaging the HF RFID existence identification information is changed to information indicating exist . This makes it possible to determine whether or not to check the correspondence relation between UHF RFID and HF RFID by referencing only the HF existence identification information .

The apparatus product serial number and actual article number is at least one of the product serial number read from the HF RFID tag M and an actual article number associated with the product serial number. The actual article number is a number of the apparatus used in the distribution process. It is possible to uniquely associate the actual article number with the product serial number by equally managing the product serial number and the actual article number. Accordingly in this embodiment the product serial number and the actual article number are not clearly distinguished from each other but are described as the same information.

The date corresponds to a manufacturing year month date and information of a date and time of manufacture of the apparatus M is recorded as the date . This information may be recorded by the handy reader writer M at the time of recording the product serial number to the UHF RFID tag M or manufacturing year month date information stored in the HF RFID tag M may be read and recorded to the UHF RFID tag M.

The manufacturer is identification information of a manufacturer of the apparatus M. This information may be recorded by the handy reader writer M at the time of recording the product serial number to the UHF RFID tag M or manufacturer information stored in the HF RFID tag M may be read and recorded to the UHF RFID tag M.

The model number lot number and product name may be recorded by the handy reader writer M or the corresponding information may be read from the HF RFID tag M and recorded in the same way as the date and the manufacturer . Regarding the lot number in the case where lot management from manufacture to distribution can be conducted in a unified fashion the information may be written by any of the two methods. However in the case where unified management is not conducted and manufacturing line information is unclear upon packaging reading the lot number from the HF RFID tag M and recording it to the UHF RFID tag M is more advantageous because stricter management can be achieved.

The status is status information in the distribution form. That is status information necessary for tracing the apparatus such as factory storage factory shipment distribution center reception distribution center shipment and retailer reception is recorded as the status . The status is rewritable in each distribution process.

Moreover the UHF RFID tag M stores management server specific information . The management server specific information is the same information as the server specific information in the second memory of the HF RFID tag M. When packaging the apparatus M the server specific information is read from the HF RFID tag M and copied to the UHF RFID tag M. This enables unified management to be performed by the same management server for both of the management in the distribution stage using UHF RFID and the management after the apparatus is delivered to the consumer.

Therefore after the apparatus M is delivered to the consumer by reading the management server address information from the HF RFID tag M accessing the management server and making an inquiry by the apparatus product serial number trace information from manufacture to distribution managed by the management server can be visualized to the consumer. This enhances consumer assurance and safety.

First the HF RFID tag M is added to the assembled product the apparatus M . This flowchart shows an example where the HF RFID tag is added after the assembly of the apparatus M. However in the case of a structure of a dual interface where the apparatus and the HF RFID tag can both access a shared memory the HF RFID tag M is added to the apparatus M during assembly of the apparatus M.

Next the product serial number of the apparatus M is recorded on the HF RFID tag . This is a step of recording the product serial number on the HF RFID tag M in the assembly process through the handy reader writer M. The product serial number is obtained from a management server of the manufacturing line using the handy reader writer or the like and recorded on the HF RFID tag M by proximity wireless communication.

After the product serial number is recorded on the HF RFID tag M the apparatus M is packaged . The packaging mentioned here denotes packaging for distribution with a cushioning material and the like or containment into a returnable container and the like.

After completing the packaging the UHF RFID tag M is added to the package including a returnable container surface a management label and so on .

Following this the handy reader writer M communicates with a management server thereby reading the actual article number associated with the product serial number read from the HF RFID tag M . The actual article number is a management number used in product distribution and is issued by the management server. The actual article number is in a one to one correspondence with the product serial number.

After the actual article number is read from the management server the product serial number or the actual article number and the existence identification information indicating that the HF RFID tag M is added to the apparatus M are recorded on the UHF RFID tag M .

As a result of the above processing the product serial number recorded on the HF RFID tag M which is added to the apparatus M is copied to the UHF RFID tag M after apparatus packaging. Typically the communicable distance of the HF RFID tag is short and so it is difficult to access the HF RFID tag after packaging. In this embodiment however the product serial number or the actual article number is recorded on the UHF RFID tag that has a longer communicable distance than the HF RFID tag and is added to the package. This allows for apparatus distribution management after packaging.

Moreover even if the package or the like is discarded after the apparatus is delivered to the consumer the product serial number and the like can be read by accessing the HF RFID tag added to the apparatus. Thus unified management from distribution to consumer use can be achieved which contributes to traceability over a wide range.

First upon factory shipment of the apparatus M the product serial number or the actual article number is read from the UHF RFID tag M by using a handy reader writer or passing the product through a UHF RFID reader gate. Shipment completion is registered in the management server that can communicate with the handy reader writer or the UHF RFID reader gate and also the UHF RFID tag M is accessed from the handy reader writer or the UHF RFID reader gate to rewrite the status in the memory of the UHF RFID tag M to indicate shipment completion .

After factory shipment the product is retained in the distribution center or the like. Upon subsequent shipment from the distribution center the product serial number or the actual article number is read from the UHF RFID tag M by a handy reader writer or a UHF RFID reader gate and distribution center shipment completion is registered in the management server and also the status in the UHF RFID tag M is rewritten to indicate distribution center shipment completion .

Likewise upon retailer shipment retailer shipment completion is registered in the management server and the status in the UHF RFID tag M is rewritten to indicate retailer shipment completion .

Lastly when the apparatus M reaches the consumer the product serial number is read from the HF RFID tag M by the reading unit of the RF ID reader writer of the TV remote controller or the like and registered in the management server in association with TV identification information . Accordingly in this embodiment too the server specific information is recorded in the second memory of HF RFID beforehand. The server specific information in this embodiment indicates the management server and includes a URL for connecting to the management server . Hence by reading the HF RFID tag M of the apparatus M using the TV remote controller or the like having the RF reader writer management information from manufacture to distribution can be obtained from the management server . In addition by managing the product serial number in association with the TV identification information in the management server it is possible to store a list of apparatuses possessed by the user in the management server in association with the user s TV without managing personal information of the user.

When the user s apparatus has a problem a message warning the user is adequately displayed on the TV with it being possible to prevent a serious accident.

As described above according to this embodiment in the manufacturing stage the apparatus and the package are respectively provided with the HF RFID tag and the UHF RFID tag which each carry existence identification information of the other tag. Moreover the product serial number and the management server specific information stored in the HF RFID tag are copied to the UHF RFID tag. As a result it is possible to provide a system in which management can be performed even after the apparatus reaches the consumer while maintaining distribution management convenience unlike a conventional system where traceability is attained only during distribution.

Though this embodiment describes management from manufacture to delivery to the user the present invention has the same advantageous effects even when the user discards or recycles the apparatus. A procedure in this case can be realized in the same way as in this embodiment.

For example in upon factory shipment the product serial number and the like recorded on the HF RFID tag M added to the apparatus M are copied to the UHF RFID tag M added to the package M after packaging. The same applies to shipment to a disposal facility or shipment to a recycling center other than factory shipment. In the case of shipment to a disposal facility after disposal completion disposal completion is registered in the management server. This enables unified management to be performed while the product is manufactured used by the consumer and put into disposal. Recently there is a problem of illegal disposal due to disposal cost. However referencing HF RFID or UHF RFID of an illegally disposed apparatus makes it instantly clear in which part of the distribution stage the illegal disposal has been conducted. Thus the problem of illegal disposal can be alleviated according to this embodiment.

In the case of shipment to a recycling center since use status information a problem detection status a total use time and the like detected by the use status detection unit are recorded in an area accessible from the HF RFID tag such information can be used for determination of whether or not the apparatus is recyclable price determination and so on. When the apparatus is determined as recyclable information such as TV identification information or personal information managed in the management server in association with the product serial number may be updated and put to use.

A semi transmissive mirror transmission plate is attached to a mirror unit in a bathroom. A display a power antenna and a RF antenna unit are arranged on a back surface of the mirror transmission plate. The user has a mobile terminal with a RF antenna and displays some kind of video information on the mobile terminal. A procedure of moving this video to the display of the mirror is described below.

In the case where a video source is a TV and the apparatus is connected to a TV antenna TV channel information and a TV image reproduction display time are transmitted to the apparatus via the antenna. The apparatus displays video of the TV channel on the screen. The image is not horizontally flipped in the case of TV.

Upon receiving a power supply enable flag from the terminal the apparatus supplies power to the terminal.

Referring back to the previous step in the case where the apparatus is connected to the Internet a video rate and resolution are set according to the attribute information of the apparatus and a server address optimal for the settings a server ID on a DLNA network a stream ID in a server and stream reproduction display time information are transmitted to the apparatus via the RF antenna.

Referring to a flowchart of the apparatus displays the stream so as to be synchronous with the display time of the video stream being displayed on the terminal on the basis of the server IP address the stream ID and the stream reproduction display time. Once the synchronization has been established the apparatus switches from the previous display to the next display that is the video on the terminal is seamlessly passed to the apparatus.

In the case where simultaneous display of the video on the terminal and the apparatus is prohibited for copyright protection when the video display on the apparatus starts seamlessly the video display on the terminal is stopped by means such as transmitting a video stop instruction from the apparatus to the terminal.

Moreover when the apparatus receives from the terminal a mirror flip identifier for horizontally flipping the video on the mirror display the apparatus horizontally flips the video in the next step. Meanwhile horizontal flip of characters is not performed.

According to the above method first the terminal supplies power to the apparatus and activates the apparatus when the apparatus is not in operation. This benefits power saving. After this once the apparatus has started operation then the apparatus supplies power to the terminal. In the case where the terminal receives video data from a server or the like and distributes the video to the apparatus via a network the terminal needs to transmit the video for a long time via an access point by wireless LAN. When transmitting a large amount of data by wireless LAN power consumption is high and there is a possibility that the battery level of the terminal becomes 0. However this embodiment provides an advantageous effect of preventing battery drain by supplying power from the apparatus to the terminal. Moreover the mirror shows a reversed image of a human figure. For example as in the case of a video instruction for toothbrushing leaning effectiveness decreases because right and left are reversed. However this embodiment facilitates leaning by horizontal flipping the image.

A communication device according to Embodiment B of the present invention is described in detail below with reference to drawings.

The communication device is a communication device e.g. the communication device mobile phone terminal Y in a mobile phone M in a mobile device N in see the mobile communication device in that reads terminal device information e.g. information YD in information YU in see the appliance information in from a terminal device e.g. the terminal device Y in a refrigerator M or a microwave M in an air conditioner NJ in see the appliance in by proximity wireless communication communication by an IC tag or the like communication within a distance of several centimeters see the proximity wireless communication in and transmits the read terminal device information to a server the server Y in a registration server M in see the server in via a general purpose network e.g. a network YN in the Internet M in the communication device including a terminal device information obtainment unit an antenna Y in see the appliance information obtainment unit in that obtains the terminal device information the information YD the information YU from the terminal device by the proximity wireless communication the terminal device information including at least terminal device identification information e.g. a product serial number YN in a product serial number YUn in for identifying manufacturing information of the terminal device a communication device information storage unit a memory Y see a memory in that stores communication device information information YD including at least communication device identification information e.g. a product serial number YN in for identifying manufacturing information of the communication device an information adding unit the information adding unit Y see the transmission unit in that adds the stored communication device information the information YD to the obtained terminal device information the information YD the information YU to generate transmission information information YD in see the transmission information in to be transmitted to the server and a communication unit the communication unit Y in see the transmission unit that transmits the generated transmission information the information YD to the server via the general purpose network wherein the communication unit specifies the server based on the terminal device information e.g. an address YUa of the server Y obtained from the terminal device and communicates with the specified server.

According to this structure even in the case where the device apparatus appliance Y is the microwave M or the like the information the product serial number YN of the communication terminal Y of the user of the user who purchased the device Y can be easily transmitted to the server Y.

Moreover even in the case where the device Y is the microwave M or the like the device Y stores the address YUa or the like for specifying the server Y and transmits the stored address YUa or the like. The address YUa or the like is obtained from such a device Y and transmitted to the appropriate server Y specified by the obtained address YUa or the like. This ensures that the information is transmitted to the appropriate server Y.

Besides the input of the address YUa via a keyboard is unnecessary so that the information can be easily transmitted to the server Y.

A home network is established in each of houses M M and M see the home in . Each of the home networks is connected to a registration server M via the Internet M. That is each of the home networks is formed in the house the house M M M corresponding to the home network.

If services provided via a home network are limited within a corresponding house the registration server M may exist in the house. It is also possible that a home network is divided into various places such as a vacation house and an office and that a plurality of home networks are used in a single house such as a dormitory or a room sharing house.

It is assumed that in a house there are home appliances which are always connected to the Internet M hereinafter referred to as always connected home appliances and home appliances which are not always connected to the Internet M hereinafter referred to as non always connected home appliances . The always connected home appliances such as TVs M and M a DVD recorder M and the like are connected to the Internet M via a router M or a wireless Access Point AP M see the access point in . The non always connected home appliances such as a digital camera M a microwave M and a refrigerator M are indirectly connected to the Internet M as needed.

For example there may also be appliances always connected home appliances connected to a device such as the access point M other than a mobile phone M and appliances non always connected home appliances not connected to the other device.

In Embodiment B1 a mobile terminal such as the mobile phone M is also a terminal included in the home network.

The devices in Embodiment B1 can perform simple data communication with each other by using a proximity wireless communication device. Each of the devices obtains information of other device using the proximity wireless communication device and registers the obtained information into the registration server M using a home network device.

A communication device M according to Embodiment B1 of the present invention is assumed to have two devices for communication.

One communication device is a proximity wireless communication device M which is typically a device of Near Field Communication NFC or RF tag see for example a RF ID reader writer in .

The other communication device is a home network communication device M. Examples of the home network communication device M are a wireless communication device using wireless Local Area Network LAN or ZigBee which is used in connecting home appliances to each other a wired communication device using Ethernet or Power Line Communication PLC and a communication device using WiMAX or Third Generation Partnership Project 3GPP which is used in mobile devices see for example a relay device in .

The communication device M also includes a user interface IF device M. The user IF device is for example an input device such as buttons a display and an output device using a Light Emitting Diode LED or the like. For devices such as TVs and air conditioners data input output is generally performed by using a remote controller that is physically separated from the device. For convenience of the description such a remote controller is also considered as the user IF device M in Embodiment B1 of the present invention.

A device UID obtainment unit M in the communication device M obtains information including device UID see the product serial number in for identifying a registration device M that is a device to be registered see the appliance in .

Here the registration device M transmits a registration command and registration information including device UID of the registration device M to the communication device M by using the proximity wireless communication device M .

A registration information generation unit M obtains the registration information including the device UID from the device UID obtainment unit M and obtains home ID from a home ID management unit M. Then the registration information generation unit M adds the home ID to the registration information obtained from the registration device M to generate registration information.

If position information is to be added to the registration information the registration information generation unit M obtains the position information from a position information obtainment unit M see the position information obtainment unit in .

Examples of the position information are address information based on a post code inputted to a TV geographical position information generated by a Global Positioning System GPS of a mobile phone and the like. For instance the position information may be information see the position information in of such accuracy that at least indicates a position of one home out of positions positions P and P of a plurality of homes e.g. homes and in . If position information of the registration device M is registered the registered position information can be used to easily provide services to improve home appliance traceability or the like. A registration information transmitting receiving unit M see the transmission unit in performs transmission reception of the registration information see the transmission information in .

The home ID management unit M manages home ID see that is different from communication device ID used by the communication device included in the above described home network.

In conventional home networks a master device of each communication device manages information such as IDs for the communication device. The management method is different depending on a type of the corresponding communication device. Therefore it is not possible to manage information on home by home basis. Although there is a situation where ID is inputted by a user for each service this results in quite low usability. In Embodiment B1 introduction of new different ID that is home ID makes it possible to manage pieces of information of devices included in a home network without using a communication device or services.

When the home ID management unit M registers information of a device to the server at the first time the home ID management unit generates home ID.

The home ID may be generated based on position information or UID of the communication device. It is also possible to generate home ID based on a random number to check whether or not the generated home ID does not overlap with any other ID in the registration server. It is further possible that a user sets the home ID.

When the registration information transmitting receiving unit M see the transmission unit in in the communication device M receives registration information from the registration information generation unit M the registration information transmitting receiving unit M transmits the received registration information to the registration server M see the server in using the home network communication device M .

The registration server M compares the received registration information to pieces of information stored in the registration database M to determine whether or not the received registration information can be registered. Then the registration server M sends a registration response back to the communication device M.

In receiving the registration response the registration information transmitting receiving unit M notifies the user of a result of the determination by using the user IF device M .

If the registration server M determines that the received registration information cannot be registered the registration information transmitting receiving unit notifies the determination to the registration information generation unit M in order to request change of the registration information. Thereby it is possible to collectively manage devices in a home network including white goods that do not have user IF devices for communication.

The communication device M receives the registration command and the device UID M and determines whether or not the communication device M has home ID M .

If the communication device M does not have the home ID NO at M then the communication device M obtains home ID the processing is referred to as home ID obtainment M .

On the other hand if the communication device M has the home ID YES at M the communication device M generates information of the communication device to be registered into the communication device M itself hereinafter referred to as registration information or home ID M .

Next the communication device M transmits the registration information to the registration server M M .

The communication device M determines whether or not the communication device M receives a response registration response to the transmitted registration information from the registration server M M . If the response is not received NO at M then the communication device M presents a user with a registration failure notification for notifying a failure of the registration processing M and terminates the registration processing.

On the other hand if the communication device M receives the response YES at M then the communication device M presents the user with an inquiry asking whether or not to register the generated information into the communication device M M . If the user replies OK YES at M then the communication device M completes the registration processing. If the user replies NO NO at M the communication device M returns to the home ID obtainment. When it is difficult to obtain home ID the registration processing is terminated as a failure.

The communication device M determines whether or not the communication device M has a function of automatically generating home ID hereinafter referred to also as an automatic generation function M . If the communication device M has the function YES at M then the communication device M automatically generates the home ID. On the other hand if the communication device M does not have the function NO at M the communication device M asks the user to manually input the home ID.

If there is no method for manually inputting home ID or the user refuses to the manual input failure at M then the communication device M notifies the user of a failure of the registration processing M to persuade the user to obtain the home ID by any different method.

When the communication device M automatically generates home ID YES at M the communication device M selects an appropriate automatic generation function M .

If the communication device M can obtain geographical position information by a GPS or the communication device M is a terminal such as a TV for which an address as position information has been generally registered the communication device. M generates the home ID using the position information M .

If the communication device M is a terminal generally set in a house the communication device M generates the home ID using a unique identifier of the communication device M M .

Especially if it is difficult to generate effective home ID the communication device M generates the home ID using a random number M .

After generating the home ID the communication device M transmits the home ID to the server M . Then the communication device M receives information regarding the generated home ID from the server and thereby determines whether or not the home ID can be used M . If it is determined that the home ID cannot be used NG at M then the communication device M returns to the processing of generating the home ID.

On the other hand if the home ID can be used OK at M then the communication device M asks the user whether to not to register the generated home ID into the communication device M itself M . If the user replies OK YES at M then the communication device M registers the home ID into the communication device M itself M . Otherwise NO at M the communication device M returns to the processing of generating the home ID.

The registration device M transfers a registration command and information including device UID for identifying the registration device M to the communication device M via the proximity wireless communication device.

If the communication device M does not have home ID the communication device M generates provisional home ID and transmits the generated provisional home ID to the registration server M via the home network communication device.

The registration server M sends a response with information regarding the provisional home ID to the communication device M. On the other hand if the communication device M has home ID or if the communication device M receives from the registration server M home ID that is allowed by the registration server M to be used the communication device M transmits the home ID and the registration information including the device UID to the registration server M thereby completing the registration of information of the registration device M.

In Embodiment B2 of the present invention a configuration in which the home ID is shared among communication terminals communication devices is described.

Communication devices MS and MR see the mobile communication device in included in a home network share the same home ID using a home network M and the home network communication devices M MS MR . The communication devices MS and MR may share the home ID using the proximity wireless communication devices M.

Note that as in the above example of M MS MR the term xxxx is used as a collective term for xxxxS and xxxxR .

The communication device according to Embodiment B2 hereinafter referred to as a transmitting communication device MS can share the home ID with another communication device hereinafter referred to as a receiving communication device MR in the same house by transferring a sharing command and home ID to the receiving communication device via the proximity wireless communication devices M see .

In the transmitting communication device MS a home ID sharing unit MS in a home ID management unit MS provides the sharing command and the home ID that is held in a home ID storage unit MS to a proximity wireless communication device MS.

For example when the proximity wireless communication device MS of the transmitting communication device MS is moved into proximity of a proximity wireless communication device MR of the receiving communication device MR information is transferred between them. Thereby the home ID in the transmitting communication device MS is stored into the proximity wireless communication device MR of the receiving communication device MR.

If a home ID storage unit MR in the receiving communication device MR does not hold any home ID a home ID sharing unit MR in the receiving communication device MR stores the received home ID into the receiving communication device MR itself.

On the other hand if the home ID storage unit MR already holds home ID the receiving communication device MR transmits both the held home ID and the received home ID to the registration server M. In receiving both home IDs the registration server M manages both home IDs virtually as a single home ID.

The registration server M may notify both communication devices of one of the home IDs to unify them. Even in this case the registration server M manages both home IDs virtually as a single home ID since there are non always connected devices in the home network.

It is possible that ID of a non always connected device is updated every time of being connected to the home network and the virtual management by the registration server M ends when updating of all of the registration devices namely devices to be registered which are included in the home network are completed. Thereby it is possible to unify originally plural home networks into a single network.

When a communication device is to be connected to the home network M and a home network connection detection unit MS of the communication device detects that the communication device does not hold home ID the communication device broadcasts a request for home ID sharing to terminals connected to the home network M.

Terminals holding home ID among the terminals connected to the home network M transmit the home ID to the communication device.

Here if a master terminal to respond to requests for home ID sharing is previously selected from among terminals holding the home ID it is possible to prevent that a device requesting home ID sharing receives responses from a plurality of terminals thereby overburdening the home network. If there is no response the communication device terminal requesting home ID sharing may obtain home ID by itself.

When the receiving communication device MR receives a sharing command and home ID M the receiving communication device MR determines whether or not the receiving communication device MR holds home ID M .

If the receiving communication device MR does not hold home ID NO at M then the receiving communication device MR registers the received home ID as home ID into the receiving communication device MR itself M .

On the other hand if the receiving communication device MR holds home ID YES at M the receiving communication device MR compares the held home ID to the received home ID.

If the held home ID is identical to the received home ID identical at M the receiving communication device MR terminates the processing without any further processes.

On the other hand if the held home ID is not identical to the received home ID different at M the receiving communication device MR selects home ID M .

The selection of home ID may be performed by the receiving communication device MR or the registration server.

In the situation where the receiving communication device MR asks the registration server to perform the selection the receiving communication device MR transmits the held home ID and the received home ID to the registration server as sharing information M . Thereby the receiving communication device MR receives from the registration server a sharing response including home ID selected by the registration server M . Then the communication device MR inquiries the user whether or not to share register the selected ID into the communication device MR M . If the user replies OK YES at M the registration processing is completed. It the user replies NO NO at M the received ID receiving communication device MR returns to the processing for selecting home ID.

In the case where the receiving communication device MR itself selects the held home ID the receiving communication device MR transmits the held home ID as home ID and the received home ID as sharing home ID to the registration server M .

The registration server notifies updating of the home ID to other communication devices already sharing home ID.

In the situation where the receiving communication device MR selects the received home ID then the receiving communication device MR updates the held home ID by the received home ID M . In addition the receiving communication device MR transmits the previously held home ID as sharing home ID and the received home ID as home ID to the registration server M . The registration server notifies updating of the home ID to other communication devices already sharing home ID.

After transmitting a sharing command and home ID to the registration server the transmitting communication device MS determines whether or not a response to the home ID sharing is received from the registration server M . If there is no response NO at M the transmitting communication device MS terminates the processing. On the other hand if the response including a notification of updating home ID is received YES at M the transmitting communication device MS updates the home ID by the notified home ID M and completes the processing.

The transmitting communication device MS transmits home ID A to the receiving communication device MR by using the proximity wireless communication device. The receiving communication device MR transmits home ID B that is held in the receiving communication device MR itself and the received home ID A to the registration server M. The registration server selects the home ID B from the received home IDs and notifies the home ID B to a communication device holding the home ID A and the receiving communication device MR to cause the devices to register the home ID B.

The transmitting communication device MS detects connection to the home network M and broadcasts a request for home ID sharing to terminals in the home network M . If a response to the request for home ID sharing is received YES at M the transmitting communication device MS registers home ID received with the response into the transmitting communication device MS itself M . On the other hand if the response is not received NO at M the transmitting communication device MS performs the home ID obtainment M .

After receiving the request for home ID sharing M the receiving communication device MR determines whether or not the receiving communication device MR itself is a master terminal selected in the home network M . If the receiving communication device MR is the master terminal YES at M then the receiving communication device MR transmits home ID held in the receiving communication device MR itself in response to the request M . On the other hand if the receiving communication device MR is not the master terminal NO at M then the receiving communication device MR does not perform any processes. Here if a master terminal is not selected from terminals holding home ID the receiving communication device MR responds to all requests for home ID sharing from any terminals without the determination regarding the master terminal.

When a communication device detects connection to a home network the communication device broadcasts a request for home ID sharing to terminals in the home network. Only a communication device M selected as the master terminal from among communication devices receiving the request responds to the request. The communication device receiving the response registers home ID received with the response into the communication device itself.

A communication device according to Embodiment B3 of the present invention is described in detail with reference to the drawings. The communication device according to Embodiment B3 of the present invention reads terminal device information regarding a terminal device from the terminal device by using a NFC function and transfers the terminal device information to a server via a general purpose network.

The terminal device Y see the appliance in is a device having a NFC function RF ID unit IC tag or NFC tag emulation . The terminal device Y is for example an electronic terminal device such as a refrigerator a microwave a washing machine a TV or a recording device see for example . The terminal device Y has an internal memory for holding as terminal device information see the information YD a product serial number see the product serial number YN that is ID for identifying the terminal device Y use history information of the terminal device Y error information and the like.

The communication device Y see the mobile communication device in has a NFC function for communicating with the NFC function of the terminal device Y by proximity wireless communication. The communication device Y includes a reader writer function of reading the terminal device information from the terminal device Y. The communication device Y is for example a portable device such as a mobile phone or a remote controller terminal of a TV.

The server Y see the server in is a server connected to the communication device Y in order to communicate with the communication device Y via a general purpose network such as the Internet see the Internet M in . The server Y includes a database DB for accumulating the terminal device information that is read from the terminal device Y to the communication device Y.

The terminal device Y includes a CPU Y a failure sensor unit Y a use history logging unit Y a memory Y a modulation unit Y and an antenna Y.

The CPU Y is a unit that controls a system of the terminal device Y. The CPU Y controls the failure sensor unit Y the use history logging unit Y the memory Y and the modulation unit Y which are units included in the terminal device.

The failure sensor unit Y is a unit that detects a location and detail of a failure occurred in each unit included in the terminal device Y. A piece of failure information detected by the failure sensor unit Y is accumulated in a RAM in the memory Y. The detected failure information is represented by an error code that is uniquely defined depending on a location and condition of the failure.

The use history logging unit Y is a unit that performs logging for each piece of use history information every time the terminal device Y is operated by the user. The use history information applied with logging is accumulated into the RAM Y in the memory Y. In general when use history information is used to examine how a failure has occurred several pieces of use history information up to occurrence of the failure have high priorities of being examined. Therefore it is desirable that the use history logging unit Y according to Embodiment B3 uses the RAM Y as First In First Out FIFO to chronologically accumulate new pieces of use history information into the RAM Y. Moreover when use history information is used to examine how a failure has occurred it is desirable that several pieces of use history information up to a timing detected by the failure sensor unit Y are stored as priorities into the RAM. Therefore if when five minor failures are detected in using the terminal device Y several pieces of operation use history information up to the five failures are stored as priorities.

The ROM Y previously stores at least the product serial number YN for uniquely identifying the terminal device Y when the terminal device Y has been shipped. The user of the terminal device Y cannot update the information previously held in the ROM Y.

The product serial number is desirably information by which a manufacturer a manufacturing lot number and a manufacturing date of the terminal device Y can be determined.

It is also desirable that the ROM Y is embedded in a semiconductor chip of the CPU Y. This structure prevents information during memory access to be easily inspected. Therefore secret key information for authentication and encrypted communication in proximity wireless communication with the communication device can be recorded on the ROM Y when shipping.

The RAM Y is a rewritable memory in which the failure information detected by the failure sensor unit Y and the use history information applied with logging of the use history logging unit Y are accumulated.

The modulation unit Y is a unit that modulates communication data for proximity wireless communication with the communication device Y. The modulation method varies depending on employed NFC standard. For example Amplitude Shift Keying ASK Frequency Shift Keying FSK Phase Shift Keying PSK and the like are used.

The antenna Y generates electromagnetic induction from radio waves emitted from an antenna of the communication device Y. The antenna Y performs at least processing of providing power to the modulation unit Y and the memory Y to be operated. In addition the antenna Y overlaps reflected waves of the radio waves emitted from the communication device Y with signals modulated by the modulation unit Y to transmit the terminal device information that is stored in the memory Y to the communication device Y.

As described above the terminal device according to Embodiment B3 detects failures occurred in each unit included in the terminal device. Then the terminal device performs logging for use histories to accumulate the use histories into the memory. Then if the terminal device is moved into proximity of the communication device Y to be capable of performing proximity wireless communication with the communication device Y the terminal device can transmit the terminal device information the information YD stored in the memory into the communication device Y.

Next the communication device Y according to Embodiment B3 is described. It should be noted that the subject of Embodiment B3 is the communication device Y.

The communication device Y includes an antenna Y a CPU Y a demodulation unit Y a memory Y a position information determination unit Y see the position information obtainment unit in a GPS antenna Y a communication memory Y an information adding unit Y and a communication unit Y.

The antenna Y performs polling for calling any terminal devices in order to search for a terminal device communicable with the communication device Y by proximity wireless communication.

In receiving a response to the polling the antenna Y establishes proximity wireless communication with the responding terminal device Y to receive modulated terminal device information the information YD from the terminal device Y and provides the modulated terminal device information to the demodulation unit Y.

In general the polling processing is always necessary even if there is no terminal device communicable with the communication device Y by proximity wireless communication. This consumes power. Therefore the communication device Y is provided with a switch not shown for controlling a timing of start of polling so that polling processing is performed when the switch is turned ON. This structure can significantly shorten a time period of the polling. As a result the power consumption amount can be considerably reduced. This is especially efficient when the communication device Y operates by a limited power source such as a battery.

The CPU Y is a unit that controls a system of the communication device Y. The CPU Y controls operations of each unit included in the communication device Y.

The modulation unit Y is a unit that demodulates data modulated by the modulation unit Y of the terminal device Y. The demodulated terminal device information is temporarily stored into the memory Y.

The ROM Y is a memory that cannot be rewritten by the outside. The ROM Y previously holds a product serial number the product serial number YN for uniquely identifying the communication device Y when the communication device Y has been shipped.

The product serial number is desirably information by which a manufacturer a manufacturing lot number and a manufacturing date of the communication device Y can be determined.

It is also desirable that the ROM Y is embedded in a semiconductor chip of the CPU Y. This structure prevents information during memory access from being easily inspected. Therefore secret key information for authentication and encrypted communication in proximity wireless communication with the terminal device Y can be recorded on the ROM Y when shipping.

The RAM Y holds the terminal device information of the terminal device Y which is received by the antenna Y and demodulated by the demodulation unit Y. As described earlier the terminal device information includes the product serial number for uniquely identifying the terminal device Y the use history information of the terminal device Y and failure codes.

The position information determination unit Y is a group of sensors for determining a location of the communication device Y. The position information determination unit Y includes a latitude longitude positioning unit GPS Y an altitude positioning unit Y and a position correction unit Y.

The position information determination unit Y does not need to always determine a location of the communication device Y location information if the location information is generated at a timing where the communication device Y becomes communicable with the terminal device Y using the antenna Y. As a result power consumption of the communication device Y can be reduced.

The latitude longitude positioning unit Y is a general Global Positioning System GPS that receives radio waves from satellites to perform 3 dimensional positioning of the earth see a GPS device in .

The altitude positioning unit Y is a general altimeter. The altitude positioning unit Y may be any various altimeters such as an altimeter receiving radio waves to extract an altitude an altimeter detecting an air pressure to measure an altitude and the like. The altitude positioning unit Y is provide to the communication device Y so that an altitude can be detected even in a building where GPS cannot receive radio waves.

The position correction unit Y is a unit that corrects a value measured by the GPS to generate more accurate position information. In general when radio waves from satellites cannot be received in a room or the like the GPS cannot generate correct position information. Therefore the position correction unit Y includes an electronic compass and a 6 axis acceleration sensor. The electronic compass is used to detect a direction in which the communication device Y moves and the acceleration sensor is used to detect a speed of the movement. Thereby it is possible to correct position information generated by the GPS in a location where the GPS is difficult see the acceleration sensor in .

Regarding the information adding unit Y when the terminal device information that has been provided from the terminal device Y and stored into the memory Y is to be transmitted to the server Y the information adding unit Y adds a the product serial number of the communication device Y that is stored in the ROM Y in the memory Y and b the position information information YD measured by the position information determination unit Y to the terminal device information.

This enables the server Y to determine which communication device transmits the terminal device information where the transmitting terminal device is located for example and then manage the results of the determination.

For example if a manufacturer of the terminal device finds that the terminal device has a possibility of causing serious accidents troubles the information in the database of the server Y allows the manufacturer to determine where the terminal device is. Thereby the possibility of causing serious accidents can be reduced. As a result it is possible to increase sense of safety and security of the user using the terminal device.

Furthermore when the communication device Y has a display function as mobile phone terminals have the above described terminal device information generated by the information adding unit Y makes it possible to determine with which communication device the terminal device having a possibility of accidents can perform proximity wireless communication and thereby display a notification of the possibility of accidents troubles in the terminal device on the communication device Y. Thereby even if such a terminal device generally does not have any display function and is not connected to a general purpose network it is possible to transmit a notification of the accident possibility of the terminal device to the communication device Y in order to warn the user using the terminal device. As a result it is also possible to provide a terminal device that can increase sense of safety and security of the user using the terminal device.

The communication unit Y is a unit that communicates with the server Y via the Internet by using general LAN wireless LAN or mobile phone network. Thereby the communication unit Y transmits to the server Y the terminal device information added with the product serial number and the position information of the communication device Y as the communication device information. Here the added terminal device information is further added with a MAC address and an IP address to be transmitted to the server Y.

The server Y is connected to the communication device Y via a general purpose network such as the Internet. The server Y includes a device management database DB for managing the terminal device information.

The device management DB Y stores the terminal device information information Y in association with the communication device information see information Y in . In the device management DB Y according to Embodiment B3 the communication device information is managed as parent device information and the terminal device information is managed as child device information in association with the parent device information. The child device information is added with the position information generated by the communication device in order to manage further information indicating where the terminal device is the position of the terminal device Y .

As described above in the system according to Embodiment B3 the terminal device information the information YD is read from the terminal device the terminal device Y by the communication device the communication device Y using proximity wireless communication. The communication device is touched to the terminal device to communicate with the terminal device to obtain the terminal device information. The communication device adds the product serial number YN and position information information YD of the communication device at the time when the proximity wireless communication is enabled to the obtained terminal device information and transmits the generated information to the server. Thereby the server can manage the communication device information as parent device information in association with the terminal device information as child device information see .

Therefore if a manufacturer of the terminal device finds that the terminal device would cause serious accidents the manufacture can easily recall the terminal device the terminal device Y or display a notification of a possibility of the serious accident on a display unit of the communication device the communication device Y . As a result it is possible to achieve traceability of the products the terminal device Y and to provide the users of the products with safety and security.

First the communication device Y performs polling to the terminal device Y to establish proximity wireless communication SY .

In terms of power consumption amount of the communication device it is desirable as described earlier that a switch operated by a user is provided so that the polling is performed while the switch is being pressed or the polling starts when the switch is pressed SY .

Next the terminal device Y sends a response to the polling to the communication device Y in order to establish proximity wireless communication with the communication device Y SY .

At this timing the position information determination unit Y of the communication device Y generates position information of a current position to be used as position information of the terminal device Y.

The generation of the position information is not limited to be performed only in completion of the polling. The position information may be generated any time while the proximity wireless communication is established after the response to the polling. It is important to determine the position of the terminal device Y at a high accuracy by generating position information of the position where proximity wireless communication which can be performed when a distance between communicating devices is only several centimeters is established.

After the establishment of the proximity wireless communication at SY mutual authentication between the terminal device Y and the communication device Y is performed using general public key cryptography and also key sharing is temporarily performed to share cryptography keys generated by the terminal device Y and the communication device Y between the devices SY . After that while the proximity wireless communication is established data on the communication path is encrypted using the cryptography keys to communicate between the devices. As a result tapping of the data can be prevented.

After completing the key sharing the terminal device Y transmits the terminal device information recorded on the memory Y of the terminal device Y to the communication device Y SY .

When the communication device Y receives the terminal device information from the terminal device Y the communication device Y stores the received terminal device information into the memory Y of the communication device Y SY .

When the communication device Y completes receiving of the terminal device information from the terminal device Y the communication device Y issues a connection request to the server Y SY .

The server Y responds to the connection request of SY to establish communication with the communication device Y SY .

After establishing communication between the communication device Y and the server Y the communication device Y adds the communication device information of the communication device Y to the terminal device information of the terminal device Y to be transmitted to the server Y SY .

Here the communication device information includes for example a product serial number of the communication device Y position information of the communication device Y when proximity wireless communication with the terminal device Y is established an e mail address of the user registered in the communication device Y if any a connection account to the server Y registered in the communication device Y if any and the like.

The communication device Y may obtain from the terminal device Y information see for example the address YUa in for specifying the server Y from among a plurality of computers servers such as an address of the server Y and communicate with the server Y specified by the obtained information.

After adding the communication device information to the terminal device information at SY then the communication device Y transmits the terminal device information added with the communication device information see the information YD in to the server Y SY .

The server Y registers the terminal device information added with the communication device information received from the communication device Y into the device management DB Y. Thereby the processing is completed.

Thereby the server Y can manage pieces of information regarding devices for each house by managing information of each terminal device Y which establishes proximity wireless communication with the communication device Y touching the terminal device Y in association with identification information product serial number or the like of the communication device Y.

In addition for the position information registered as information of a position at which the terminal device is equipped position information indicating a position where proximity wireless communication is established between the communication device Y and the terminal device Y is used. Since the proximity wireless communication according to Embodiment B3 is performed at common High Frequency HF of 13.56 MHz the communication is possible when a distance between communicating devices is within several centimeters. Therefore if the position information detected in establishing proximity wireless communication is set to be position information of the terminal device a maximum error is several centimeters which results in assuring an enough accuracy to achieve traceability of the products.

For example a data structure of the device management DB Y may correspond to the structure illustrated in . See also according to need.

When the user intends to perform user registration or the like for a terminal device using the communication device Y in purchasing the terminal device the following processing is performed. The user equips the terminal device and touches the terminal device by the communication device Y. Thereby terminal device information of the terminal information is provided to the communication device Y using proximity wireless communication. The communication device Y adds the communication device information of the communication device Y to the terminal device information in order to be transmitted to the server Y.

In receiving the terminal device information added with the communication device information the server Y manages the terminal device information as child device information and the communication device information as parent device information in association with each other in the device management DB.

For example in the device management DB terminal device information of a terminal device for example a microwave Y terminal device information of a terminal device for example a washing machine Y and terminal device information of a terminal device for example a TV Y all of which are touched by a communication device Y are managed in association with a product serial number of the communication device Y. Each of the terminal device information includes whereabout information longitude latitude altitude and the like and use status information use histories error codes use time periods and the like .

Thereby the server Y can manage pieces of information of devices for each house because the communication device Y touches these terminal devices. As a result traceability of the terminal devices can be achieved.

Furthermore the communication device generates position information when proximity wireless communication with the terminal device is established and uses the generated position information as position information of the terminal device. Therefore it is possible to register a position of the terminal device with an error of several centimeters which is a distance capable for proximity wireless communication between devices. Since the GPS in the communication device is used to generate the position information of the terminal device each terminal device does not have a GPS thereby reducing a cost.

Here the communication device Y may include a display unit Yin where each display screen YS is displayed by the display unit Y

First the description is given for the situation where the communication device Y touches the terminal device Y to register information of the terminal device Y into the server Y.

When the user operates the communication device Y to start up a reader writer application of the communication device Y the communication device Y displays on a display screen a message persuading the user to touch the terminal device Y for proximity wireless communication Y .

When the communication device Y touches the terminal device Y proximity wireless communication is established between the devices. The communication device Y reads terminal device information of the terminal device Y from the terminal device Y generates position information of a current position and provides the pieces of information to the memory in which the pieces of information are temporarily stored. Then the communication device Y establishes communication with the server Y and transmits the terminal device information added with communication device information of the communication device Y to the server Y.

The server Y determines whether or not the terminal device information has already been registered in the device management DB. If it is determined that the terminal device information has not yet been registered in the device management DB then the server Y causes the communication device Y to display on the display unit of the communication device Y a message asking the user whether or not to register information of the terminal device Y Y .

Next when the user selects to register the information of the terminal device Y the server Y causes the communication device Y to display a message asking the user whether or not to register position information of the terminal device. When the user selects to register the position information the server Y registers the position information associated with the terminal device information transmitted from the communication device Y to the server Y into the device management DB of the server Y as position information of the terminal device Y Y .

Next the description is given for the situation where the position information of the terminal device Y is different from the position information registered in the device management DB of the server Y.

When the user operates the communication device Y to start up a reader writer application of the communication device Y the communication device Y displays on the display screen a message persuading the user to touch the terminal device Y by the communication device Y to perform proximity wireless communication Y .

When the communication device Y touches the terminal device Y proximity wireless communication is established between the devices. The communication device Y reads terminal device information of the terminal device Y from the terminal device Y generates position information and transmits the terminal device information added with communication device information of the communication device Y to the server Y.

The server Y compares a a product serial number of the terminal device which is included in the received terminal device information to b a product serial number registered in the device management DB in order to examine whether or not information of the touched terminal device is already registered in the server Y. In addition the server Y extracts the position information from the received communication device information and examines whether or not the extracted position information is identical to the position information registered in the device management DB. Since the position information has an error of course the determination is made to compare the position information to a threshold value that has the order of several centimeters in other words the threshold value is a value corresponding to a distance between devices capable for proximity wireless communication . If it is determined that the extracted position information is different from the registered position information the server Y causes the communication device Y to display on the display unit a message notifying the user of the result of the determination Y .

Then the communication device Y displays on the display unit a message asking the user whether or not to update the position information of the terminal device Y to information of a current position of the terminal device Y Y .

If the user selects to update the position information the communication device Y registers the position information generated by touching the terminal device Y by the communication device Y into the device management DB of the server Y as new position information of the terminal device Y.

Therefore according to Embodiment B3 even if the position information that has been registered is changed because the terminal device Y is moved and equipped at a different location it is possible to update the position information to new position information that is generated by touching the terminal device Y by the communication device Y. Thereby an accuracy of traceability of the terminal device Y can be improved.

It is comparatively preferable to understand for example Embodiment B4 first among Embodiments A A1 to A13 and B B1 to B7 as noted earlier.

If the predetermined conditions are satisfied then the CPU N generates positional information including position information that is information of a current position of the mobile device N hereinafter referred to as current position information .

The positional information includes a second server login ID and a second server login password which are regarding the registration server N and b current position information. The second server login ID and the second server login password are previously obtained in purchasing the product and stored in a memory not shown . The current position information is obtained from the position information storage unit N.

The transmission unit N transmits the positional information to the registration server N via the communication I F unit N in .

The receiving unit N in the registration server N receives the positional information via the communication I F unit N.

The communication unit N in the registration server N confirms the second server login ID and the second server login password in the received positional information.

If the second server login ID and the second server login password are correct then the communication unit N provides the positional information to the product control unit N.

The product control unit N provides the second server login ID to the position information generation unit N.

According to instructions from the product control unit N the position information generation unit N obtains pieces of product information as illustrated in b in from the product information management unit N based on the second server login ID. Then the position information generation unit N generates a product map from pieces of position information of the respective products. The product map shows positions of the products in the house illustrated in . The position information generation unit N provides the generated product map to the product control unit N.

The product map is a 3D map or 3D product map in which illustrations of the products are arranged at positions based on the respective pieces of position information.

The product control unit N controls the products from the TV NA to the FF heater NK by using a the current position information of the mobile device N included in the positional information and b the product map or home appliance map generated by the position information generation unit N.

In this example the product control unit N turns ON a product at a position closest to the current position information received from the mobile device N without turning ON products at other positions . See for example described later according to need. Here the product control unit N generates product control information including an instruction for turning ON the air conditioner NJ.

The first product control information includes part number ID of the air conditioner NJ UID of the air conditioner NJ and a product control command for turning ON the air conditioner NJ.

The communication unit N designates an address of the mobile device N to be a designation of the first product control information.

As described above according to Embodiment B4 of the present invention proximity wireless communication of RF ID technology and position information are used to manage in the registration server N positions of products each having the RF ID unit N. Thereby it is possible to automatically control the products according to a current position of the mobile device N.

Regarding the position information information detected by the 6 axis sensor N motion sensor that measures relative position information is used as position information. Therefore it is possible to update the position information by using the detected results of the 6 axis sensor N when the mobile device N is outside an area in which the GPS N can perform positioning. As a result correct position information can be obtained even outside the area.

It should be noted that the mobile device N according to Embodiment B4 has been described to have the GPS N and the 6 axis sensor N but the mobile device N is not limited to the above described structure. For example the mobile device N may have only the 6 axis sensor N.

In this aspect the product information management unit N in the registration server N stores pieces of relative position information of products which are relative to a reference point position information of the TV NA which is first registered as illustrated in .

Here a product map generated by the position information generation unit N has axes of an x coordinate a y coordinate and a z coordinate as illustrated in .

It should also be noted that it has been described in Embodiment B4 that a part number ID and UID of a target product which are stored in the RF ID unit N of the target product and b position information of the mobile device N are registered to the registration server N but the present invention is not limited to the above. For example if the registration server N receives again server registration information regarding a product for which registration has already been completed the registration server N may perform processing as illustrated in .

Referring to the table includes a accuracy identifiers for identifying an accuracy of position information b part number ID in association with each accuracy identifier and c processing to be performed when position information in re received server registration information is different from position information registered in the product information management unit N.

If the registration server N determines based on the part number ID and the UID included in the re received server registration information that the position information has already been registered in the product information management unit N then the registration server N checks the part number ID. If the part number ID indicates a TV a BD recorder or an FF heater the registration server N updates the position information in the product information management unit N to the position information in the re received server registration information.

If the part number ID indicates an air conditioner a solar panel or a fire alarm then the registration server N notifies the mobile device N of the position information stored in the product information management unit N. The mobile device N thereby corrects current position information of the mobile device N based on the position information received from the registration server N.

It should also be noted that shows the two kinds of accuracy identifiers but the accuracy identifiers are not limited to the two kinds. It is possible to set more than two kinds of accuracy identifiers for respective different processing.

It should also be noted that the product control unit N in Embodiment B4 is included in the registration server N but the present invention is not limited to the structure. For example the product control unit N may be included in the mobile device N so that the product control unit N obtains a product map from the registration server N to control products. Besides in the mobile device N the product control unit N may also be included in a home server not illustrated that is connected to the home network N. In this aspect the mobile device N transmits position information to the home server and obtains a product map from the home server.

It should be noted that the mobile device N according to Embodiment B4 is connected to the registration server N via the home network N and the external network N by using the communication I F unit general purpose I F unit N but the present invention is not limited to the above. For example the mobile device N may have a function of serving as a mobile phone so that the mobile device N can be connected to the registration server N via at least a mobile phone network for example Long Term Evolution LTE by using an interface connectable to the mobile phone network in stead of the communication I F unit N see . Furthermore the mobile device N may have an interface connectable to a circuit network such as WiMAX so as to be connected to the registration server N via at least the WiMAX network. Any other networks can be used to connect the mobile device N to the registration server N.

It should also be noted that in Embodiment B4 the product map generated by the position information generation unit N is used to determine how to control products but the present invention is not limited to the structure. For example image data of the product map generated by the position information generation unit N is transmitted to the mobile device N that displays the image data on the display unit N.

It should also be noted that in Embodiment B4 the position information generation unit N generates the product map based on the information illustrated in b in but the present invention is not limited to the above. For example pieces product information of products located near the position information of the mobile device N in the same house are detected from the product information management unit N and then used to generate a product map regarding nearby products in the house. In this aspect the product control unit N performs product control by combining the product map of and the product map of nearby products. For instance it is assumed in Embodiment B4 that the TV NA which is the farthest from the mobile device N is turned OFF but there is a solar panel near the mobile device N in the house. Under the assumption the product control unit N controls the TV NA to be turned ON for example.

It should also be noted that in Embodiment B4 the product information management unit N in the registration server N stores part number ID UID and position information of each product but the present invention is not limited to the above. For example it is also possible that a power state ON or OFF is obtained in real time from each product via the communication I F unit N of the product and then managed in the product information management unit N. The product control unit N thereby controls power of the TV NA located the farthest from the mobile device N to be kept ON when the predetermined number of products are powered OFF although it has been described n the above description that the product control unit N turns OFF the TV NA.

It should also be noted that in Embodiment B4 the product control unit N turns OFF a product located the farthest from the mobile device N and turns ON a product closest to the mobile device N. However the present invention is not limited to the above.

The product control unit N may control power to be turned ON or OFF for a plurality of products based on the position information of the mobile device N.

It should also be noted that in Embodiment B4 the product control unit N turns OFF a product located the farthest from the mobile device N and turns ON a product closest to the mobile device N. However the present invention is not limited to the above. For example it is also possible that the CPU N in the mobile device N stores position information as a movement history into a memory not illustrated and regularly provides the movement history to the registration server N. In this aspect the registration server N estimates from the movement histories of the mobile device N which product is located in which room or which floor and manages results of the estimation. It is further possible that the product control unit N controls power to be turned ON or OFF for each product in the same house based on the estimation results. For example if it is estimated from the movement histories that the TV NA and the air conditioner NC are located in the same room the product control unit N turns OFF the air conditioner NC when the TV NA is turned OFF.

In addition to the moving histories it is also possible to obtain a time of switching ON or OFF each product thereby estimating which product is in the same room or the same floor.

It should also be noted that in Embodiment B4 the product information management unit N manages the product information illustrated in or and the position information generation unit N generates the product map illustrated in or . However the present invention is not limited to the above. For example it is also possible that image data of a room arrangement created by the user is transmitted from the mobile device N to the registration server N and therefore managed by the product information management unit N. In this aspect the position information generation unit N generates a product map as illustrated in by combining a product information illustrated in or and b the image data of the room arrangement.

Here private information such as the image data see for example an image generated by an image generation unit described later of room arrangement may be applied with encryption different from encryption employed for the product information and then transmitted from the mobile device N to the registration server N.

It is also possible that private information such as the image data of room arrangement is transmitted to a server different from the server receiving the product information and a product map is generated with reference to the different server when the registration server N generates the product map.

It should also be noted that Embodiment B4 may be combined with any other embodiments.

Then the mobile device O transmits to the first server O a the product information received from the RF ID device O and b the position information generated by touching the RF ID device O by the mobile device O to perform proximity wireless communication which are in association with each other. The first server O can manage the information of the mobile device O as parent device information and the information of the product having the RF ID device O as child device information in association with each other. In addition if relative positions of such products having the RF ID devices O are calculated using pieces of the position information of the products the relative positions can be used to generate a 3D map of the products.

In addition the system includes the second server O having a database in which a room arrangement and coordinates of each building are managed. The room arrangement and coordinates are combined with pieces of position information of products which are managed in the first server O. Thereby it is possible to generate a 3D map 3D product map of the products having the RF ID devices O arranged in each building.

Moreover the mobile device O can correct the current position information of the mobile device O by using a the reference coordinates and the building coordinate information which are generated from the registered coordinates received from the RF ID device O b the position information generated by the position information unit O and c the information generated by the direction information unit O.

The following describes processing of registering the product information of the product having the RF ID device O into the first server O.

If the mobile device O touches the RF ID device O to be able to perform proximity wireless communication with the RF ID device O the mobile device O supplies power to the RF ID device O that thereby starts operating.

With the power supply the RF ID device O modulates the product ID O the first server URL O the service ID O and the accuracy identifier O. The RF ID device O then transmits the modulated pieces of information to the mobile device O.

In receiving the product ID O the first server URL O the service ID O and the accuracy identifier O by the antenna O the mobile device O demodulates the received pieces of information in the RF ID device O.

The URL unit O extracts the first server URL O and provides the extracted first server URL O to the communication unit O.

The coordinate accuracy identification information O extracts the accuracy identifier O and provides the extracted accuracy identifier O to the determination unit O.

The RF ID detection unit O provides the coordinate information sending unit O and the reference coordinate unit O with a trigger for notifying of the receipt of the pieces of information from the RF ID device O.

In receiving the trigger the coordinate information sending unit O provides the communication unit O with the position information of the mobile device N which is received from the position information output unit O.

Here the description is given for the position information of the mobile device O outputted by the position information output unit O

First the absolute coordinate calculation unit O receives a a result of integrating by the integrator O results detected by the angular velocity sensors O to O and b a result of integrating by the integrator O results detected by the acceleration sensors O to O.

In the absolute coordinate calculation unit O the position information correction unit O and the direction information correction unit O correct the results of the integrators O and O by using the information stored in the position information unit O and the information stored in the direction information O. The information stored in the position information unit O is a calculation result of the position information calculation unit O using the satellite antenna O. The information stored in the direction information O is a direction indicated by the magnetic compass O

Next the absolute coordinate calculation unit O provides the corrected direction information in the direction information unit O and the corrected position information in the position information unit O.

The position information output unit O generates position information from the corrected direction information in the direction information unit O and the corrected position information in the position information unit O.

By the above described processing the mobile device O eventually generates position information current position information of the mobile device O.

Then the program execution unit O provides the product ID and the service ID which are stored in the RF ID storage unit O to the communication unit O.

The communication unit O generates data information including a the position information provided from the coordinate information sending unit O and b the product ID and the service ID provided from the program execution unit O. The communication unit O designates the first server URL notified from the URL unit O to be a destination address of the data and provides the data and the address to the transmission unit O. The transmission unit O modulates the data and transmits the modulated data to the first server O via the communication antenna O.

The registered coordinate information unit O stores the information of the mobile device O as parent device information and the information of the RF ID device O as child device information in association with each other. In more detail the product ID O and the service ID O which are information of the product having the RF ID device O child device are managed in association with the position information of a position at which the mobile device O parent device receives the product ID O and the service ID O from the RF ID device O.

The following describes processing performed by the mobile device O to generate a 3D map of products a 3D product map . Each of the products has the RF ID device and has been registered by the mobile device O onto the first server O.

In a living room on the first floor a TV OA a BD recorder OB and an air conditioner OC are arranged. In a Japanese room on the first floor an air conditioner OD is arranged. On the second floor a TV OE and an air conditioner OF are arranged. Each of the above products is embedded with the RF ID device O.

It is assumed that coordinates of a position of each product have already been registered to the registered coordinate information unit O connected to the first server O by using the mobile device O employing the above described processing for registering product information stored in the RF ID device O.

First the communication unit O in the mobile device O generates product information request data to be used to request the first server O to provide the product information registered by using the mobile device O.

The transmission unit O modulates the product information request data and transmits the modulated data to the first server O via the communication antenna O.

In receiving the product information request data the first server O generates product information response data and transmits the generated data to the mobile device O. The product information response data includes the child product information that managed in association with the mobile device O as its parent device.

In this example the product information response data includes the product ID O the service ID and the position information regarding each of the TV OA the BD recorder OB the air conditioner OC the air conditioner OD the TV OE and the air conditioner OF.

Based on the position information of each product included in the product information response data the second server O extracts from the building coordinate database O image data including position coordinate information of a building hereinafter building coordinate information located at the same position as that of each product.

The building coordinate information includes an image of a room arrangement and position information of a building.

The receiving unit O in the mobile device O receives the product information response data via the communication antenna O then modulates the received information and provides the modulated information to the communication unit O.

The program execution unit O generates image data of a 3D map of products as illustrated in using the position information of each of the products which is information included in the product information response data. In the 3D map the products are mapped as different icons on respective coordinates based on the corresponding position information so that the user can learn the arrangement of the products at a glance.

The data processing unit O provides the image data to the memory unit O in which the image data is temporarily stored.

The display unit Odisplays image data of the 3D map of products illustrated in which is stored in the memory unit O.

Next in receiving the building coordinate information from the second server O via the communication antenna O the receiving unit O in the mobile device O demodulates the received building coordinate information and provides the demodulated information to the building coordinate information output unit O.

The building coordinate information output unit O analyzes the building coordinate information and provides the building coordinate information to the display unit O

The display unit Odisplays image data of a 3D product map as illustrated in . The displayed image data is a combination of the image data of and the already displayed image data of .

As described above it is possible to generate a 3D product map which the user having the mobile device O can see an arrangement of products at a glance.

Next the description is given for the processing performed by to the mobile device O to correct the position information of the mobile device O by using the building coordinate information.

It is assumed in this example that product information of the air conditioner OD in is to be registered to the first server O.

Here the processing until when the first server O receives data including product ID and service ID from the mobile device O is the same as the processing described previously and therefore is not explained again below.

In receiving the product information of the air conditioner OD the first server O transmits the position information of the air conditioner OD to the second server O.

The second server O extracts from the building coordinate database O the building coordinate information of corresponding to the position information of the air conditioner OD. Then the second server O transmits the extracted building coordinate information to the first server O.

If the product to be registered is a product usually fixed to a wall or somewhere such as an air conditioner the first server O compares a the position information of the air conditioner that is indicated in the building coordinate information to b the position information of the air conditioner that is generated by the mobile device O. If the position information of the air conditioner that is generated by the mobile device O is not close to a wall the first server O transmits to the mobile device O the position information hereinafter referred to also as building coordinate information of the air conditioner that is indicated in the building coordinate information.

In receiving the building coordinate information the receiving unit O in the mobile device O demodulates the building coordinate information and provides the demodulated information to the building coordinate information output unit O. The building coordinate information output unit O determines based on the building coordinate information and the position information of the air conditioner that the current position information of the mobile device O is to be corrected. Then the building coordinate information output unit O provides the building coordinate information to the position information correction unit O.

The position information correction unit O corrects the current position information of the mobile device O based on the building coordinate information provided from the building coordinate information output unit O.

Next the mobile device O registers information of the air conditioner OD into the first server O in association with the corrected current position information of the mobile device O.

As described above a the position information of the air conditioner that is indicated in the building coordinate information is compared to b the position information of the air conditioner that is generated by the mobile device O. Thereby it is possible to determine whether or not b the position information of the air conditioner that is generated by the mobile device O is deviated from a correct position. As a result the position information of the mobile device O can be corrected.

It should be noted that it has been described that the first server O receives the building coordinate information from the second server O for the determination. However the present invention is not limited to the above. For example it is also possible that the mobile device O obtains the building coordinate information from the second server O before transmitting information to be registered to the first server O and that the mobile device O compares the building coordinate information to the position information of the air conditioner OD to determine whether or not the position information of the mobile device O is to be corrected.

Next the description is given for the processing performed by the mobile device O to correct the position information of the mobile device O by using the accuracy identifier.

It is assumed that the product information of the air conditioner OC in has already been registered to the first server O and the mobile device O touches the air conditioner OC.

When the mobile device O receives via the antenna O the product ID O the first server URL O the service ID O and the accuracy identifier O from the RF ID device O of the air conditioner OC the RF ID unit O in the mobile device O demodulates these pieces of information.

At this stage the mobile device O does not know whether the product information of the air conditioner OC has already been registered in the first server O. Therefore the mobile device O transmits to the first server O data including the position information of the mobile device O the product ID and the service ID by the product registration processing as described previously.

If the registered coordinate information unit O determines that the product information of the air conditioner OC has already been registered then the first server O generates data including the position information of the air conditioner OC that is registered in the registered coordinate information unit O and then transmits the generated data to the mobile device O.

When the receiving unit O in the mobile device O receives the position information of the air conditioner OC via the communication antenna O the receiving unit O demodulates the received position information and provides the demodulated information to the registered coordinate unit O.

The registered coordinate unit O extracts the position information from the data including the position information of the air conditioner OC and provides the extracted position information to the determination unit O.

The determination unit O determines whether or not the position information received from the registered coordinate unit O is to be reference coordinates based on the accuracy identifier O of the RF ID device O received from the coordinate accuracy identification information O.

Regarding the accuracy identifier O the RF ID device O is previously assigned with an accuracy identifier for identifying each different product as illustrated in .

If the determination unit O determines that the position information of the mobile device O is to be corrected then the determination unit O provides the position information received from the registered coordinate unit O to the reference coordinate unit O.

Here if the accuracy identifier O represents a low accuracy then the mobile device O determines that it is not necessary to correct the position information of the mobile device O. Then the mobile device O notifies the determination result to the first server O. The first server stores the new position information of the air conditioner OC into the registered coordinate information unit. Thereby the processing is completed.

If there is a trigger from the RF ID detection unit O the reference coordinate unit O provides the position information received from the registered coordinate unit O to the position information correction unit O.

The position information correction unit O corrects the current position information of the mobile device O based on the position information received from the reference coordinate unit O.

Next the mobile device O notifies the first server O of that the position information is completed. Thereby the processing is completed.

As described above a the position information indicated in the building coordinate information is compared to b the position information generated by the mobile device O. Thereby it is possible to determine whether or not b the position information generated by the mobile device O is deviated from a correct position. As a result the position information of the mobile device O can be corrected thereby preventing unnecessary updating of the position information.

Furthermore products which are usually not moved from an initial equipped location are designated in a group of products having a high accuracy of the position coordinates. Thereby reliability of the accuracy can be improved.

If even position information of a product in the group having a high accuracy is deviated from a correct position more than predetermined times it is possible not to correct the position information newly generated by the mobile device O but to correct the position information registered in the registered coordinate information unit O.

It should be noted that it has been described that the mobile device O determines based on the accuracy identifier whether or not the position information is to be corrected. However the accuracy identifier may be transmitted to the first server O so that the first server O determines the necessity of the correction.

Next the description is given for processing performed by the mobile device O to manage relative positions of the products.

Here product registration is first performed for the TV OA. Then with reference to the position information of the TV OA as a reference point relative position information is generated for the BD recorder OB that is registered next.

When the mobile device O receives via the antenna O the product ID O the first server URL O the service ID O and the accuracy identifier O from the RF ID device O of the TV OA the RF ID unit O in the mobile device O demodulates these pieces of information. The coordinate information sending unit O in the mobile device O provides the recording unit O with the position information determined in detecting the RF ID device O.

In receiving the position information the recording unit O records the received position information onto the position information storage unit O.

After that in the same product registration processing as described earlier the mobile device O registers the product information of the TV OA into the first server O.

When the mobile device O receives via the antenna O the product ID O the first server URL O the service ID O and the accuracy identifier O from the RF ID device O of the BD recorder OB the RF ID unit O in the mobile device O demodulates these pieces of information.

The coordinate information sending unit O in the mobile device O provides the recording unit O with the position information determined in detecting the RF ID device O of the BD recorder OB.

The recording unit O does not record the position information of the BD recorder OB onto the position information storage unit O because the position information of the TV OA has already been recorded.

In receiving the position information from the coordinate information sending unit O the relative position calculation unit O obtains the position information of the TV OA from the position information storage unit O via the reproducing unit O.

Next the relative position calculation unit O calculates relative position information of the BD recorder OB which is relative to a reference position or a reference point that is the position information of the TV OA obtained via the reproducing unit O. Then the relative position calculation unit O stores the calculation result into the position information recording unit.

By the above described processing it is possible to generate relative position information of a product with reference to a position of a different certain product.

It should be noted that it has been described that relative position information is stored in the mobile device O. However the present invention is not limited to the above. It is also possible that the mobile device O transmits relative position information to the first server O that manages the received relative position information in the registered coordinate information unit O.

It should also be noted that it has been described that the position information of the TV OA for which product registration is performed at the first time is set to be the reference position. However the present invention is not limited to the above.

For example a position predetermined by the user may be set to be the reference point reference position . For instance the reference point may be a position of an entrance of a building. If the mobile device O is a remote controller terminal of a TV a position of the TV may be the reference point.

In Embodiment B5 the position information storage unit O in the mobile device O holds relative position information. However the present invention in not limited to the above. For example the following aspect is also possible. The coordinate information sending unit O in the mobile device O provides position information generated by the mobile device O to the recording unit O every time the position information is generated. The recording unit O thereby records the position information onto the position information storage unit O. The position information storage unit O accumulates the position information generated by the mobile device O. In this aspect the program execution unit O generates trajectory information of the mobile device O from pieces of the position information accumulated in the position information storage unit O. Thereby a travel of the mobile device O can be estimated form the trajectory information.

It should be noted that it has been described in Embodiment B5 that the processing of the determination unit O is performed based on the two kinds of accuracy identifiers in . However the present invention is not limited to the above. For example the following is also possible. Two or more kinds of product classification are set. A threshold value is defined for each kind of the classification to represent a different size of deviation from the position information. Based on the threshold value the determination unit O determines whether or not to correct the position information of the mobile device O.

It should also be noted that Embodiment B5 may be combined with any other embodiments of the present invention. For example it is also possible that the function of the communication device MS according to Embodiment B2 is provided to a product having the RF ID device O and the 3D map 3D product map as well as home ID are shared among products within the same house. In this aspect each product obtains the 3D map beforehand from the mobile device O using the NFC function.

It should also be noted that it has been described in Embodiment B5 that the RF ID device O is provided to TVs BD recorders air conditioners and the like but the present invention is not limited to this.

Each of the products OG to ON also includes a specific small power wireless communication device for example ZigBee which enables the products to directly communicate with each other within a range in which radio waves can be received. It is assumed that each of the products OG to ON has already obtained a 3D map from the mobile device O via the RF ID device O. The 3D map shows an arrangement of the products OG to ON. Or for another method each of the products OG to ON may have the communication antenna O in order to obtain via the Internet the 3D map showing the product arrangement.

The following describes the situation where a product OH transmits data to a product OK by using the specific small power wireless communication device. The specific small power wireless communication device usually operates at a sleep mode in terms of power saving. At the sleep mode a power source of the specific small power wireless communication device is switched ON or OFF at regular intervals. Here timings of switching ON or OFF for the products are in synchronization with each other.

When the product OH needs to transmit data the specific small power wireless communication device in the product OH is switched to an awake mode. At the awake mode the power source of the specific small power wireless communication device is always ON.

The product OH examines the 3D map showing the arrangement of the products OG to ON which has previously been obtained. From the 3D map of the product arrangement the product OH determines products located between the product OH and the product OK. In this example a product O is determined from the 3D map to be a relay product to relay data.

When the product O receives the data addressed to the product OH the product O transfers the data to the OH. Then the product O is switched to the sleep mode.

As described above using the 3D map the product OH determines a relay product in order to transmit data and causes only the determined relay product product O to be switched to the awake mode. Thereby other products which do not need to be at the awake mode do not need to be switched to the awake mode. Without the 3D map in order to establish a path to the product OK the product OH needs to cause all products to be switched to search for the path.

It should also be noted that the embodiment of the present invention employs the 3D map that is a wireframe image of a house. However such house data is private information and 3D data is not generated for old buildings. Therefore until such 3D data becomes available for each general house it is necessary to obtain a room arrangement of a house without using 3D data of the house.

When there is no 3D data of a house an illustration is provided. In the illustration several air conditioners are arranged in a space that corresponds to the house. Without 3D data a room arrangement of a room having each of the air conditioners is not known.

Here each of the air conditioners which has a RF ID unit compliant to APE is provided with a detection unit such as an ultrasonic sensor or an infrared sensor for detecting a distance or a position. Thereby it is possible to determine a relative position of the air conditioner which is relative to walls and pieces of furniture in the room. Here a mobile phone which has the 3D mapping function as described in the embodiment of the present invention is brought into proximity of the RF ID unit in the air conditioner. At this moment the mobile device reads a product name a product serial number a MAC address and an authentication key from the RF ID unit. Then in transmitting these pieces of information to a server the mobile device also transmits to the air conditioner or the server 3D absolute coordinate information indicating the position of the mobile device. As a result of calibration using the previously described coordinate information of the relative position of the room and the absolute coordinate information it is possible to generate a 3D or 2D arrangement illustration of absolute coordinates of the air conditioner and the room. Combination of pieces of 3D coordinate information of the several air conditioners can result in coordinate information showing a 3D or 2D arrangement of the rooms having the air conditioners in the house in other words the wireframe image.

Since pieces of authentication data such as the MAC address and the authentication key which are used to be connected with other devices are also obtained it is possible to automatically perform connection authentication with the other devices such as TVs a DVD recorder and a refrigerator in the house via a network. This terminal is not necessary to be the air conditioner but also to be any electric and electronic devices in the house. Air purification device may be provided with a distance measuring sensor to server as the terminal. However the terminal is desirably a device such as an air conditioner which is equipped at a fixed location in a house because position coordinate information of such a device is not changed. In this example 3D coordinate information of only the rooms having the air conditioners can be generated. However since a user of the mobile device moves around in the house 3D trajectory information can be generated. The 3D trajectory information regarding position coordinates is analyzed and calculated by a server to estimate positions of entrances of the respective rooms positions of corridors and other positions. Thereby the 3D data showing the arrangement of the house is further developed. The above method can generate the 3D wireframe image of the house without 3D coordinate information of the house. Furthermore in the method by which the RF ID unit of the mobile device touches the RF ID reader at a front door of the house so as to unlock the key of the entrance if the position of the RF ID reader which is recorded onto the server or the RF ID reader has a high accuracy this means that an accuracy identifier of the position coordinates is high. The mobile device detects high accuracy by checking this. Therefore touching the RF ID unit the mobile device can calibrate absolute coordinates of the position of the mobile device. Thereby single touching can result in a locking unlocking of the key and b calibration of coordinates.

Note that the correction is performed based on the information in the direction information unit O as mentioned above. The direction information unit O may be information or a functional block for processing the information. The same applies to the other reference signs according to need.

A wireless home network is established in each of houses M M M and M. Each home network is connected to a registration server M via the Internet M.

In the case where services provided in the home network are limited within the corresponding house the registration server M may be located in the house see the server home server in .

In the assumed environment a radio wave range of each wireless AP M M M M M covers other homes and a TV M M M M a DVD recorder M M and a digital camera M in each home that connect to the Internet are physically connectable to a plurality of wireless APs.

Moreover in this embodiment a mobile terminal such as a mobile phone M is also a terminal included in the home network.

Each appliance device apparatus in this embodiment is capable of simple data communication with each other via a proximity wireless communication device and obtains information of another appliance via the proximity wireless communication device and registers the information in the registration server M via a home network device.

A communication device M see the mobile communication device in in this embodiment has two communication devices.

One communication device is a proximity wireless communication device M which is typically a device of Near Field Communication NFC or RF tag.

The other communication device is an Internet communication device M. Examples of the Internet communication device M include a wireless communication device of a wireless Local Area Network LAN ZigBee or the like used for connecting home appliances with each other a wired communication device of Ethernet Power Line Communication PLC or the like and a communication device of WiMAX Third Generation Partnership Project 3GPP or the like used in mobile devices.

The user IF device mentioned here is an input device such as buttons a display and an output device of a LED or the like.

A remote controller is typically used for input output of an appliance such as a TV or an air conditioner. Though physically separated from the device the remote controller is also regarded as a user IF device in this embodiment for simplicity s sake.

The communication device M further includes a position information obtainment device of GPS or the like capable of obtaining geographical position information of the terminal itself. Note that the advantageous effects of the present invention can further be enhanced by obtaining accurate position information through the use of a motion sensor and the like.

A wireless connection request obtainment unit M in the communication device M obtains a wireless connection request from a registration device appliance M at the same timing as obtainment of information including a device UID in Embodiment B1. This however does not apply in the case where wireless connection is not performed at the time of registration and later a request to connect to a wireless AP is made.

The registration device M transmits wireless connection request information including the wireless connection request and the device UID from a wireless connection request transmission unit M.

A wireless AP information request generation unit M obtains the wireless connection request information including the device UID and the wireless connection request from the wireless connection request obtainment unit M obtains a home ID from a home ID management unit M obtains position information from a position information obtainment unit M and generates a wireless AP information request.

The position information mentioned here is geographical position information that can be obtained by a GPS function of a mobile phone. Since the communication device M is very near the registration device M immediately after proximity wireless communication position information of the communication device M and position information of the registration device M can be regarded as substantially same position information.

This saves cost for equipping the registration device M with a position information obtainment device of GPS or the like.

A wireless AP information communication unit M receives the wireless AP information request from the wireless AP information request generation unit M and transmits the wireless AP information request to the registration server M.

Having received the wireless AP information request the registration server M transmits information of a wireless AP assumed to be nearest a position according to the position information included in the wireless AP information request and an authentication key for accessing the wireless AP.

Here information e.g. a MAC address position information of a wireless AP used in each home and a corresponding authentication key are already registered in a wireless AP information database M.

The registration may be performed by the wireless AP itself or by another device connected to the wireless AP.

For example the information of the wireless AP is a MAC address of the wireless AP and the authentication key is a WEP key in a wireless LAN.

The use of the home ID is intended to prevent a response indicating a wireless AP that is close in position but belongs to a different home. Meanwhile the use of the position information is intended to prevent a response indicating a wireless AP that corresponds to the home ID but is positionally hard to connect.

The wireless AP information communication unit M receives the information from the registration server M and transfers the received information to a setting program generation unit M.

The setting program generation unit M generates a program for causing the registration device M to automatically set access to the wireless AP based on the received information.

The program mentioned here is not merely information but an element that when received operates to automatically set access to the wireless AP.

This allows the user to complete the setting to the wireless AP without operating the registration terminal. Besides a manufacturer of the registration device does not need to equip the registration device with a user interface which requires a complex operation.

The communication device M transmits the program to the registration device M using the proximity wireless communication device M.

In this way even in the case where the registration device M is not yet set to connect to the Internet or the home network the program can be transferred securely.

A setting program execution unit M in the registration device M receives the program and transmits a packet necessary for the setting to the wireless AP M . The setting program execution unit M thus completes the setting.

The user who wants to wirelessly connect the registration device M such as the digital camera M transmits by proximity wireless communication a device UID of the registration device M and the wireless connection request to the communication device M that includes a device such as a GPS device capable of obtaining position information and is communicable with the registration server M.

The user adds his her home ID and position information to the device UID in the communication device M and transmits the resulting request to the registration server M.

Here the home ID may be inputted via the user IF device M in the communication device M or may be registered in the communication device M beforehand. Moreover an ID unique to the communication device M may be used as the home ID.

The registration server M returns information of an optimal wireless AP to be accessed by the registration device M and an authentication key necessary for the access based on the received information.

It is preferable that these information are transferred reliably and securely by for example a 3G Internet communication device in a mobile phone.

The communication device M adds a setting command for automatically completing setting of the registration device M to connect to the wireless AP to the received information. The communication device M transfers the resulting information to the registration device M using the proximity wireless communication device.

The registration device M automatically completes setting of a home network wireless communication device using the received authentication key.

The home network wireless communication device mentioned here is a device that is connectable from a plurality of devices in a specific range as in a wireless LAN ZigBee and the like and that requires authentication processing for connection. By receiving the authentication key from the registration server M through a secure reliable path the user can securely complete setting the connection to the wireless AP without performing a complex operation such as inputting the authentication key.

Upon receiving a registration request the communication device M determines whether or not the wireless connection request is included in the registration request M .

In the case where the wireless connection request is not included M NO the processing specific to this embodiment ends and the same processing as in Embodiment B1 is performed.

Note that this embodiment is also applicable in the case of receiving only the wireless connection request of an already registered device.

In the case where the wireless connection request is included M YES the communication device M generates the wireless connection request including the registration request and the position information M .

The communication device M transmits the generated wireless connection information to the registration server M M and waits for a response.

In the case where the communication device M is unable to receive the response M NO the communication device M notifies the user of a request failure M and ends the processing.

In the case where the communication device M is able to receive the response M YES the communication device M determines whether or not information of a wireless AP is included in the response M . In the case where the information of the wireless AP is not included M NO the communication device M notifies the user that there is no accessible wireless AP M and ends the processing.

Here a determination condition may be set in the wireless connection request. Moreover information of a plurality of wireless APs may be returned. This makes it possible to obtain a desired response for the user instead of merely receiving information of a near wireless AP. In the case where the information of the wireless AP is included M YES the communication device M generates a wireless AP setting program M and transmits the wireless AP setting program by proximity wireless communication M .

Embodiment B7 of the present invention describes a method of efficiently setting a channel of a wireless communication device. A wireless communication device for an existing home network autonomously performs channel setting so that the channel setting is carried out based on only local information obtained on the spot. In a situation where wireless communication is performed at all hours in many homes due to the emergence of a HEMS and the like such a setting method is inefficient. It is preferable to perform channel setting based on channel setting statuses of neighboring homes.

The registration server holds channel information and a cell radius in addition to information a MAC address a home ID position information an authentication key of each wireless AP see the processor in the access point in .

The position information may be position information of the wireless AP or information of a center point of home appliances in a home unit.

The cell radius is information indicating a range in which the home appliances as a whole interfere with their surroundings.

In an interference information transmission unit M and an interference information database M are added to the functions in Embodiment B6. The interference information transmission unit M transmits channel interference information of the surroundings of the terminal. This enables estimation of the existence of a device or a wireless AP not registered in the registration server M. By transmitting this information to the server it is possible to avoid a situation where channel setting using the server is less efficient than autonomous channel setting. A sequence for a channel setting request is the same as that for the wireless connection request. Based on the received information the registration server M selects a channel that has a lowest possibility of being the same channel as a neighboring home and transmits information of the channel. An algorithm of channel selection may be an algorithm that estimates future channel arrangement or an algorithm that selects only from current information.

As mentioned earlier the terminal device Y in is an electronic terminal device see for example the appliance in such as a refrigerator e.g. the refrigerator M in a microwave e.g. the microwave M or a washing machine.

The terminal device Y may be a type of terminal device e.g. the refrigerator M the microwave M that is typically not connected to the general purpose network YN the Internet M in unlike a TV e.g. the TV M in or the like connected to the Internet.

In the case where the manufacturer of the terminal device Y determines that the terminal device Y has a possibility of an occurrence of a trouble the device management DB Y in the server Y is referenced as mentioned earlier. As a result the manufacturer can learn where the terminal device appliance Y is the position of the terminal device Y a product serial number of a mobile phone terminal of the user using the terminal device Y which reduces a product recall time a time required for recalling the terminal device Y and prevents the occurrence of the trouble. This leads to safe and secure product use.

For example where the terminal device Y is means in which of a plurality of homes see the houses M to M in the terminal device Y is located or at which of a plurality of positions see for example in the home the terminal device Y is located see first position information and second position information described later .

There is also an instance where the communication device Y see the mobile communication device in has a display function as in a mobile phone terminal e.g. the mobile phone M in and the like. In such a case the following processing can be performed by detecting with which communication device appliance Y out of a plurality of communication devices Y of a plurality of users the terminal device Y having a possibility of a trouble can perform proximity wireless communication. That is the server Y or the like causes the corresponding communication device Y that can perform proximity wireless communication to display trouble information of the terminal device Y. Thus by transmitting the trouble information of the terminal device Y e.g. the refrigerator M the microwave M which typically has no display function and is not connected to the general purpose network to the communication device Y corresponding to the terminal device Y the user of the terminal device Y can be warned of the trouble. Hence the user of the terminal device Y can be provided with an appliance of enhanced safety and security i.e. the terminal device Y .

Therefore when the manufacturer determines that the terminal device Y has a possibility of a trouble the manufacturer can easily recall the terminal device Y or display the possibility of the trouble trouble information on the display unit e.g. the display unit Yin of the corresponding communication device Y. This contributes to higher traceability of the product the terminal device Y and provides the user with a safe secure appliance the terminal device Y .

In other words the following processing may be performed in this system. Here the following processing may be performed only in a certain situation. Note that the following processing is merely an example.

Devices home appliances white goods such as the refrigerator M and the microwave M are situated in a home see the house M in the home in .

For example the device Y see the terminal device Y in the appliance in is one of these devices including the refrigerator M and the like.

The home the house M in which the device Y is situated is the home of the user who purchased the device Y among a plurality of homes. That is the user of the device Y is a person in the home in which the device Y is situated among a plurality of persons in a plurality of homes.

This being so there is an instance where the manufacturer of the device Y or the like uses information see the transmission information in of the person who purchased the device Y i.e. the user of the device Y among information e.g. a name an address of the plurality of persons.

In detail in the case where the device Y is determined to have a possibility of a failure the manufacturer takes an action such as recalling the device Y or notifying the user of failure information according to the determination of the failure possibility of the device Y

Conventionally a phone number an address a name and the like of the user are used as such user information.

For example such user information is stored in the server Y see the registration server M in of the manufacturer.

In view of this when transmitting the user information to the server Y of the manufacturer or the like it is desirable that the user information can be easily transmitted without requiring a complex operation by the user.

In many occasions the user information may simply be the product serial number see the product serial number YN in of the communication device Y such as the mobile phone terminal e.g. the mobile phone M in of the user.

Moreover in recent years the communication device Y e.g. the mobile phone M in having a function of proximity wireless communication e.g. communication using a RFID or IC tag is often used in the home.

It is assumed that a communication device Y of a person see another home of a person who is other than a person in the home in which the appliance is installed and who has a mobile phone other than a mobile phone of the person in the home in not purchasing the device Y does not touch the device Y and so does not establish the proximity wireless communication with the device Y. Hence it is assumed that only the communication device Y of the user purchasing the device Y touches the device Y to establish the proximity wireless communication with the device Y.

This being the case the communication device Y may detect that the proximity wireless communication is established with the device Y the antenna Y in SY to SY in .

In the case where the establishment of the proximity wireless communication is detected information such as the product serial number YN in the communication device Y is transmitted to the server Y of the manufacturer of the device Y as the user information of the device Y with which the proximity wireless communication is established the communication unit Y SY in .

On the other hand in the case where the establishment of the proximity wireless communication is not detected the transmission of the information is suppressed.

Thus merely by purchasing the device Y and establishing the proximity wireless communication the user can easily transmit the information of the user purchasing the device Y to the server Y without a complex operation.

However since a plurality of devices Y are installed in the home there is an instance where a plurality of servers Y are provided by a plurality of manufacturers of the plurality of devices Y.

This raises a possibility that the information is transmitted not to an appropriate server Y but to an inappropriate server Y among the plurality of servers Y.

This can also lead to a situation where the user needs to input information see the address YUa in for specifying the appropriate server Y via a keyboard or the like.

In the case where the user purchased the device Y for example when the communication device Y of the user is brought to touch the device Y the distance between the device Y and the communication device Y of the user falls below a threshed e.g. several centimeters .

Here the refrigerator M the microwave M or the like the device Y may have the following function. In detail the device Y stores the information YD in the address YUa in for specifying the server Y of the manufacturer of the device Y from among the plurality of servers Y in the network YN even though the device Y is the refrigerator M or the like which is not connected to the network Y .

The device Y then transmits the stored information YD by the proximity wireless communication when the proximity wireless communication is established.

Meanwhile the communication device Y may perform the following processing in the case where the distance between the communication device Y and the device Y is less than the threshold the antenna Y in SY to SY in .

In other words the communication device Y may perform the following processing in the case where the proximity wireless communication is established between the communication device Y and the device Y.

That is the communication device Y may perform the following processing upon detecting the establishment of the proximity wireless communication.

When the establishment of proximity wireless communication is detected the communication device Y obtains the information YD the address YUa in described above for specifying the server Y of the manufacturer of the device Y from the device Y the refrigerator M or the like by the proximity wireless communication SY in .

The communication device Y then transmits to the server Y specified by the obtained information YD from among the plurality of servers Y the information the product serial number YN the information YD in the information Y in held in the communication device Y the memory Y as the information of the user of the device the device Y purchased by the user of the communication device Y and located relatively near the communication device Y the communication unit Y SY in .

For example the manufacturer of the device Y may use the received transmission information according to need and communicate e.g. by phone with the communication device Y having the information the product serial number YN as mentioned above.

In detail the transmitted information may be stored in the device management DB Y in the server Y of the manufacturer see for example .

Thus merely by purchasing the device Y and bringing the communication device Y within the distance of the threshold from the device Y the user can easily transmit the information the product serial number YN the information YD the information YD of the user purchasing the device Y to the server Y of the manufacturer of the device Y.

In addition the address YUa or the like is in transmitted from the device Y to the communication device Y by the proximity wireless communication. This ensures that the information is transmitted to the appropriate server Y specified by the obtained address YUa or the like from among the plurality of servers Y of the plurality of manufacturers.

Besides the information can be easily transmitted to the appropriate server Y with there being no need for the user to input the address YUa via a keyboard.

Here the transmission information YD including the product serial number YN of the communication device Y may further include other appropriate information such as the product serial number YN of the device Y located near the communication device Y in addition to the product serial number YN of the communication device Y.

In this case according to the transmission information YD the user of the communication device Y having the product serial number YN included in the information YD may be specified as the user of the communication terminal Y having the other product serial number YN.

The transmission information YD may also include the information YD indicating the position of the communication device Y.

The information YD may be information detected by a GPS Global Positioning System function. In detail the GPS function may be a function of the position information determination unit Y included in the communication device Y.

The position of the communication device Y indicated by the information YD the information YD is for example near the position of the device Y at a distance within the threshold e.g. within a distance of several centimeters .

In other words the information YD is information for specifying the position of the device Y relatively accurately. For example the position of the device Y may be specified more accurately than an address or a phone number of the home e.g. the house M in in which the device Y is installed. In detail the information YD may specify at which of a plurality of many positions e.g. the position of the air conditioner NJ the position of the air conditioner NC in in the house M the device Y is located.

This prevents to wrongly specify falsely recognize as the device Y e.g. the air conditioner NJ in another device e.g. the air conditioner NC located near the device Y such as at 3 to 5 meters. Accordingly the appropriate device the air conditioner NJ can be reliably specified as the device Y.

Hence there may be provided a communication device e.g. the communication device mobile phone terminal Y in the mobile phone M in the mobile device N in that reads terminal device information e.g. the information YD in the information YU the address YUa in from a terminal device e.g. the terminal device Y in the refrigerator M or the microwave M in the air conditioner NJ in by proximity wireless communication communication by an IC tag or the like and transmits the read terminal device information to a server the server Y in the registration server M in via a general purpose network e.g. the network YN in the Internet M in the communication device including a terminal device information obtainment unit e.g. the antenna Y in that obtains the terminal device information the information YD the information YU from the terminal device by the proximity wireless communication the terminal device information including at least terminal device identification information e.g. the product serial number YN in the product serial number YUn in for identifying manufacturing information of the terminal device a communication device information storage unit e.g. the memory Y that stores communication device information the information YD including at least communication device identification information e.g. the product serial number YN in for identifying manufacturing information of the communication device an information adding unit e.g. the information adding unit Y that adds the stored communication device information the information YD to the obtained terminal device information the information YD the information YU to generate transmission information e.g. the information YD in information including both the terminal device information the information YD and the communication device information the information YD as a result of the addition to be transmitted to the server and a communication unit e.g. the communication unit Y in that transmits the generated transmission information the information YD to the server via the general purpose network wherein the communication unit specifies the server based on the terminal device information e.g. the address YUa of the server Y i.e. the information for specifying from among a plurality of servers Y the appropriate server Y the server Y of the manufacturer of the terminal device to which the transmission information the information YD of the terminal device is to be transmitted the information being stored in the terminal device and transmitted from the terminal device obtained from the terminal device and communicates with the specified server.

According to this structure the communication device transmits the information YD to the server Y. Therefore the device Y e.g. the refrigerator M in can be realized by the above mentioned simple structure and may be a refrigerator the refrigerator M a home appliance white goods or the like which is not connected to the network YN. The information YD of the device Y can be reliably transmitted to the server Y regardless of the type of the device Y.

Moreover the communication device may further include a position information obtainment unit the position information determination unit Y in that obtains position information the information YD in of the communication device i.e. position information for specifying a position e.g. a position within several centimeters from the air conditioner NJ the device Y in of the communication device wherein the position information obtainment unit obtains the position information the information YD of the communication device at a timing when the proximity wireless communication between the terminal device and the communication device is established in the terminal device information obtainment unit the antenna Y and the communication device information the added communication device information the transmission information YD or part of the transmission information YD includes the position information the information YD of the communication device obtained by the position information obtainment unit at the above mentioned timing .

According to this structure even when the device Y communication terminal is merely a refrigerator e.g. the refrigerator M without a GPS function or the like the position of the device Y is specified by the information YD included in the information YD which is included in the transmitted information YD. Thus the position of the device Y can be reliably specified based on the information YD transmitted to the server Y regardless of the type of the device Y.

Besides the position can be accurately specified because the position is detected at a sufficiently close distance such as several centimeters over which the proximity wireless communication is performed see the air conditioners NJ and NC in mentioned above .

Moreover the added communication device information may include identification information e.g. the above mentioned home ID of a home e.g. the house M in which the communication device Y is installed or a person using the communication device Y the user of the communication device Y .

There may also be provided a management method of the terminal device the device Y i.e. information the product serial number YN of the terminal device in the server the server Y which is communicable with the communication device the communication device Y via the general purpose network the management method including obtaining the terminal device information the information YD the information YD after addition to which the communication device information the communication device identification information the information YD the information Y in is added SY in and searching a device management database the device management DB Y in of the server for the communication device identification information the product serial number YD included in the added communication device information specifying an appropriate part the product serial number YD from among a plurality of parts in the information wherein in the case where the communication device identification information obtained in the obtaining is determined to be not managed stored in the device management database as a result of the searching a new record see the information Y in of the added communication device information the information YD in is generated and associated with the terminal device information the information YD in the information Y the information Y to Y in obtained in the obtaining and also the communication device identification information the product serial number YN which is added to the information YD the information YD obtained in the obtaining is determined to be already managed in the device management database after the new record is generated the device e.g. the microwave M of the generated new record is determined to be a device whose communication device identification information is registered and wherein in the case where the terminal device information e.g. the information Y of the microwave M the device Y the product serial number YD in is not managed in the record see the information YD in including the communication device identification information the obtained terminal device information the product serial number Y the information Y i.e. at least one of parts other than the part corresponding to the added product serial number YN of the communication device Y is added to the record.

Setting necessary for a home network may be made in the server Y or another device by transmitting information in the above way. This enables the user to easily perform setting necessary for a home network without a complex operation.

Regarding mere details processing of any appropriate embodiment of the above embodiments is applicable. Regarding mere details other forms such as a form according to a known technique and a form according to improvement invention are also applicable.

Moreover a plurality of technical matters described in a plurality of different embodiments in different parts of this description may be combined according to need.

There may also be provided a method including a plurality of appropriate steps out of the steps described above an integrated circuit including a plurality of functions a computer program causing a computer to execute the plurality of functions a communication method for communicating the computer program a data structure of the computer program and the like.

In summary there is the following problem. In home network setting merely transmitting terminal information by proximity wireless communication is insufficient because statuses of surrounding terminals are unknown. Besides the user is required of a complex operation.

In view of this the following solution is provided. A terminal capable of obtaining position information by means of GPS or the like performs proximity wireless communication with a terminal which is subject to home network setting and the position information when proximity wireless communication is performed is used as position information of the terminal subject to home network setting. This allows the home network setting to be performed based on the position information in consideration of statuses of surrounding terminals.

Hence for example a communication device that can simplify various settings in a display device such as a TV which provides information about an item communication device is provided. In detail the image capturing device having the RF ID unit for performing proximity wireless communication with the RF ID reader writer includes the data receiving unit that receives an input signal the second memory that stores the UID unit which is identification information for specifying the communication device and the operation program executed by the TV with reference to the UID unit and the data transfer unit that transmits the UID unit and the operation program to the RF ID reader writer according to the input signal wherein the UID unit and the operation program are transferred to the TV via the RF ID reader writer see etc. .

The following describes other variations mentioned at the beginning of this section Description of Embodiments .

The position information may be an ID home ID of a home the home of installation among a plurality of IDs home IDs of a plurality of homes. This position information specifies the home the home in which the appliance the appliance is installed from among the plurality of homes e.g. the homes and in and indicates a position the position P in of the specified home from among positions the positions P and P of the plurality of homes as a position the position P of the mobile communication device when the proximity wireless communication is performed.

That is the predetermined position at which the appliance is installed may be inside a home wherein the mobile communication device stores an ID home ID of the home the ID being information specifying the home of a user of the mobile communication device and the transmission unit transmits to the server the server the transmission information the transmission information in that associates the position information with the ID of the home to cause the server to store in association with the ID a home ID in that is included in the transmitted transmission information as the ID of the home in which the appliance is installed information see a product serial number included in the transmission information other than the ID.

For example the transmission information may include the position information and the ID that are associated with each other.

Moreover the predetermined position at which the appliance is installed may be inside a home wherein the position information obtainment unit obtains the ID from a second server e.g. the server home server in as the position information the second server being provided in the home the home in which the appliance is installed and storing the ID of the home.

Moreover the position information obtainment unit may obtain the position information the position information in stored in a storage unit e.g. the memory in in the mobile communication device the position information specifying the mobile communication device the mobile communication device from among a plurality of devices to specify as a position a position P of the home in which the appliance the appliance is installed a position the position P of the home the home of a user of the specified mobile communication device.

Moreover the transmission unit may transmit the transmission information to the server to cause the first server the server in to store the transmitted transmission information and when the appliance the appliance has been moved from the predetermined position e.g. in the case of dumping illegal dumping in a mountain or the like cause the server to output the position information position information i.e. position information indicating the installation position of the appliance before dumped included in the transmission information transmission information in the case where the appliance information the appliance information in specifying the moved appliance is the same as the appliance information appliance information in that is included in the transmission information the transmission information stored in the server and specifies the installed appliance the appliance .

According to this structure the position information of the position before movement is outputted. This contributes to higher traceability.

Moreover the predetermined position at which the appliance is installed may be inside a home wherein the transmission unit transmits the transmission information to cause a predetermined image generation device e.g. the server see the position information generation unit N in to generate an image e.g. the map in the image in which shows an internal structure e.g. room arrangement of the home and in which a display item representing the appliance the TV NA specified by the obtained appliance information in the transmitted transmission information is superimposed included at the position the position of the TV NA at which the appliance is installed.

Data e.g. the above mentioned image for specifying a position of each appliance and information e.g. a type a product serial number of the appliance at the position may be generated in this way.

Moreover the obtained appliance information the appliance information in may be a product serial number of the appliance the product serial number specifying the installed appliance the appliance from among the plurality of appliances see etc. .

Moreover the appliance information obtainment unit may obtain at least one of type information type information in FIG. and function information function information from the installed appliance by the proximity wireless communication the type information indicating a type of the appliance and the function information indicating a function of the appliance wherein the transmitted transmission information includes the obtained at least one of type information and function information.

Regarding mere details in the above description processing according to the above embodiments Embodiments A and B such as Embodiment B e.g. Embodiment B4 is applicable. Processing according to improvement invention or any other appropriate processing is also applicable.

Details of processing in the above embodiments Embodiments A and B may be for instance as described in Other Variations .

The appliance see etc. such as a TV a BD recorder see the BD recorder NB etc. a heater see the heater NK etc. an air conditioner a solar panel a fire alarm and a solar panel is provided in the home see etc. .

In the case where the appliance is installed the predetermined transmission information including information such as a name of the user of the installed appliance is transmitted to and stored in the predetermined server see a database .

In recent years in a relatively large number of homes e.g. the home the user has the mobile communication device e.g. a mobile phone which is portable such as a mobile phone or a smartphone.

Moreover in recent years the mobile communication device e.g. a mobile phone is often used to perform the proximity wireless communication such as NFC mentioned above or RF ID communication in electronic money payment automatic ticket gates and so on.

For the proximity wireless communication the user performs as an example an operation of touching the mobile communication device to the other device in communication e.g. the appliance in see the touching movement Y and Y in etc. .

The proximity wireless communication is performed when as a result of the touching movement of the mobile communication device the position of the mobile communication device is the same position substantially same position e.g. within a distance of several centimeters as the position of the other device in communication the appliance . Meanwhile the proximity wireless communication is not performed when the movement is not made and so the two devices are not at the same position substantially same position .

For example when the appliance is installed in the home the mobile communication device is brought to touch the installed appliance see the movement to perform the proximity wireless communication between the installed appliance and the mobile communication device

In the case where the proximity wireless communication is performed S in Yes see the communication detection unit in the transmission information is transmitted to the server by a transmission device e.g. the mobile communication device .

In the case where the proximity wireless communication is not performed S in No on the other hand the transmission information is not transmitted.

In detail determination is made as to whether or not the proximity wireless communication between the installed appliance and the mobile communication device is performed e.g. whether or not the proximity wireless communication is currently enabled S in see the communication detection unit in .

In the case of determining that the proximity wireless communication is performed S Yes the transmission information is transmitted. In the case of determining that the proximity wireless communication is not performed S No the transmission information is not transmitted.

This allows the user to perform the transmission of the transmission information in the case where the appliance is installed by a simple operation such as an operation of touching the mobile communication device to the installed appliance

There is however a possibility that the information used by the manufacturer not shown of the installed appliance or the like after installation is not information available stored in the mobile communication device such as the phone number of the user of the mobile communication device who is also the user of the appliance but information e.g. the product serial number of the installed appliance not available in the mobile communication device

The information not available in the mobile communication device means for example information not stored in the mobile communication device before the proximity wireless communication is performed.

There is also a possibility that the use information not available in the mobile communication device is the pre installation known information specified by the manufacturer or the like upon manufacture of the appliance prior to installation such as the product serial number of the appliance

Accordingly the installed appliance may store the information pre installation known information such as the product serial number and transmit the stored information such as the product serial number by the proximity wireless communication with the mobile communication device when the appliance is installed.

In this case the mobile communication device obtains the information pre installation known information such as the product serial number transmitted by the proximity wireless communication .

The mobile communication device then transmits the transmission information including the obtained information pre installation known information such as the product serial number to the server

This eliminates the need for the user to input the information pre installation known information such as the product serial number to the mobile communication device thereby further simplifying the operation.

At least a part of the pre installation known information may be the appliance information see for specifying the appliance the first appliance from among a plurality of appliances e.g. the first appliance and the second appliance in such as the product serial number of the appliance as mentioned earlier.

At least a part of the pre installation known information may also be the type information for specifying the type of the appliance such as a TV a refrigerator or a microwave.

At least a part of the pre installation known information may also be the function information for specifying a function of the appliance

Examples of the specified function include a display function a terrestrial digital tuner function an analog tuner function and a recording function of a TV and the like.

Examples of the specified function also include a microwave function a heating function a cooling function a function of reading a recording medium recorded according to a predetermined standard e.g. DVD Digital Video Disc Blu ray a function of communicating according to a predetermined method e.g. Bluetooth ZigBee Ethernet and a function of electric power generation e.g. solar panel electric power generation .

The function information may also be component information for specifying a component e.g. a display unit such as a liquid crystal display a terrestrial digital tuner included in the appliance as the function of the appliance

At least a part of the pre installation known information may be attribute information e.g. the appliance information the type by the type information the function information for indicating an attribute e.g. the product serial number indicated by the appliance information the type indicated by the type information the function indicated by the function information the component indicated by the component information of the pre installation known information .

There is also demand for a more adequate customer service in accordance with where the appliance is installed such as a cold area a hot area a residential area a corner area a slope area or the like.

Hence there is a possibility that the use information used by the manufacturer or the like is the position information see indicating the position e.g. the position of the home of installation at which the appliance is installed.

Accordingly the transmission information including the position information for specifying the installation position may be transmitted to and stored in the server

This enables the manufacturer or the like to use the position information by using the transmission information the position information transmitted to the server

Based on the installation position indicated by the position information in the transmitted transmission information it is possible to display where the appliance was installed before dumping or display whether or not the appliance is installed in a slope area.

By such displaying the installation position after the appliance was dumped the traceability of the appliance can be enhanced.

As described above the proximity wireless communication is performed between the installed appliance and the mobile communication device . When the proximity wireless communication is performed the position of the mobile communication device is the same position substantially same position a position near the appliance as the position of the installed appliance

In recent years a mobile phone e.g. the mobile communication device is provided with a GPS device to obtain detect position information indicating the position of the mobile communication device

Meanwhile in order to obtain detect position information indicating the installation position in the installed appliance it is necessary to provide the appliance with a GPS device for obtaining position information which causes an increase in cost of the appliance

In view of this when the proximity wireless communication is performed and so the position of the installed appliance is the same position as the position of the mobile communication device the position information indicating the position of the mobile communication device may be obtained detected the position information obtainment unit S in .

In this case the transmission information further including as the position information indicating the installation position of the appliance the obtained position information of the position of the mobile communication device is transmitted.

Since this can be done merely by obtaining the position information in the mobile communication device a lower cost can be achieved.

Thus in the case of determining that the proximity wireless communication is performed S Yes the position information of the position the same position as the installation position of the appliance of the mobile communication device at this time is obtained and put to use.

The first position information A is the position information that specifies only the position of the home the first home in which the appliance is installed from among positions of a plurality of homes e.g. the first home the second home in and does not specify the installation position e.g. the position at which the TV NA is installed as illustrated in from among a plurality of positions e.g. the position of the TV NA the position of the heater NK in in the home in which the appliance is installed.

In other words the first position information A specifies the position with relatively low coarse accuracy with a relatively small amount of data.

That is at least a part of the position information obtainment unit may be the GPS device see the latitude longitude positioning unit Y in the GPS N in the position information calculation unit in etc. that obtains the first position information A of low accuracy.

For example the first position information A of low accuracy is home information see second position information in for specifying the home in which the appliance is installed from among the plurality of homes to thereby specify the position of the home.

In detail the home information may be the ID Identifier of the specified home among different IDs home IDs of the different homes.

Examples of the home ID include a number a character string and the like assigned to the home the first home in which the appliance is installed among the first home and the second home .

In association with this home ID the position information the first position information included in the transmission information a part e.g. the product serial number of the TV NA the product serial number of the heater NK other than the home ID in the transmission information for each appliance e.g. the TV NA the heater NK in installed in the home the first home specified by the home ID may be stored in the server

Such association is designated by the line between the home ID and each of the two product serial numbers in .

The position information may be second position information B for specifying the installation position e.g. the position at which the TV NA is installed as illustrated in from among the plurality of positions e.g. the position of the TV NA the position of the heater NK in in the home the first home in which the appliance is installed.

In other words the second position information B may be the position information that specifies the position with relatively high fine accuracy with a relatively large amount of data.

The processor may be provided to process the second position information B the position information position information in included in the transmitted transmission information .

For example the processor is a wireless communication device such as a wireless LAN access point which is installed in the home the first home in which the appliance is installed and performs wireless communication with the installed appliance

The processor obtains the second position information B the position information the position information in included in the transmitted transmission information an information obtainment unit Sin .

The processor determines whether the position the installation position of the appliance indicated by the obtained position information B the position information is the first position P e.g. the position of the heater NK in or the second position P e.g. the position of the TV NA a mode selection unit Sin .

In the case of determining that the position is the first position P S first position the processor performs first processing S suitable in the case of the first position P. In the case of determining that the position is the second position P S second position the processor performs second processing S suitable in the case of the second position P a wireless communication unit .

For example the first mode wireless communication first processing is suitable as wireless communication with the installed appliance in the case where the appliance is installed at the first position P the position of the heater NK i.e. the installed appliance is the first appliance at the first position P .

Meanwhile the second mode wireless communication second processing is suitable as wireless communication with the installed appliance in the case where the appliance is installed at the second position P the position of the TV NA i.e. the installed appliance is the second appliance at the second position P .

The wireless communication performed here is wireless communication with a wireless communication device the processor located for example at a position in such as a wireless LAN Local Area Network access point which is installed in the home the first home in which the appliance is installed.

For instance the first mode wireless communication is wireless communication with lower power than a threshold while the second mode wireless communication is wireless communication with higher power than the threshold.

Moreover for instance the first position P the position of the heater NK for which the low power wireless communication is suitable is a position within a distance of a threshold Th from the position of the access point or the like the processor while the second position P the position of the TV NA is a position not within the distance of the threshold Th from the position of the access point or the like.

From the other device in communication e.g. the first appliance the second appliance or the like the wireless communication device obtains appliance information e.g. the address of the appliance for specifying the appliance and also obtains position information the position information included in the transmitted transmission information transmission information the transmission information in that includes the same appliance information address e.g. the appliance information in as the obtained appliance information the information obtainment unit S .

Based on the obtained position information the wireless communication device performs the processing described above.

As a result suitable processing the first wireless communication the second wireless communication is performed depending on whether the installation position of the appliance is the first position P the position of the heater NK or the second position P the position of the TV NA . This ensures appropriate processing wireless communication in an appropriate mode with appropriate power regardless of whether the position is the first position P or the second position P.

This can be achieved simply by transmitting the transmission information using the mobile communication device such a mobile phone with there being no need for the user to install a special device or the like in the home the first home or perform a complex operation. Hence appropriate processing can be reliably performed with a simple operation.

Here the transmission information may be transmitted so that suitable processing the first wireless communication or the second wireless communication corresponding to the transmitted transmission information the position information is performed.

In detail the transmission information may be control data for controlling the processor to perform suitable processing the first wireless communication or the second wireless communication .

The first server to which the transmission information is transmitted may be a server installed in the home such as a home server e.g. the server in .

The first server may be connected to the communication line for communicating with outside the home in which the server is situated as illustrated in .

The first server may also be the above mentioned wireless communication device the processor such as an access point.

Alternatively the first server to which the transmission information is transmitted may be a server of the manufacturer of the appliance outside the home which performs communication via the communication line

As mentioned earlier the position information may be absolute position information for specifying an absolute position on a map such as a latitude and a longitude as in the case where the GPS device is used.

That is the position information obtainment unit see may include the GPS device where the position information obtainment unit receives a radio wave e.g. a radio wave from a GPS satellite and obtains from the received radio wave the position information which is absolute position information for indicating a position at which the radio wave is received as the position of the mobile communication device including the position information obtainment unit

Thus the position information obtainment unit may be a GPS device may include a GPS device or may be a device that receives a radio wave from a mobile phone base station and obtains from the received radio wave absolute position information the position information for specifying a position at which the radio wave is received.

For example there is an instance where it is impossible to obtain absolute position information i.e. it is impossible to obtain absolute position information of sufficiently high accuracy.

When a radio wave received by a device such as a GPS device that uses the received radio wave is not adequate to obtain position information of sufficiently high accuracy appropriate absolute position information cannot be obtained.

As an example there is the case where an inadequate radio wave is transmitted and so absolute position information cannot be obtained when a manufacturer manager or the like of the satellite or the base station transmitting the radio wave is different from the manufacturer or the like of the mobile communication device

Moreover a GPS device provided in a car navigation device car navigation is unable to obtain position information in a tunnel. Thus there is also the case where absolute position information cannot be obtained because the device is located at a position not suitable for obtaining position information from a radio wave.

In view of this a position of a base point may be used so that whether the installation position is the first position or the second position is specified based on a difference from the position of the base point to the installation position such as a distance a direction vector or the like from the base point position e.g. the base point in the position of the access point in to the installation position e.g. the position of the heater NK the position of the TV NA of the appliance

An example of such a base point position is the position of the access point e.g. the position of the processor in the position of the access point in described above.

In this case the obtained position information may be relative position information for specifying the difference e.g. a direction a distance a vector from the position of the base point the base point to the position of the mobile communication device when the proximity wireless communication is performed to thereby specify a position away from the position of the base point the base point by the specified difference as the installation position of the appliance

Such relative position information is information from which alone it is impossible to specify absolute position information such as the latitude and the longitude of the installation position of the appliance

That is the relative position information may be information that only indicates absolute position information of the installation position of the appliance as absolute position information of the position away from the position of the base point by the difference specified by the relative position information based on a plurality of pieces of information such as the relative position information and the position of the base point.

In recent years a communication device such as a smartphone is known to be provided with an acceleration sensor for detecting an acceleration of movement of the communication device.

For example the acceleration sensor is a sensor for displaying as a screen e.g. a screen including characters displayed by the mobile communication device an appropriate screen corresponding to a direction vertical or horizontal of the communication device after the movement of the detected acceleration from among a vertical direction character screen and a horizontal direction character screen.

The acceleration sensor in recent years is capable of detecting an acceleration of significantly high accuracy unlike its preceding acceleration sensor.

In view of this the position information obtainment unit may include the acceleration sensor see the position correction unit Y in the 6 axis sensor N in the acceleration sensor O in that is provided in the mobile communication device to detect an acceleration of movement of the mobile communication device and utilize the detected acceleration.

In detail when the user operates to move the mobile communication device from the base point e.g. the base point in the position of the access point in to the installation position of the appliance e.g. the heater NK the TV NA an acceleration of the movement is detected to thereby obtain calculate position information relative position information indicating the position e.g. the position of the heater NK the position of the TV NA of the mobile communication device

Note that the position prior to this movement is for example the position of the base point the base point mentioned above.

The transmission information including the position information which is the relative position information obtained based on the detected acceleration of the movement in this way is then transmitted to the server

For instance in the case where the position information which is the relative position information obtained based on the detected acceleration indicates the movement of the mobile communication device the difference e.g. distance direction from the position of the base point to the position after the movement e.g. the position of the heater NK from the base point the base point in the access point in to the first position P e.g. the position of the heater NK the installation position of the appliance is determined as the first position P the position of the heater NK Sin first position .

On the other hand in the case where the position information indicates the movement to the second position P the position of the TV NA the installation position of the appliance is determined as the second position P S second position . This ensures that suitable processing is performed even when the received radio wave of GPS or the like is inadequate and so absolute position information appropriate absolute position information e.g. absolute position information of appropriate accuracy cannot be obtained.

As illustrated in the obtained position information may include both relative position information indicating a difference movement of the mobile communication device D from a position P of the base point as obtained using the acceleration sensor and absolute position information of the position P of the base point

Here for example the first mode wireless communication S in is a mode of indirectly communicating with another device via a relay device such as a wireless LAN access point whereas the second mode wireless communication S in is a mode of direct communication without relay such as ad hoc communication or Wi Fi Wireless Fidelity direct communication.

This being so the first position P may be a position e.g. the position of the BD recorder NB at a distance relatively near a wireless communication device e.g. the TV NA which is the device in communication with the installed appliance i.e. a position where direct communication is preferable as higher communication quality than a threshold is attained.

Meanwhile the second position P may be a position e.g. the position of the heater NK the position of the TV NI at a distance relatively far from the wireless communication device e.g. the TV NA which is the device in communication i.e. a position where relay communication is preferable as direct communication results in low quality.

In detail the first position P where direct communication is preferable may be a position the position of the BD recorder NB in the same room the room with the TV NA as the position of the wireless communication device which is the device in communication.

As an example when the wireless communication device the TV NA which is the device in communication is a device the TV NA out of a TV and a blue ray recorder or the like installed in the same room as the TV the first position P the position of the BD recorder NB is the position the position of the BD recorder NB in the same room as the device the TV NA of the other installed appliance the BD recorder NB .

Meanwhile the second position P e.g. the position of the TV NI where relay communication is preferable may be a position in a room the room with the TV NI different from the wireless communication device the TV NA which is the device in communication or a position on a floor the second floor on which the TV NI is situated different from a floor the first floor on which the wireless communication device the TV NA is situated.

For example among a plurality of appliances e.g. a first appliance and a second appliance such as the TV NA and the heater NK in FIG. the user s operation on the remote controller I is performed only on an appliance the first appliance at a position e.g. a position P of the first appliance the TV NA in a direction I of the remote controller I and not on an appliance the second appliance at a position e.g. a position P of the second appliance the heater NK not in the direction I.

However there is the case where a signal outputted from the remote controller I to instruct the operation is a signal by an omnidirectional communication medium such as a radio signal.

In detail the remote controller I may be the above mentioned mobile communication device such as a mobile phone.

This can cause a situation where the signal also reaches the appliance the second appliance the heater NK not at the position the position P the position of the TV NA in the direction I as a result of which the operation of the remote controller I is wrongly performed on the appliance the second appliance the heater MK .

In view of this determination may be made as to whether the position specified by the position information included in the transmission information transmitted for the installed appliance e.g. the first appliance the second appliance is the first position the position jP the position of the TV NA which is a position in the direction I of the remote controller I Sin first position or the second position the position P the position of the heater NK which is not the position P in the direction I S second position a determination unit in .

In the case of determining that the position is the first position S first position the determined appliance the first appliance the TV NA is controlled to perform the operation e.g. channel switch power off first processing S .

In the case of determining that the position is the second position the position of the heater NK S second position the determined appliance is not controlled to perform the operation and second processing S which is other processing is performed an operation control unit in .

Note that one or both a control device of the determination unit and the operation control unit may be a functional block included in the above mentioned home server e.g. the server in provided in the home .

The first position information of low accuracy e.g. the home ID in may be an address or a phone number of the home of installation a product serial number of a mobile phone e.g. the mobile communication device of a resident of the home or a name of the resident.

The server may receive the transmission information and specify from among a plurality of homes e.g. the first home the second home in the home home ID at the position indicated by the transmission information as the home home ID e.g. the home ID of the first home in which the appliance is installed.

The same mobile communication device may transmit the first transmission information of the first appliance when touching the installed first appliance e.g. the TV NA in and also transmit the transmission information of the second appliance when touching the installed second appliance e.g. the heater NK .

Alternatively the second mobile communication device of a user in the home other than the user of the first mobile communication device other than the above mentioned first mobile communication device may transmit the second transmission information of the second appliance when touching the installed second appliance

The second transmission information transmitted here may include the same information e.g. the ID of the home as the first transmission information .

The second transmission information may include the above information included in the first transmission information which is obtained by the second mobile communication device from the server such as the home server e.g. the server in that stores the information.

The stored information may be information transmitted from the first mobile communication device to the server. As an alternative the information included in the first transmission information may be information which the first mobile communication device receives from the server.

The specific information for specifying the device e.g. the mobile communication device the installed appliance may be the product serial number of the device as mentioned above or a MAC Media Access Control address of the device.

The ID of the home in which the appliance is installed may be information that specifies by such a product serial number the home the home of the resident having the device e.g. the mobile communication device of the product serial number from among a plurality of homes.

The product serial number or the like used as the ID of the home may be a product serial number of an appliance corresponding to first transmission of transmission information among a plurality of appliances see the appliances in installed in the home.
