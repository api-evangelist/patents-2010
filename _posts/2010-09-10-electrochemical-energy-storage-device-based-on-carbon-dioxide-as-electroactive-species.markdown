title: Electrochemical energy storage device based on carbon dioxide as electroactive species
abstract: An electrochemical energy storage device comprising a primary positive electrode, a negative electrode, and one or more ionic conductors. The ionic conductors ionically connect the primary positive electrode with the negative electrode. The primary positive electrode comprises carbon dioxide (CO) and a means for electrochemically reducing the CO. This means for electrochemically reducing the COcomprises a conductive primary current collector, contacting the CO, whereby the COis reduced upon the primary current collector during discharge. The primary current collector comprises a material to which COand the ionic conductors are essentially non-corrosive. The electrochemical energy storage device uses COas an electroactive species in that the COis electrochemically reduced during discharge to enable the release of electrical energy from the device.
