This present application claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 290 375 entitled SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR A VPN ICA PROXY ON A MULTI CORE SYSTEM filed Dec. 28 2009 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The present application generally relates to the management of application connections associated with a virtual private network VPN session. In particular the present application relates to systems and methods for a VPN application provisioning proxy in a multi core system.

Remote computing and centralized management of computing environments have recently converge to not only provide remote access to application resources but also to incorporate management aspects including multi level security e.g. authentication and firewall policies support for a variety of access points and client environments and uniform presentation of resources. Systems that host and or provision applications to remote users may deliver computing and or application services in s variety of ways. For example dedicated servers may provide access to particular software applications by delivering application components to a remote client for execution. Other servers may deliver graphical user components for presentation at a remote client although some or all of the underlying computing occurs at the server side. In another example a system may stream application services in real time to a local client via high level commands. These high level commands may be used to assemble a user interface for the back end applications services delivered from servers. As application and computing needs evolve provisioning systems may have to provide a higher level of service in both delivery and performance. Accordingly some provisioning system may provide some level of parallel processing or multi tasking.

The present application is directed towards methods and systems of a VPN application provisioning proxy on a multi core system. As part of an application delivery system an intermediary device may reside between at least one client device and at least one server providing application services. In order to process multiple requests for services and connections the intermediary may employ a multiple processor or multi core system for handling the requests or various aspects of a request in parallel. Management systems for service access may leverage on a pool of licenses for tracking e.g. usage levels of services accounting e.g. chargeback for usage distribution and or resource management purposes. Since licenses may be shared for related services and or user sessions a system for managing license usage and sharing is described in this disclosure.

In one aspect the present invention is related to a method for sharing licenses across resources via a multi core intermediary device. The method includes granting by a device intermediary to a plurality of clients and a server a license for a VPN session established by a first core of a plurality of cores of the device with a client. A second core of the plurality of cores may receive a first request from the client to establish an application connection between an application and a server via the VPN session. The second core may send a second request to the first core to share the license of the VPN session responsive to determining that the first core owns the VPN session. The second core may establish the application connection responsive to receiving from the first core a response accepting the second request to share the license of the VPN session.

In some embodiments the first core may establish the VPN session for a user of a plurality of users for access to a domain. The device may maintaining a single VPN session for each user in connection with a domain. A license manager may grant the license from a pool of licenses managed via the device. The second core may receive the first request from the user to access a resource of the domain. The second core may determine from a provisioning list that the first core owns the VPN session. The first core may determine that the first request is for access to the same domain as the VPN session. The first core may update a provisioning list to identify sharing the license between the VPN session and the application connection. In certain embodiments the second core disestablishes the application connection and sends a message to the first core to update the first core s provisioning list. A third core of the plurality of core may receive a third request to establish a second application connection. The third core may establish the second application connection responsive to receiving from the first core a second response accepting a fourth request to share the license of the VPN session.

In another aspect the present invention is related to a system for sharing licenses across resources via a multi core intermediary device. The system may include a device intermediary to a plurality of clients and a server. A license manager may grant a license for a virtual private network VPN session established by a first core of a plurality of cores of the device with a client. A second core of the plurality of cores of the device may receive from the client a first request to establish an application connection between an application and a server via the VPN session. The second core may send to the first core a second request to share the license of the VPN session responsive to determining that the first core owns the VPN session. The second core may establish the application connection responsive to receiving from the first core a response accepting the second request to share the license of the VPN session.

In some embodiments the license manager manages a pool of licenses for resources accessed via the device. The device may maintain a single VPN session for each user in connection with a domain. The device may establish the VPN session for a user of a plurality of users for access to a domain. The device may receive the first request from the user to access a resource of the domain. The second core may determine from a provisioning list that the first core owns the VPN session. The first core may determine that the first request is for access to the same domain as the VPN session. The first core may update a provisioning list to identify sharing the license between the VPN session and the application connection. In certain embodiments the second core disestablishes the application connection and sends a message to the first core to update the first core s provisioning list. A third core of the plurality of cores may receive a third request to establish a second application connection. The third core may establish the second application connection responsive to receiving from the first core a second response accepting a fourth request to share the license of the VPN session.

In yet another aspect the present invention is related to a method of a VPN application provisioning proxy on a multi core system. The method includes receiving by a first core of a plurality of cores a request from a user to establish an application connection with a server. The first core may determine that a provisioning list of the first core does not exist. The provisioning list may identify one or more VPN sessions and application connections associated with the first core and one or more licenses consumed by the one or more VPN sessions and application connections. Responsive to the determination the first core may request a second core for a license to share in establishing the requested application connection. The second core may have a provisioning list that identifies at least one VPN session or application connection sharing the license. Responsive to receiving a response accepting the request to share the license the first core may establish the requested application connection.

The software designed and constructed for a single CPU may be redesigned and or rewritten to take advantage of a multi threaded parallel architecture or otherwise a multi core architecture.

A multi core architecture of the appliance referred to as nCore or multi core technology allows the appliance in some embodiments to break the single core performance barrier and to leverage the power of multi core CPUs. In the previous architecture described in connection with a single network or packet engine is run. The multiple cores of the nCore technology and architecture allow multiple packet engines to run concurrently and or in parallel. With a packet engine running on each core the appliance architecture leverages the processing capacity of additional cores. In some embodiments this provides up to a 7 increase in performance and scalability.

Illustrated in are some embodiments of work task load or network traffic distribution across one or more processor cores according to a type of parallelism or parallel computing scheme such as functional parallelism data parallelism or flow based data parallelism. In brief overview illustrates embodiments of a multi core system such as an appliance with n cores a total of cores numbers through N. In one embodiment work load or network traffic can be distributed among a first core A a second core B a third core C a fourth core D a fifth core E a sixth core F a seventh core G and so on such that distribution is across all or two or more of the n cores N hereinafter referred to collectively as cores . There may be multiple VIPs each running on a respective core of the plurality of cores. There may be multiple packet engines each running on a respective core of the plurality of cores. Any of the approaches used may lead to different varying or similar work load or performance level across any of the cores. For a functional parallelism approach each core may run a different function of the functionalities provided by the packet engine a VIP or appliance . In a data parallelism approach data may be paralleled or distributed across the cores based on the Network Interface Card NIC or VIP receiving the data. In another data parallelism approach processing may be distributed across the cores by distributing data flows to each core.

In further detail to in some embodiments load work or network traffic can be distributed among cores according to functional parallelism . Functional parallelism may be based on each core performing one or more respective functions. In some embodiments a first core may perform a first function while a second core performs a second function. In functional parallelism approach the functions to be performed by the multi core system are divided and distributed to each core according to functionality. In some embodiments functional parallelism may be referred to as task parallelism and may be achieved when each processor or core executes a different process or function on the same or different data. The core or processor may execute the same or different code. In some cases different execution threads or code may communicate with one another as they work. Communication may take place to pass data from one thread to the next as part of a workflow.

In some embodiments distributing work across the cores according to functional parallelism can comprise distributing network traffic according to a particular function such as network input output management NW I O A secure sockets layer SSL encryption and decryption B and transmission control protocol TCP functions C. This may lead to a work performance or computing load based on a volume or level of functionality being used. In some embodiments distributing work across the cores according to data parallelism can comprise distributing an amount of work based on distributing data associated with a particular hardware or software component. In some embodiments distributing work across the cores according to flow based data parallelism can comprise distributing data based on a context or flow such that the amount of work A N on each core may be similar substantially equal or relatively evenly distributed.

In the case of the functional parallelism approach each core may be configured to run one or more functionalities of the plurality of functionalities provided by the packet engine or VIP of the appliance. For example core may perform network I O processing for the appliance while core performs TCP connection management for the appliance. Likewise core may perform SSL offloading while core may perform layer 7 or application layer processing and traffic management. Each of the cores may perform the same function or different functions. Each of the cores may perform more than one function. Any of the cores may run any of the functionality or portions thereof identified and or described in conjunction with . In this the approach the work across the cores may be divided by function in either a coarse grained or fine grained manner. In some cases as illustrated in division by function may lead to different cores running at different levels of performance or load .

In this the approach the work across the cores may be divided by function in either a coarse grained or fine grained manner. In some cases as illustrated in division by function may lead to different cores running at different levels of load or performance.

The functionality or tasks may be distributed in any arrangement and scheme. For example illustrates a first core Core A processing applications and processes associated with network I O functionality A. Network traffic associated with network I O in some embodiments can be associated with a particular port number. Thus outgoing and incoming packets having a port destination associated with NW I O A will be directed towards Core A which is dedicated to handling all network traffic associated with the NW I O port. Similarly Core B is dedicated to handling functionality associated with SSL processing and Core D may be dedicated handling all TCP level processing and functionality.

While illustrates functions such as network I O SSL and TCP other functions can be assigned to cores. These other functions can include any one or more of the functions or operations described herein. For example any of the functions described in conjunction with may be distributed across the cores on a functionality basis. In some cases a first VIP A may run on a first core while a second VIP B with a different configuration may run on a second core. In some embodiments each core can handle a particular functionality such that each core can handle the processing associated with that particular function. For example Core B may handle SSL offloading while Core D may handle application layer processing and traffic management.

In other embodiments work load or network traffic may be distributed among cores according to any type and form of data parallelism . In some embodiments data parallelism may be achieved in a multi core system by each core performing the same task or functionally on different pieces of distributed data. In some embodiments a single execution thread or code controls operations on all pieces of data. In other embodiments different threads or instructions control the operation but may execute the same code. In some embodiments data parallelism is achieved from the perspective of a packet engine vServers VIPs A C network interface cards NIC D E and or any other networking hardware or software included on or associated with an appliance . For example each core may run the same packet engine or VIP code or configuration but operate on different sets of distributed data. Each networking hardware or software construct can receive different varying or substantially the same amount of data and as a result may have varying different or relatively the same amount of load .

In the case of a data parallelism approach the work may be divided up and distributed based on VIPs NICs and or data flows of the VIPs or NICs. In one of these approaches the work of the multi core system may be divided or distributed among the VIPs by having each VIP work on a distributed set of data. For example each core may be configured to run one or more VIPs. Network traffic may be distributed to the core for each VIP handling that traffic. In another of these approaches the work of the appliance may be divided or distributed among the cores based on which NIC receives the network traffic. For example network traffic of a first NIC may be distributed to a first core while network traffic of a second NIC may be distributed to a second core. In some cases a core may process data from multiple NICs.

While illustrates a single vServer associated with a single core as is the case for VIP A VIP B and VIP C. In some embodiments a single vServer can be associated with one or more cores . In contrast one or more vServers can be associated with a single core . Associating a vServer with a core may include that core to process all functions associated with that particular vServer. In some embodiments each core executes a VIP having the same code and configuration. In other embodiments each core executes a VIP having the same code but different configuration. In some embodiments each core executes a VIP having different code and the same or different configuration.

Like vServers NICs can also be associated with particular cores . In many embodiments NICs can be connected to one or more cores such that when a NIC receives or transmits data packets a particular core handles the processing involved with receiving and transmitting the data packets. In one embodiment a single NIC can be associated with a single core as is the case with NIC D and NIC E. In other embodiments one or more NICs can be associated with a single core . In other embodiments a single NIC can be associated with one or more cores . In these embodiments load could be distributed amongst the one or more cores such that each core processes a substantially similar amount of load. A core associated with a NIC may process all functions and or data associated with that particular NIC.

While distributing work across cores based on data of VIPs or NICs may have a level of independency in some embodiments this may lead to unbalanced use of cores as illustrated by the varying loads of .

In some embodiments load work or network traffic can be distributed among cores based on any type and form of data flow. In another of these approaches the work may be divided or distributed among cores based on data flows. For example network traffic between a client and a server traversing the appliance may be distributed to and processed by one core of the plurality of cores. In some cases the core initially establishing the session or connection may be the core for which network traffic for that session or connection is distributed. In some embodiments the data flow is based on any unit or portion of network traffic such as a transaction a request response communication or traffic originating from an application on a client. In this manner and in some embodiments data flows between clients and servers traversing the appliance may be distributed in a more balanced manner than the other approaches.

In flow based data parallelism distribution of data is related to any type of flow of data such as request response pairings transactions sessions connections or application communications. For example network traffic between a client and a server traversing the appliance may be distributed to and processed by one core of the plurality of cores. In some cases the core initially establishing the session or connection may be the core for which network traffic for that session or connection is distributed. The distribution of data flow may be such that each core carries a substantially equal or relatively evenly distributed amount of load data or network traffic.

In some embodiments the data flow is based on any unit or portion of network traffic such as a transaction a request response communication or traffic originating from an application on a client. In this manner and in some embodiments data flows between clients and servers traversing the appliance may be distributed in a more balanced manner than the other approached. In one embodiment data flow can be distributed based on a transaction or a series of transactions. This transaction in some embodiments can be between a client and a server and can be characterized by an IP address or other packet identifier. For example Core A can be dedicated to transactions between a particular client and a particular server therefore the load A on Core A may be comprised of the network traffic associated with the transactions between the particular client and server. Allocating the network traffic to Core A can be accomplished by routing all data packets originating from either the particular client or server to Core A.

While work or load can be distributed to the cores based in part on transactions in other embodiments load or work can be allocated on a per packet basis. In these embodiments the appliance can intercept data packets and allocate them to a core having the least amount of load. For example the appliance could allocate a first incoming data packet to Core A because the load A on Core is less than the load B N on the rest of the cores B N. Once the first data packet is allocated to Core A the amount of load A on Core A is increased proportional to the amount of processing resources needed to process the first data packet. When the appliance intercepts a second data packet the appliance will allocate the load to Core D because Core D has the second least amount of load. Allocating data packets to the core with the least amount of load can in some embodiments ensure that the load A N distributed to each core remains substantially equal.

In other embodiments load can be allocated on a per unit basis where a section of network traffic is allocated to a particular core . The above mentioned example illustrates load balancing on a per packet basis. In other embodiments load can be allocated based on a number of packets such that every 10 100 or 1000 packets are allocated to the core having the least amount of load. The number of packets allocated to a core can be a number determined by an application user or administrator and can be any number greater than zero. In still other embodiments load can be allocated based on a time metric such that packets are distributed to a particular core for a predetermined amount of time. In these embodiments packets can be distributed to a particular core for five milliseconds or for any period of time determined by a user program system administrator or otherwise. After the predetermined time period elapses data packets are transmitted to a different core for the predetermined period of time.

Flow based data parallelism methods for distributing work load or network traffic among the one or more cores can comprise any combination of the above mentioned embodiments. These methods can be carried out by any part of the appliance by an application or set of executable instructions executing on one of the cores such as the packet engine or by any application program or agent executing on a computing device in communication with the appliance .

The functional and data parallelism computing schemes illustrated in can be combined in any manner to generate a hybrid parallelism or distributed processing scheme that encompasses function parallelism data parallelism flow based data parallelism or any portions thereof. In some cases the multi core system may use any type and form of load balancing schemes to distribute load among the one or more cores . The load balancing scheme may be used in any combination with any of the functional and data parallelism schemes or combinations thereof.

The packet engine s A N can in some embodiments be associated with a particular server user client or network. When a packet engine becomes associated with a particular entity that packet engine can process data packets associated with that entity. For example should a packet engine be associated with a first user that packet engine will process and operate on packets generated by the first user or packets having a destination address associated with the first user. Similarly the packet engine may choose not to be associated with a particular entity such that the packet engine can process and otherwise operate on any data packets not generated by that entity or destined for that entity.

A core may have or use memory that is shared or assigned to multiple cores. The memory may be considered public or shared memory that is accessible by more than one core. A core may use any combination of private and public memory. With separate address spaces for each core some level of coordination is eliminated from the case of using the same address space. With a separate address space a core can perform work on information and data in the core s own address space without worrying about conflicts with other cores. Each packet engine may have a separate memory pool for TCP and or SSL connections.

For example one device may comprise two or more cores and another device may comprise two or more cores. For example a multi core system may include a cluster of computing devices a server farm or network of computing devices. In some embodiments instead of the functionality of the cores being deployed in the form of cores the functionality may be deployed on a plurality of processors such as a plurality of single core processors.

In one embodiment the cores may be any type and form of processor. In some embodiments a core can function substantially similar to any processor or central processing unit described herein.

In embodiments where the system comprises one or more flow distributors each flow distributor can be associated with a processor or a packet engine . The flow distributors can comprise an interface mechanism that allows each flow distributor to communicate with the other flow distributors executing within the system . In one instance the one or more flow distributors can determine how to balance load by communicating with each other. This process can operate substantially similarly to the process described above for submitting votes to an arbiter which then determines which flow distributor should receive the load. In other embodiments a first flow distributor can identify the load on an associated core and determine whether to forward a first data packet to the associated core based on any of the following criteria the load on the associated core is above a predetermined threshold the load on the associated core is below a predetermined threshold the load on the associated core is less than the load on the other cores or any other metric that can be used to determine where to forward data packets based in part on the amount of load on a processor.

In one embodiment RSS is a Microsoft Scalable Networking initiative technology that enables receive processing to be balanced across multiple processors in the system while maintaining in order delivery of the data. The RSS may use any type and form of hashing scheme to determine a core or processor for processing a network packet.

The hash function may be designed and constructed based on any one or more criteria or design goals. In some embodiments a hash function may be used that provides an even distribution of hash result for different hash inputs and different hash types including TCP IPv4 TCP IPv6 IPv4 and IPv6 headers. In some embodiments a hash function may be used that provides a hash result that is evenly distributed when a small number of buckets are present for example two or four . In some embodiments hash function may be used that provides a hash result that is randomly distributed when a large number of buckets were present for example 64 buckets . In some embodiments the hash function is determined based on a level of computational or resource usage. In some embodiments the hash function is determined based on ease or difficulty of implementing the hash in hardware. In some embodiments the hash function is determined based on the ease or difficulty of a malicious remote host to send packets that would all hash to the same bucket.

The RSS may generate hashes from any type and form of input such as a sequence of values. This sequence of values can include any portion of the network packet such as any header field or payload of network packet or portions thereof. In some embodiments the input to the hash may be referred to as a hash type and include any tuples of information associated with a network packet or data flow such as any of the following a four tuple comprising at least two IP addresses and two ports a four tuple comprising any four sets of values a six tuple a two tuple and or any other sequence of numbers or values.

In some embodiments one or more hash bits or mask are applied to the hash result. The hash bit or mask may be any number of bits or bytes. A NIC may support any number of bits such as seven bits. The network stack may set the actual number of bits to be used during initialization. The number will be between 1 and 7 inclusive.

The hash result may be used to identify the core or entity via any type and form of table such as a bucket table or indirection table. In some embodiments the number of hash result bits are used to index into the table. The range of the hash mask may effectively define the size of the indirection table. Any portion of the hash result or the hash result itself may be used to index the indirection table. The values in the table may identify any of the cores or processor such as by a core or processor identifier. In some embodiments all of the cores of the multi core system are identified in the table. In other embodiments a port of the cores of the multi core system are identified in the table. The indirection table may comprise any number of buckets for example 2 to 128 buckets that may be indexed by a hash mask. Each bucket may comprise a range of index values that identify a core or processor.

In some embodiments the flow distributor can execute on the first core A while in other embodiments the flow distributor can execute on the NIC . In still other embodiments an instance of the flow distributor can execute on each core included in the multi core system . In this embodiment each instance of the flow distributor can communicate with other instances of the flow distributor to forward packets back and forth across the cores . There exist situations where a response to a request packet may not be processed by the same core i.e. the first core processes the request while the second core processes the response. In these situations the instances of the flow distributor can intercept the packet and forward it to the desired or correct core i.e. a flow distributor instance can forward the response to the first core. Multiple instances of the flow distributor can execute on any number of cores and any combination of cores .

The flow distributor may operate responsive to any one or more rules or policies. The rules may identify a core or packet processing engine to receive a network packet data or data flow. The rules may identify any type and form of tuple information related to a network packet such as a 4 tuple of source and destination IP address and source and destination ports. Based on a received packet matching the tuple specified by the rule the flow distributor may forward the packet to a core or packet engine. In some embodiments the packet is forwarded to a core via shared memory and or core to core messaging.

Although illustrates the flow distributor as executing within the multi core system in some embodiments the flow distributor can execute on a computing device or appliance remotely located from the multi core system .

Any portion of the memory of each of the cores may be allocated to or used for a global cache that is shared by the cores. In brief overview a predetermined percentage or predetermined amount of each of the memory of each core may be used for the global cache.

That is in the illustrated embodiment 2 GB of each core excluding the control plane core or core may be used to form a 28 GB shared global cache. The configuration of the control plane such as via the configuration services may determine the amount of memory used for the shared global cache. In some embodiments each core may provide a different amount of memory for use by the global cache. In other embodiments any one core may not provide any memory or use the global cache. In some embodiments any of the cores may also have a local cache in memory not allocated to the global shared memory. Each of the cores may store any portion of network traffic to the global shared cache. Each of the cores may check the cache for any content to use in a request or response. Any of the cores may obtain content from the global shared cache to use in a data flow request or response.

The global cache can be any type and form of memory or storage element such as any memory or storage element described herein. In some embodiments the cores may have access to a predetermined amount of memory i.e. 32 GB or any other memory amount commensurate with the system . The global cache can be allocated from that predetermined amount of memory while the rest of the available memory can be allocated among the cores . In other embodiments each core can have a predetermined amount of memory. The global cache can comprise an amount of the memory allocated to each core . This memory amount can be measured in bytes or can be measured as a percentage of the memory allocated to each core . Thus the global cache can comprise 1 GB of memory from the memory associated with each core or can comprise 20 percent or one half of the memory associated with each core . In some embodiments only a portion of the cores provide memory to the global cache while in other embodiments the global cache can comprise memory not allocated to the cores .

Each core can use the global cache to store network traffic or cache data. In some embodiments the packet engines of the core use the global cache to cache and use data stored by the plurality of packet engines. For example the cache manager of and cache functionality of may use the global cache to share data for acceleration. For example each of the packet engines may store responses such as HTML data to the global cache. Any of the cache managers operating on a core may access the global cache to server caches responses to client requests.

In some embodiments the cores can use the global cache to store a port allocation table which can be used to determine data flow based in part on ports. In other embodiments the cores can use the global cache to store an address lookup table or any other table or list that can be used by the flow distributor to determine where to direct incoming and outgoing data packets. The cores can in some embodiments read from and write to cache while in other embodiments the cores can only read from or write to cache . The cores may use the global cache to perform core to core communications.

The global cache may be sectioned into individual memory sections where each section can be dedicated to a particular core . In one embodiment the control core A can receive a greater amount of available cache while the other cores can receiving varying amounts or access to the global cache .

In some embodiments the system can comprise a control core A. While illustrates core A as the control core the control core can be any core within the appliance or multi core system. Further while only a single control core is depicted the system can comprise one or more control cores each having a level of control over the system. In some embodiments one or more control cores can each control a particular aspect of the system . For example one core can control deciding which distribution scheme to use while another core can determine the size of the global cache .

The control plane of the multi core system may be the designation and configuration of a core as the dedicated management core or as a master core. This control plane core may provide control management and coordination of operation and functionality the plurality of cores in the multi core system. This control plane core may provide control management and coordination of allocation and use of memory of the system among the plurality of cores in the multi core system including initialization and configuration of the same. In some embodiments the control plane includes the flow distributor for controlling the assignment of data flows to cores and the distribution of network packets to cores based on data flows. In some embodiments the control plane core runs a packet engine and in other embodiments the control plane core is dedicated to management and control of the other cores of the system.

The control core A can exercise a level of control over the other cores such as determining how much memory should be allocated to each core or determining which core should be assigned to handle a particular function or hardware software entity. The control core A in some embodiments can exercise control over those cores within the control plan . Thus there can exist processors outside of the control plane which are not controlled by the control core A. Determining the boundaries of the control plane can include maintaining by the control core A or agent executing within the system a list of those cores controlled by the control core A. The control core A can control any of the following initialization of a core determining when a core is unavailable re distributing load to other cores when one core fails determining which distribution scheme to implement determining which core should receive network traffic determining how much cache should be allocated to each core determining whether to assign a particular function or element to a particular core determining whether to permit cores to communicate with one another determining the size of the global cache and any other determination of a function configuration or operation of the cores within the system .

A SSL session may be allocated private memory address space and associated with a SSL protocol stack that is independent from other SSL sessions. In a single core system such as a single core appliance maintaining a SSL session between a client and a server the SSL session may be resumed if the SSL session is temporarily disrupted and or inactive. For example a disruption may occur due to a mobile client disconnecting and reconnecting to a network or a server going offline due to inactivity or power loss. A client may send a request to resume the SSL session instead of establishing a new session. This may be more efficient in terms of the time and resources consumed in performing a full handshake process allocating memory starting a protocol stack and meeting authentication authorization requirements. Furthermore the disrupted SSL session may remain persistent although a connection may be lost. Resuming a SSL session may also maintain some level of continuity in client server communications.

In some embodiments a packet engine maintains a connection between a client and a core directing packets from the client to the core . The packet engine can maintain a TCP connection through a core for example by identifying the core based on information from received packets and or client . A flow distributor may direct traffic to a packet engine of a core by associating a connection based on information from received packets and or client . In one embodiment this information includes a TCP tuple or TCP quadruple. A TCP tuple may include information on a source IP address a source port number a destination IP address and a destination port number. The TCP tuple may be extracted from a packet. The TCP tuple may remain the same for a client connection and or session. In some embodiments a disruption to a connection of session may cause the TCP tuple to change. For example the source port number may change if the client attempts to reconnect to the intermediary .

The flow distributor may generate a hash index or other identifier based on a TCP tuple to associate the packet traffic with a core. In some embodiments when a TCP tuple changes a different hash index or identifier is generated and a second core is identified instead. Upon a disruption to a connection or session a client may attempt to resume transmission of packets. These packets may come from a different application instance of the client . These packets may provide a different source port information. Other components of the TCP tuple may also change. Based on a changed TCP tuple the flow distributor may generate a second hash index or identifier and direct packet traffic from the client to a second core corresponding to the second hash index or identifier.

In some embodiments use of a flow distributor and or packet engines in a multi core system can result in higher SSL transactions per second TPS and or bulk throughput numbers. Each core may have a virtual IP address VIP associated with the core that may or may not be established in relation to a SSL session . In some embodiments the flow distributor identifies each core via the VIP of the core.

Referring now to an embodiment of a system for managing SSL session persistence and reuse is depicted. In brief overview the system includes an intermediary between a client and a server . The intermediary comprises a multi core system a flow distributor and a storage or memory module . In some embodiments a SSL session may be established and maintained by one of a plurality of cores in a multi core system such as the first core . This core is sometimes referred to as the owner of the SSL session . Upon disruption of the SSL session a client may request resumption of the SSL session by sending a request to the multi core system. The flow distributor may direct the request to a second core that will determine if it owns the disrupted SSL session . The second core may identify the owner of the session and determine if the session can be resumed. The second core can communicate with the first core and receive information for cloning the disrupted SSL session for reuse by the second core . Upon completion of the cloning the connection between the client and the server is resumed based on the cloned session .

Each core of the multi core system can include a transceiver . The transceiver can receive packets or messages directed from the flow distributor . The transceiver can also communicate with other cores of the multi core system. In some embodiments inter core communication involves sending a core to core messaging CCM message from a first core to a second core . The transceiver may support packets and messages based on any type or form of communication protocols. The transceiver can also communicate with other components of the intermediary . For example a core can access data from memory using the transceiver as an interface. The transceiver can also transmit a packet or message to another machine such as server . The transceiver may direct outgoing packets or messages to a destination based on information from the associated TCP tuple.

Each core may include a decoder encoder pair hereinafter generally referred to as a cipher . A cipher may comprise hardware or any combination of software and hardware. The cipher may include an application program library script process task thread or any type and form of executable instructions. Although the cipher is illustrated as part of a certificate manager in some embodiments the cipher may be a separate component or module of the multi core system. In one embodiment the cipher may include a general purpose encoder decoder. In another embodiment the cipher is designed and constructed to encode encrypt or decode decrypt any type and form of information such as session identifiers and or core identifiers . In one embodiment the ciphers are block ciphers. Further the ciphers may include functionality from any embodiment of the encryption engine described in connection with . In some embodiments the system uses data encryption standard DES ciphers such as standard DES ciphers and 3DES ciphers.

The first core is assigned a core identifier . The core identifier may be any type or form of alphanumeric identifier or code string. In addition this core identifier may be unique among the plurality of cores of the multi core system. The core identifier may be a CPU number of the core or incorporate the CPU number of the core . A core identifier may be assigned sequentially to each core based on the CPU numbers of the cores. The core identifier can be of any size. In one embodiment the core identifier is one byte in size. In particular one byte can give 256 0 255 unique core identifiers.

The first core can establish a SSL session between the client and the server . The SSL session may be established in connection with the cipher and or functionality from any embodiment of the encryption engine described in connection with . The SSL session is assigned a session identifier which can be any type or form of alphanumeric identifier or code string. The first core the backend server or the client may issue the session identifier . The session identifier may uniquely identify the SSL session among a plurality of SSL sessions associated with the multi core system. A session identifier may be a random 16 or 32 byte value. In one embodiment the X OR of the byte with byte location of the session identifier results in a random value. By randomly selecting a one byte location in the session identifier for encoding the core identifier such as at system boot time additional security and randomness with respect to the session identifier may be incorporated. In one embodiment a SSLv2 session identifier has a size of 16 bytes and the last 4 bytes may contain a time stamp. In this embodiment the one byte location for the core identifier is preferably between byte to byte . In another embodiment a session identifier is 32 bytes for SSLv3 and TLSv1. The lower 4 bytes may be taken up by the timestamp allowing 28 bytes for encoding a core identifier in SSLv3 TLSv1 protocol. Other than the byte locations reserved for timestamp purposes the byte location for encoding a core identifier may be selected by any means.

By way of illustration and not limiting in any way one embodiment of pseudo code for encoding a core identifier may be 

In some embodiments a valid session identifier is encoded with a core identifier. A valid session identifier is sometimes referred to as a validity identifier. A valid session identifier can be a string that identifies a valid session. As an example a cipher may use 8 bytes to encode the valid session identifier and the core identifier. The intermediary or the multi core system can determine whether a session is valid. In one embodiment use of a valid session identifier helps to filter away random or malicious requests to reuse a session. A valid session identifier may also identify active reused sessions.

In some other embodiments the core identifier is not encoded within a byte or a range of bits of a session identifier. Instead individual bits of a session identifier can be used to encode a core identifier . The core identifier can be encoded as a bit pattern in the session identifier . Other than the byte locations that are reserved for timestamp purposes the individual bit locations for encoding a core identifier may be selected by any means. When a session identifier is generated by the core owning the SSL session individual bits can be set to encode the core identifier . The number of bits that are set or unset may depend on the number of cores in the multi core system. This method may impose a relatively small footprint on session identifiers as the number of bits affected is limited to the number of cores in the multi core system

The first core or the packet engine of the first core may store the session identifier in a session cache of the first core . In one embodiment the session cache is persistent for the duration that the core is powered up and or the duration that a session is maintained. In another embodiment the session cache is persistent even when the core is powered down or when a session has ended. The session cache can be memory allocated to the first core and or the SSL session . The session cache may be accessed by one or more cores. In some embodiments the first core maintains and or updates the session cache . The memory module may include the session cache . The memory module may comprise one or more interconnected storage devices such as any embodiment of storage devices described above in connection with F and A.

In some embodiments the session cache stores the session identifier of the SSL session established by the first core . The session cache may store a plurality of session identifiers such as session identifiers of sessions established by the first core . The first core may encode the core identifier in the session identifier to form a second session identifier . In some embodiments the cipher encodes the core identifier in the session identifier to form the second session identifier . In one embodiment the cipher encodes the core identifier in one byte of the session identifier . Encoder decoder routines of the cipher can securely encode the core identifier in the second session identifier and or decode the core identifier . Encoder decoder routines of the cipher can also securely encode decode a valid session identifier in association with the session identifier . In another embodiment the core identifier can be directly stored into bits of the second session identifier . The second session identifier can be stored in the session cache either with the session identifier or in replacement of the session identifier .

In some embodiments the second core is substantially similar or identical to the first core in terms of functionality capability and or associated elements. For example the second core includes a transceiver and a decoder and is associated with a session cache . The second core can be assigned a unique core identifier . The second may similarly establish a new SSL session. In addition the second core may reuse a SSL session of the first core .

The intermediary includes a set of policies . These policies may be any embodiments of the policies described in connection with A B and . These policies may be applied to a request such as a request to resume a SSL session. The policies can also determine to which core the flow distributor directs an incoming message. In addition an associated policy engine may apply the policies for example to determine whether a session can be resumed or reused. In some embodiments the policies are stored in the memory module . For example the policies can be stored in a private partition of the memory module . Some of these policies may be grouped and associated with a client and or a server .

A core may resume a session that it has established. For example a core may resume a session that it has established by restarting part of the protocol stack of the session that was disrupted. A core may resume a session that was established by another core by creating a copy or clone of the session in the core. In some embodiments the latter case is referred to as a reuse of the session. In these embodiments resuming a session may have a broader scope than reusing a session. In other embodiments session resume or reuse can be used interchangeably. In still other embodiments reuse refers to the reuse of some elements of a session such as security parameters of the session.

Each SSL session may be associated with a resumable indicator . The resumable indicator may be predetermined or dynamically updated. An administrator the server or a core establishing a SSL session may determine and or set an associated resumable indicator . The resumable indicator may be determined and or set via analysis of session history and or statistics such as via any algorithm or process steps. In other embodiments a core reusing the SSL session may be able to update the resumable indicator of the SSL session . In some other embodiments a core reusing the SSL session may send information to the owner of the SSL session to update the resumable indicator of the SSL session .

The resumable indicator may indicate whether a request to resume a SSL session should be allowed. The resumable indicator may indicate whether a request to resume a SSL session is allowed subject to a reuse limit and or other factors. A resumable indicator may be set based on the state of the SSL session for example whether the session is active and or is being reused by one or more cores. In one embodiment the resumable indicator may be set as non resumable when the SSL session is still active. In another embodiment the resumable indicator may be set as resumable if an inactive SSL session has not expired and or is not corrupted. In one embodiment if a fatal alert is sent or received in a SSL session the corresponding resumable indicator is set as non resumable. In some embodiments if the resumable indicator is set as non resumable all further session resume requests may be rejected or discarded.

A second core processing a request to reuse and or resume a SSL session may access the resumable indicator to determine whether the SSL session is resumable. The resumable indicator may be stored at a shared location in memory accessible by a plurality of cores. The resumable indicator may also be stored at a location in memory accessible by each core of the multi core system. In some embodiments the resumable indicator of a SSL session established by a core can be stored in the session cache of that core and or that session. The resumable indicator may be stored in a location in shared memory. The resumable indicator may be one byte in size although other embodiments are supported. In some embodiments the stored value is a pointer to a larger memory location. In other embodiments a plurality of cores e.g. cores requesting reuse of the SSL session can each store a copy of the resumable indicator . In one of these embodiments the plurality of cores having a copy of the resumable indicator may check for updates to the resumable indicator or receive a notification of an update to the resumable indicator . An update or notification may be sent as a CCM message from the first core . An update or notification may be sent to cores identified to be reusing the SSL session .

In some embodiments the packet engine stores a reuse limit to a memory module . A reuse limit is sometimes referred to as a maximum reuse threshold. This reuse limit may indicate the number of times a session can be resumed or reused. This reuse limit may be predetermined or dynamically updated. The reuse limit may be determined and set by an administrator and or via analysis of session history and or statistics such as via any algorithm or process steps. The first core may specify a reuse limit directed to the first core to the multi core system or to the SSL session established by the first core . A second core reusing a SSL session owned by the first core may specify a reuse limit directed to the second core . The reuse limit of a session for a core can be stored in the session cache of that core and or that session. The reuse limit may also be stored in a shared location in memory accessible by a plurality of cores. The reuse limit of a core may also be stored in memory partitioned or allocated for a core. In some embodiments a reuse limit may be set to limit the reuse of a session that may be inherently unstable or prone to disruption. In other embodiments a reuse limit may be set to limit cumulative and or parallel reuse of a SSL session by a plurality of cores.

In some embodiments if the resumable indicator for a session indicates that that the session is non resumable reuse of the session is not allowed. In one of these embodiments the reuse limit is removed. In another of these embodiments the reuse limit is set to zero. A core attempting to process a request to reuse and or resume a SSL session may access the reuse limit to determine whether the SSL session is reusable. If the resumable indicator for a session indicates that that the session is resumable and the reuse limit of a core and or session is not reached reuse of the session may be allowed. In some embodiments the reuse limit and the resumable indicator are determined and or set independently. In other embodiments the reuse limit and the resumable indicator are determined and or set in relation to each another. In some other embodiments the reuse limit and or the resumable indicator are determined in accordance with other factors such whether the session has expired and or is corrupted.

To resume a SSL session a client may send a request to the intermediary . The flow distributor of the intermediary can process the request and or forward the request to one of the plurality of cores. The request may include a session identifier of the SSL session identified to resume. The request may also include any information related to the session the client the server and the first core . If a second core receives the request the second core may send a message to the first core requesting for information about the SSL session . The second core can use this information about the SSL session to copy clone reconstruct duplicate mirror or otherwise create a SSL session substantially similar to the original SSL session . This process may be generally referred to as cloning a session. The SSL session is sometimes referred to as a copy of the original session or a clone of the original session .

The information about the SSL session may include one or more of protocol stack information TCP tuple information a master key a client certificate a name of a cipher a result of client authentication and an SSL version. Some or all of these information may be held in the SSL session data structure of the SSL session . The second core may access some or all of these information via the first core . Although information for generating an identical SSL session may be available in the session data structure of the SSL session a complete copy of the session data structure may not be required to clone and resume the SSL session.

In some embodiments protocol stack information may be determined from the SSL version information. In other embodiments information on the state and or components of the protocol stack such as that of drivers and agents that may be dynamically installed and or configured can be used for cloning the SSL session . The first core may use at least some portions of TCP tuple information to clone the SSL session . The first core may also obtain TCP tuple information from the request .

A first core or a packet processor of the core can use a master key for the SSL session to manage security for example data encryption and decryption and securing transactions though authorization and authentication. The master key can be applied to SSL certificates. The master key can be 48 bits long although other embodiments are also supported. In some embodiments the master key can be a Federal Information Processing Standard FIPS key such as one generated by a FIPS card. The intermediary may include a FIPS card in communication with the first core . The master key can also be created by a certificate authority CA such as a local CA residing in the intermediary . In one embodiment the CA executes on the first core and generates certificates certificate revocation lists CRLs and certificate signing requests CSRs in addition to the keys. By way of illustration and not limiting in any way one embodiment of a set of typical commands for a CA is as follows 

The second core may request some or all of the generated information from the first core to clone the SSL session . In some embodiments the second core requests a minimum set of information to reuse the SSL session . The first core may send a minimal set of information to the second core to clone the SSL session . The first core may send one or more messages containing the set of information to clone the SSL session .

The first core can use information related to the client certificate for example to determine the certificate authority status issuer identifier of the certificate and whether the certificate is valid and or revoked. Client certificate information can facilitate authentication and or authorization management in the cloned session. In some embodiments a client certificate is used to support client authentication and or SSL data insertion. In different embodiments client certificate information can be of variable size.

The name or type of a cipher including any configuration of the cipher can allow the second core to decode encode decrypt encrypt data consistent with the SSL session . Cipher information can be sent in 32 bytes of information although other embodiments can be supported. In addition client authentication results can facilitate re authentication of the client and or allow bypass of some authentication steps. Client authentication results may also be used in policy based authentication of the client such as using one or more of the policies . Client authentication results can be sent in 4 bytes of information although other embodiments can be supported.

The second core may also request for the SSL version to clone a SSL network protocol stack and or session data structure. The SSL version may also facilitate cloning of connections within the SSL network protocol stack as well as connections between any layer of the protocol stack with the client server and any other network component. SSL version information can be sent in 4 bytes of information although other embodiments can be supported. In some embodiments additional information or arguments for using the master key and or other keys can be used to clone a SSL session. For example and in one embodiment SSLv2 protocol may use a 8 bit key argument.

The first core that owns the SSL session may store information about session reuse by other cores. This information can be maintained as a bit pattern such as a bit pattern representing the cores of the multi core system in the session cache or in memory . This information may also include a reference count of cloned sessions . This information can be used for ageing the cloned sessions for timeout. On timeout of a cloned session the non owner core for example the second core may send a message to the first core indicating that the cloned session has ended. In response to this message the first core may update the stored information e.g. a reference count of cloned sessions. In one embodiment the SSL session may not be terminated if cloned sessions are active. In some embodiments each core processes session ageing irrespective of whether the SSL session is a cloned or original session. Certain operations performed by a core described herein in various embodiments may be performed by a packet engine of the core.

The non owner core may send the message to the owner core in response to a failure in session look up e.g. because the non owner core does not have access to the owner core s provisioning list and or because the non owner core cannot identify a VPN session and or license in its own provisioning list to establish an application connection. In one embodiment the non owner core may send a GetCpsEntry message e.g. CCM messages to the owner core. In one embodiment the non owner core may send a GetCpsEntry message to a default core e.g. processing element or a core determined to be the owner core. The message may include a session identifier for identifying an appropriate provisioning list an appropriate VPN session to use and or to access an appropriate license to share.

In certain embodiments one or more other cores may request a copy of the provisioning list from the owner core. The provisioning list may include an count or an indication such as a reference mask to indicate the number of cores referencing the provisioning list or having a copy of the provisioning list. The one or more other cores may maintain the copy and or update the copy if the one or more other cores is allowed to share a VPN session or license with the owner core. Each core including the owner core may update the other cores responsive to any change that affects the provisioning list e.g. establishment of an ICA connection that shares a license identified by the provisioning list. In some embodiments a non owner core may be able to update the provisioning list of an owner core. In certain embodiments a non owner core informs an owner core to update the owner core s provisioning list. The one or more other cores may communicate with the owner core e.g. via CCM or any type or form of proprietary standard and or custom protocol.

In some embodiments one or more activities that consumes a license may share a license. These one or more activities may be related to e.g. of the same user activity type and or function or independent of each other. For example and in one embodiment a user may be allowed a fixed number of activities per license granted. In some embodiments a user invoking one or more activities in association with a single domain may consume and or share a single license. A domain may identify a network a portion of a network or any network resource such as a server or website. In some embodiments a domain refers to a realm of administrative autonomy authority or control in a network such as the Internet. For example if a user requests access to a different web domain e.g. web server a separate license may be required. In some embodiments the license pool may include one or more types of licenses. Each license type may be used or shared for particular purposes and or types of activities. A license pool may include or capable of providing one or more licenses of a particular type. Licenses of a particular type may be limited and or can be shared.

One or more activities sharing a license may begin at any time relative to one another. One or more activities may be allowed to share an existing license without affecting other activities that are using the license. In some embodiments if two or more requests for a license occur simultaneously the system may process the requests sequentially or in some order e.g. by priority or as defined by a policy applied by a policy engine of the system . The system may process the requests sequentially or in a determined order so that license sharing may be processed appropriately. The one or more activities may share a license during a portion of time that the one or more activities are concurrently active. One or more activities may end or terminate earlier than the others without affecting license sharing or usage between the remaining activities.

In some embodiments a license may be shared between a VPN session and one or more application connections. In certain embodiments establishing a VPN session consumes a license. In other embodiments establishing a VPN session may not consume a license e.g. a license is consumed when an application connection is established in the VPN session . A license may be consumed or shared when an application connection is established e.g. over an existing VPN session or a newly established VPN session . The VPN session may be a full or traditional VPN session or a clientless VPN session. Clientless VPN session may be sessions that provide access e.g. to intranet sites internal file shares and remote desktops without installation of a VPN client. In some embodiments a clientless VPN session is an incomplete establishment of a VPN session. In other embodiments a clientless VPN session is an alternative to a full VPN session e.g. allowing faster establishment of the session and or circumventing client limitations. In some embodiments a clientless VPN session may consume or share a license. In other embodiments a clientless VPN session may not use a license. In some embodiments a transition between a clientless VPN session and a full VPN session does not consume an additional license usage. A license once granted may be held by at least one VPN session or application connection granted with or subsequently inheriting the license. A license may be inherited or consumed for example when a session or connection is resumed or reused.

In some embodiments establishment of a particular application connection may require a VPN session. For example and in one embodiment a user may specify application delivery via SSL VPN. In some embodiments both the application connection and VPN session may consume or share a single license. In some embodiments if the VPN session is disrupted or terminated the shared license may be returned to the license pool e.g. the application connection will be closed upon removal of the license . The license removal may occur gracefully i.e. the application connection is terminated gracefully. In other embodiments if the VPN session is disrupted or terminated the shared license may be held by a remaining application connection that is not affected by cessation of the corresponding VPN session. A VPN session may hold on to a license when some or all application connections in the VPN session are terminated. In some embodiments if a license is no longer associated with any existing or active VPN session or application connections the license is returned to the license pool. A license may be returned to the license pool responsive to the termination or expiration of the last activity session and or connection using the license. The license manager may monitor e.g. via the one or more license clients the usage and or return of licenses from the plurality of cores.

In some embodiments application delivery traffic is distributed or scaled across the multi core system to improve performance service level power and or utilization of the provisioning system. By way of illustration and not intended to be limiting in any way the following describes one embodiment of an application provisioning system e.g. in the context of a CITRIX XenApp application provisioning solution. This can be used an example upon which systems and methods of the present disclosure may be applied.

In some embodiments a user may log into a VPN vserver via a web browser from a client device . The VPN vserver may be provided by an intermediary device between one or more clients and or servers . The intermediary device may be part of a provisioning system. In some embodiments the VPN vserver incorporates one or more features of the SSL engine and or packet engine described above. In one embodiment the VPN vserver embodies the SSL engine. Upon successful login the VPN vserver may be configured to present the user with a web interface. The user may be logged into the web interface upon authentication of credentials e.g. supplied by the user. The web interface may present the user with a set of ICA or application delivery files or links and or widgets representing or identifying the ICA files. These files links and or widgets may be used to launch applications from a backend server e.g. a XenApp server.

In one embodiment when an application is launched a XenApp client executing in the client device issues or presents a secure ticket authority STA ticket. The XenApp client may be installed previously via the web interface or upon login to the VPN vserver. The STA ticket may be attached to or stored in an ICA file that the user selected to launch an application. The STA ticket may be transmitted with or by the ICA file to a STA server. The STA server may validate the STA based on the STA ticket. If the STA server validates the ticket the STA server may respond with an address identifying the application or provisioning server e.g. a XenApp server. The address may be a host name an identifier or an IP address. Using the address the VPN vserver can connect to the application or provisioning server. Upon connection the ICA client may enter application delivery mode e.g. bit pump mode .

In some embodiments a license is consumed for usage or delivery of an application service from the applications server e.g. XenApp server. In some of these embodiments each application launch for a given domain by a user consumes or uses a license. If the user launches a second application to access the same domain no additional license may be consumed. The previously consumed license may be shared. A previously shared license may be shared to establish a new application connection. If the user accesses or connects to a different domain another license may consumed. If there exists a full VPN or clientless VPN session which the user has previously established which is using a license the application connection may share this license with the VPN session. When the VPN session or the application connection terminates the license may be retained and owned by the entity that remains i.e. either the VPN session or the application connection i.e. no longer a sharing of license.

In some embodiments an application connection is started and consumes a new license. If a full VPN session is established afterwards the license is shared between the application connection and the VPN session. In certain embodiments when a VPN session is terminated the provisioning system may determine if another full or clientless VPN session is available to share a license with a remaining application connection e.g. ICA connection. The provisioning system may support a data structure or provisioning list such as a cps entry for tracking and or managing license usage in connection with VPN sessions and application connections. In certain embodiments a cps entry is a provisioning list and may be referred to as a Citrix Presentation Server CPS entry. Each cps entry may consume a license. In some embodiments one cps entry is maintained for each username user domain pair corresponding to an application connection. When a user launches an application the provisioning system may check if a cps entry is already allocated for the user s username user domain pair. If a cps entry exists a license may be available for sharing. The new application connection may be queued or stored in a linked list maintained in the CPS entry data structure. When all application connections listed in the cps entry structure are terminated the cps entry may be released or deleted from memory. Responsive to the deletion one or more licenses associated with the cps entry may released. In some embodiments licenses are released as application connections are terminated prior to deletion of a cps entry.

In some embodiments of a provisioning system incorporating a multi core system a request for an application connection may be directed to one of the cores for processing. The core may be selected based on for example the four tuple identified by the request. A provisioning list e.g. cps entry may be established in connection with the application connection. In some embodiments the selected core is designated an owner core of the requested application connection. The owner core may be responsible for creating maintaining and or managing the provisioning list. The owner core may be responsible for managing license consumption. The owner core may be responsible for releasing the provisioning list and or any license associated with the provisioning list.

In some embodiments the system is configured such that a core owning a VPN session is the owner of a corresponding provisioning list. For example and one embodiment a plurality of cores may share or access a provisioning list. The core establishing the first and or the only VPN session associated with the provisioning list may be assigned the owner core for the associated VPN session and or license. In some embodiments one of the cores e.g. processing element is configured to be the owner core of one or more VPN sessions. One provisioning list may corresponding to one VPN session. Accordingly this core can be the owner core of one or more associated provisioning lists. In certain embodiments a provisioning list may track a plurality of VPN sessions. In some embodiments an owner core of a VPN session and a provisioning list is determined based on the user of the VPN server e.g. based on a username or other identifier of the user. In certain embodiments a user of a VPN session can be identified e.g. from an identifier of the VPN session. A provisioning list may also store an identifier of a user. In one embodiment a provisioning list is created in connection with the establishment of a VPN session. Accordingly both the provisioning list and the VPN session may be identified with a user. Based on the identification of the VPN session an owner core can be determined for managing the corresponding provisioning list.

Referring now to a flow diagram depicting an embodiment of steps of a method for a VPN application provisioning proxy on a multi core system is shown. As described certain steps of this method provide an embodiment of a method for sharing licenses across resource via a multi core intermediary device. The device may be intermediary to one or more clients and or servers across one or more networks. In brief overview at step a first core of a plurality of cores may receive a request from a user to establish an application connection with a server. Prior to the request the device may grant to the one or more clients and or servers a license for a VPN session established by another e.g. second core of the plurality of cores with a client. At step the first core may determine that a provisioning list of the first core does not exist. The provisioning list may identify one or more VPN sessions and application connections associated with the first core and one or more licenses consumed by the one or more VPN sessions and application connections. At step responsive to the determination the first core may request a second core for a license to share in establishing the requested application connection. The second core may have a provisioning list identifying at least one VPN session or application connection sharing the license. At step responsive to receiving a response accepting the request to share the license the first core may establish the requested application connection. At step the first core may send to the second core a message to update the application connection in the provisioning list of the second core. At step the first core may disestablish the application connection. At step the first core may send to the second core a message to update the provisioning entry of the second core responsive to the disestablishment. At step the second core may determine whether the license is associated with at least one existing VPN session or application connection.

In further details of step the device may grant to one or more clients and or servers a license for a VPN session established by a core e.g. a first core of the plurality of cores with a client. Another core e.g. a second core of a plurality of cores may receive a request from a user to establish an application connection with a server. The user may login to a web interface for initiating a VPN session e.g. sending a request to establish the VPN session. In some embodiments a VPN session is initiated by an application based on a scheduled action or an action by a user. In one of these embodiments and by way of illustration a VPN session may be automatically established when a particular client powers up or when the client transitions from sleep mode to active mode. A VPN session may be initiated in response to an action that that involves security or uses a VPN session. For example and in one embodiment a VPN session may be initiated based on a request to establish an application connection with a server.

An intermediary device of the provisioning system may receive the request to establish the VPN session. A flow distributor of the device may receive the request and direct the request to a core of the plurality of cores. The flow distributor may select the one of the plurality of cores to process the request based on a four tuple specified by or determined from the request. The flow distributor may select the one of the plurality of cores based on an algorithm priority and or core availability e.g. via load balancing . The flow distributor may select the one of the plurality of cores based on information about the user e.g. based on a username of the user. The flow distributor may select the one of the plurality of cores based on application of a policy on information associated with the request. The flow distributor may forward the request to a pre determined core e.g. selected as a default core. For example and in one embodiment the flow distributor may forward the request to a core identified as processing element if the request is a request for establishing a VPN session.

A packet engine or SSL engine of the recipient core may initiate the VPN session responsive to the request. A provisioning manager or license client may determine whether the core has an associated provisioning list and or a license for initiating the VPN session. If a provisioning list is available the provisioning manager or license client may determine whether an existing VPN session can be used or shared to satisfy the request. If an existing VPN session can be used or shared to satisfy the request the device may allow the client access to the VPN session. If no existing VPN session is present or satisfy the request the license client may determine if the core has a license that can be used or shared in establishing a new VPN session. The license client may check the provisioning list to determine if the core has an available license. In certain embodiments the license client may check license s of the core to determine if they are assigned to or associated with a same user and or a connection to a same domain for allowing license sharing. In some embodiments the license client may perform the foregoing determinations and or checks across one or more provisioning lists of the core

The license client may determine that the core has a license available for sharing to establish the VPN session . The packet engine or provisioning manager of the core may establish the VPN session using the available license. The license client or packet engine may update the corresponding provisioning list with information about the VPN session and or the license usage. In some embodiments the license client communicates information about the license usage or sharing to a license manager of the device.

In some embodiments and or situations the license client may determine that a license is needed for establishing the VPN session . The license client may communicate with the license manager for availability of a license. In some embodiments the license client may send information e.g. user connection requested domain access to the license manager for a specific type of license. The license manager may grant the core a license for establishing a VPN session. The license manager may grant the license from a pool of licenses managed via or on the device. The license manager may grant a type of license based on the information received from the license client. The license manager may grant a license to the core if the license pool has an available license to grant or share. For example the license pool may have an available license of the requested type of license. In some embodiments the license manager may generate a license for granting to the core . In certain embodiments the license manager may grant license for sharing across one or more cores of the plurality of cores.

The packet engine may establish a VPN session if a license is available. The packet engine may establish a VPN session responsive to the grant of a license to use or share. The packet engine may establish the VPN session for a user of a plurality of users. The packet engine may establish the VPN session for access to a particular domain network component resource etc. The packet engine may establish the VPN session for an application connection e.g. to support a particular type of application connection.

The intermediary device or system may receive a request from a user e.g. via a client node operated by the user. The intermediary device or system may receive the request to access a resource. The request may be a request to access a resource of a particular domain. Any core of the plurality of cores may receive a request to establish an application connection between an application and a server or any other network resource . The same or a different core may receive the request to establish an application connection via the established VPN session. A user may send the request from a client device . For example and in one embodiment the user may initiate the request from a web browser executing on the client device . The user may login to a web interface for initiating an application connection. The user may initiate a request for establishing an application connection and or a VPN session e.g. from the web interface or from an application. An intermediary device of the provisioning system may receive the request. A flow distributor of the intermediary device may forward the request to establish an application connection to one of a plurality of cores.

The flow distributor may select the one of the plurality of cores to process the request based on a four tuple specified by or determined from the request. The flow distributor may select the one of the plurality of cores based on an algorithm priority and or core availability e.g. via load balancing . The flow distributor may select the one of the plurality of cores based on information about the user e.g. based on a username of the user. The flow distributor may select the one of the plurality of cores based on application of a policy on information associated with the request. The flow distributor may forward the request to a pre determined core e.g. selected as a default core. For example and in one embodiment the flow distributor may forward the request to a core identified as processing element . In various embodiments the recipient core may process the request for establishing the application connection by incorporating one or more steps discussed above for processing the request for establishing a VPN session.

In some embodiments the same core receives both the request to establish the VPN session and the request to establish the application connection. The same core may share a license for both the VPN session and the application connection. In this scenario the core may update its provisioning list to reflect the license sharing. In other embodiments a different or second core e.g. from the core granted a license to establish the VPN session receives the request to establish the VPN session.

In further details of step a different core e.g. second core may receive the request to establish the application connection. The core may receive a request to establish the application connection for access to a particular domain or particular domains. This core may determine that a provisioning list does not exist for the core. The core may determine that it has no license available for establishing the application connection. The core may determine that the core has no license based on the absence of a provisioning list in the core. In some embodiments the core may determine that the core has no licenses available for establishing the application connection based on the absence of a specific and or matching type of provisioning list in the core. The core may determine that the core has no licenses available for establishing the application connection based on the requested domain. The core may determine that the other core e.g. the first core owns a VPN session. The core may determine that the other core owns or has a license e.g. consumed by the VPN session and or an application connection to share. The core may determine from a provisioning list that the other core owns or has a license.

By way of illustration a packet engine of the core may receive the request from the flow distributor. The packet engine may decrypt uncompress perform protocol translation packet stripping and or otherwise process the message. The packet engine may identify or distinguish the purpose of the message e.g. to initiate establishment of a VPN session and or an application session. A provisioning engine of the packet engine may determine if a provisioning list exists for the core. The provisioning engine may determine if a provisioning list owned by the core e.g. from a plurality of provisioning lists exists. In some embodiments the provisioning engine may determine that a copy of a provisioning list exists. The provisioning engine may determine that the provisioning list corresponding to the copy is not owned by the core. The provisioning engine may determine that the provisioning list is owned by the core but does not identify a license available for sharing with the requested application connection. For example and in one embodiment the provisioning engine may determine that a license identified by the provisioning list is associated with a different domain from a domain identified by the request. The provisioning engine may determine that a license identified by the provisioning list is associated with a different user from a user identified by the request. The provisioning engine may determine that a license identified by the provisioning list is associated with a different user group from a user group identified by the request. In some of these embodiments based on the determination the method may proceed to step .

In some embodiments the provisioning engine determines that a provisioning list exists for the core and is owned by the core. The provisioning engine may determine that a license is available for sharing based on the provisioning list. The core may determine that the license is associated with the same type domain user and or user group of the requested application connection. The core may determine that the license is presently consumed by one or more VPN sessions and or application connections. In some embodiments based on the determination the packet engine may establish the requested application connection and or a VPN session for the application connection. The provisioning engine may update the provisioning list to identify the established application connection and or VPN session. The provisioning engine may update the provisioning list to associate the established application connection and or VPN session with the shared license. A license client of the packet engine may update a license manager of the provisioning system based on the established application connection and or VPN session.

In further details of step the core may request another core e.g. the first core for a license to establish the requested application connection. The core may request another core to share a license e.g. of the established VPN session. The core may request another core for a license responsive to a determination that the other core owns the VPN session and or owns a license. The core may request another core for a license responsive to a determination that the core does not own one or more of a provisioning list a VPN session and or a license. The other e.g. first core may have a provisioning list identifying at least one VPN session or application connection sharing the license. The core may identify the other core from a copy e.g. local copy of the provisioning list owned by the other core. The core may identify the other core via CCM e.g. that the other core has at least one license VPN session and or at least one provisioning list. The core may request one or more other cores for a license to share in establishing the requested application connection.

For example and in some embodiments the core may request the other core for a copy of a provisioning list owned by the other core. The core may determine if a license is available for sharing based on the copy of the provisioning list. The core may locally store the copy of the provisioning list owned by the other core. The core may store the copy of the provisioning list at a memory location allocated to the core. The core may store the copy of the provisioning list in a cache of the core. The core may determine that a license identified by the provisioning list and or the other core is available for sharing. The core may determine that the license is associated with the same domain user and or user group of the requested application connection. The core may determine that the license is presently consumed by one or more VPN sessions and or application connection.

In some embodiments while requesting another core to share a license or to access the other core s provisioning list the present core may create a temporary provisioning list. The state of the temporary provisioning list may be marked pending inactive or invalid e.g. to indicate that it is still uncertain as to whether the core can obtain a license to establish the requested application connection and or VPN session. In certain embodiments any additional requests to establish application connections and or VPN sessions are stored in the provisioning list as pending. Once the present request is processed e.g. successfully obtained a license for establishment of an application connection the pending requests may be processed sequentially in accordance with the methods described herein.

In some embodiments the other core e.g. the owner core receives the request to share the license. The owner core may determine if a license is available for sharing based on the provisioning list and or other factors described above. The owner core may determine if a license is available for sharing for access to a requested domain. The owner core may determine the first request is for access to the same domain as a VPN session of the owner core. The owner core may determine the first request is for access to the same domain as an application connection of the owner core. In certain embodiments the owner core may determine that a license is available for sharing. The owner core may send a response to the requesting core accepting the request to share the license. In some of these embodiments the method may proceed to step . In other embodiments the owner core may reject the request to share a license e.g. based on the provisioning list and or other factors described above. Based on the rejection the core may request yet another core e.g. a third core to share a license.

In some embodiments the owner core of a license may send a response indicating that a license is available for sharing. The owner core may send response as a RemoveCpsEntry message. This message may include a session identifier specified in the request. Responsive to the RemoveCpsEntry message the provisioning manager of the core receiving the message may remove the temporary provisioning list that is marked as pending inactive or invalid. The core may move any pending requests from the temporary provisioning list into another temporary provisioning list and begin processing the next pending request.

In some embodiments the core may determine that no license is available for sharing from other cores of the multi core system. The license client of the core may communicate with the license manager to generate a new license or grant a license from the license pool. If a license is available from the license pool or newly generated for use by the core in establishing the requested application connection and or VPN session the core may establish a provisioning list for this license. The packet engine of the core may establish the requested application connection and or VPN session. The provisioning manager of the core may update the provisioning list to reflect the establishment of the requested application connection and or VPN session. The provisioning manager of the core may update the provisioning list to reflect the use of the license.

In some embodiments the core may determine that no license is available e.g. for sharing from the license pool or newly generated by the license manager. The core may determine not to establish the requested application connection and or VPN session. The core may send a message to the client device and or user indicating the failure to establish the requested application connection and or VPN session. In some embodiments the core may attempt to share or request for another license sometime after the initial failure. The core may retry a number of times at certain intervals and or up to a certain number of tries.

In further details of step responsive to receiving a response accepting the request to share the license e.g. of the VPN session the packet engine e.g. of the second core may establish the requested application connection. Responsive to receiving a response accepting the request to share the license the core may establish the requested VPN session and or application connection. In some embodiments the core may identify an existing VPN session on which to establish the application connection. In one embodiment the core may establish a new VPN session prior to establishing the application connection. In some embodiments the connection with the server is established e.g. by the first or second core within a VPN session associated with the second core. The core may establish the application connection to access a requested domain. The core may establish the application connection for a user identified from a plurality of users. In some embodiments the connection with the server is established by the core in a VPN session established by the other core.

In some embodiments the core may clone an existing VPN session in another core for use by the present core. The core may clone an existing session according to any embodiments of the methods described in connection with FIGS. and A B. In certain embodiments the core may determine that the existing VPN session in the other core is not associated with any other application connections. In some embodiments the provisioning system may be configured to establish an application connection on a VPN session established and owned by the same core. In some embodiments the provisioning system may be configured to maintain a single VPN session for each user in connection with a domain. In some of these embodiments the provisioning system may be configured to have the core receiving a request to establish an application connection and or VPN session own the corresponding VPN session e.g. by creating or updating a respective provisioning list. In some of these embodiments VPN session cloning is used to establish the VPN session in the current core. VPN session cloning may be required so that the core receiving the request to establish an application connection eventually owns the corresponding VPN session. The cloned or original VPN session may be disestablished after cloning. In some embodiments cloned VPN sessions may share or reuse the same license.

In certain embodiments the core may update the copy of the provisioning list stored by the core. The core may update the copy of the provisioning list based on the established VPN session and or application connection. The core may update the copy of the provisioning list to reflect the sharing of a license with the established VPN session and or application connection. In embodiments in which the other core establishes the requested VPN session and or application connection the other core may update its provisioning list to reflect the established VPN session and or application connection and or the sharing of the license.

In further details of step the core may send to the owner core a message to update the application connection in the provisioning list of the owner core. In embodiments in which the core i.e. second core establishes the requested VPN session and or application connection the core sends a message to the owner core of the provisioning list and or license to update the provisioning list. The core may send a message via CCM to the owner core and or other cores having a copy of the provisioning list. The core may send a message via CCM to the owner core and or other cores sharing the license. The owner core may update a respective provisioning list to identify sharing of the license between the VPN session and the application connection.

In some embodiments additional requests to establish application connections and or VPN sessions may take place in accordance with any embodiment of the steps described above. In some embodiments and at any instant of time one or more application connections and or VPN sessions may be disestablished terminated or become expired these embodiments may be generally and or collectively referred to by any one of disestablished terminated and expired .

In further details of step the core e.g. second core may disestablish the application connection. In some embodiments any core sharing a license or referencing a provisioning list e.g. owning or having a copy of the same provisioning list may disestablish an application connection and or VPN session. For example the owner core may disestablish the application connection of the other core e.g. by revoking or expiring the license. The license client of the core may indicate the disestablishment of the application connection and or VPN session to the license manager. If the core is the owner core of the provisioning list the provisioning manager of the core may update the provisioning list to reflect the disestablishment of the application connection and or VPN session. If the core is not the owner core of the corresponding provisioning list the provisioning manager of the core may update its copy of the provisioning list to reflect the disestablishment of the application connection and or VPN session.

In further details of step the core may send to the owner core a message to update the provisioning list of the owner core responsive to the disestablishment. If the core is not the owner core of the provisioning list the core may send the owner core a message to update the owner core s provisioning list. Responsive the message the owner core may update the provisioning list to reflect the disestablishment. The owner core may send a message to one or more other cores referencing or relying on the provisioning list. The owner core may send a message to one or more other cores to update their copies of the provisioning list.

In some embodiments yet another core e.g. a third core of the plurality of core may receive a request e.g. a third request to establish another application connection. This core may establish the application connection responsive to receiving from an owner core a response accepting a request to share the license owned by the owner core. For example and in one embodiment the owner core may own the license because it owns an existing VPN session or an existing application connection.

In further details of step the owner core may determine whether the license is associated with at least one existing VPN session or application connection. The owner core may determine whether the license is associated with at least one existing VPN session or application connection responsive to disestablishment of an application connection and or a VPN session. The owner core may determine if the provisioning list identifies any existing or active application connections or VPN session responsive to the disestablishment. The owner core may determine that the license is associated with at least one existing VPN session or application connection. Based on the determination the license client of the owner core may continue to hold on to or use the license i.e. retain ownership of the granted license .

In some embodiments the owner core may determine that the provisioning list does not identify any existing or active application connections or VPN session. The owner core may determine that the license is not associated with any existing VPN session or application connection. Based on the determination the license client of the owner core may release or return the license to the license manager and or license pool. In some embodiments based on the determination the provisioning manager of the owner core may disestablish delete or de allocate the provisioning list.

In some embodiments if all remaining application connections and or VPN sessions of an owner core is disestablished a non owner core having an active VPN session which can be a cloned VPN session of the owner core may assume ownership of the license. In some embodiments if all remaining application connections and or VPN sessions of an owner core is disestablished a non owner core having an application connection may assume ownership of the license.

In some embodiments the intermediary device or system may maintain a VPN session for each user e.g. active user. The intermediary device or system may maintain a VPN session for each user based on an initial request from a respective user for a VPN session and or application connection. The intermediary device or system may maintain a single or specific VPN session for each user. The intermediary device or system may maintain a single or specific VPN session for access to a particular domain. In some embodiments the intermediary device or system may maintain one or more VPN sessions for each user user group and or domain.

In some embodiments TCP timeouts and or memory allocation failure may affect operation of the systems and methods described unless they are handled in certain specific ways. For example and in one embodiment a TCP timeout should be addressed before any access is allowed to a provisioning list. In this embodiment any VPN session and or application connection disestablished due to the TCP timeout should be updated into the provisioning list before allowing one or more cores to access the provisioning list. In some embodiments a memory allocation failure may prevent a CCM message to be sent out to update any copy of a provisioning list e.g. in response to a new application connection and or VPN session. The new application connection and or VPN session may be disestablished e.g. to maintain integrity in the system. In certain embodiments a memory allocation failure ma occur while creating a new provisioning list a new application connection and or VPN session. The new provisioning list new application connection and or VPN session may be disestablished e.g. to maintain integrity in the system.
