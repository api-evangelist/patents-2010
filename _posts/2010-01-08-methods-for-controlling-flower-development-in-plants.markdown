Most flowering plants produce perfect flowers containing both the male organs stamens and female organs pistils . In maize which has physically separated male and female inflorescences floral meristems become unisexual through sex determination Dellaporta Calderon Urrea 1994 Science 266 1501 Irish 1996 Bioessays 18 363 . The basic unit of the maize inflorescence called a spikelet contains one upper and one lower flower known as florets in grasses . Each floret initiates a series of floral organs including three stamen primordia and a central pistil primordium Bonnet 1940 J. Agric. Res. 60 25 Kiesselbach The Structure and Reproduction of Corn Univ. of Nebraska Press Lincoln Nebr. 1949 . These initially bisexual florets become exclusively staminate in the tassel by abortion of pistil primordia and exclusively pistillate in the ear by arrest of developing stamens Bonnet 1940 J. Agric. Res. 60 25 Cheng et al. 1983 Am. Bot. 70 450 . Each ear spikelet produces a solitary functional pistil in the upper floret due to abortion of the pistil in the lower floret Bonnet 1940 J. Agric. Res. 60 25 Kiesselbach The Structure and Reproduction of Corn Univ. of Nebraska Press Lincoln Nebr. 1949 Cheng et al. 1983 Am. Bot. 70 450 .

Mutations altering the sexual fate of florets in maize indicate that sex determination is under genetic control. The non homeotic tasselseed ts mutations ts1 and ts2 result in the conversion of the tassel inflorescence from staminate to pistillate Emerson 1920 J. Hered. 11 65 Nickerson Dale 1955 Ann. Mo. Bot. Gard. 42 195 . Both ts1 and ts2 are required to eliminate pistil primordia through cell death Calderon Urrea Dellaporta 1999 Development 126 435 Kim et al. 2007 Genetics 177 2547 . The ts2 gene encodes a short chain dehydrogenase reductase DeLong et al. 1993 Cell 74 757 with broad activity which has complicated the discovery of its natural substrate Wu et al. 2007 FEBS J. 274 1172 . It is unknown how is genes mediate pistil cell death although it has been suggested that the dehydrogenase reductase activity of ts2 may produce a pro apoptotic signal or metabolize a substrate required for cell viability Calderon Urrea Dellaporta 1999 Development 126 435 Wu et al. 2007 FEBS J. 274 1172 . Even less is known about the ts1 gene. TS2 transcripts are low or undetectable in ts1 mutant tassels which suggests that ts1 may act upstream of ts2 by regulating ts2 RNA levels and possibly other sex determination genes Calderon Urrea Dellaporta 1999 Development 126 435 .

Chemicals have been used to modulate and modify sexual differentiation in plants. The plant hormone ethylene has been observed to promote feminization in cucumber Yamasaki et al. 2005 Vitam. Bonn. 72 79 . Recent genetic and biochemical evidence has confirmed the role of ethylene in sex determination of melon a related species Boualem et al. 2008 Science 321 836 . Conversely gibberellin has masculinizing effects in cucumber but promotes feminization in maize Bensen et al. 1995 Plant Cell 7 75 and auxin also has opposing effects in cucumber and Yamasaki et al. 2005 Vitam. Horm. 72 79 . However little is known at this point about the role that chemicals play in sexual development and maturation of plants.

There is thus a great interest in identifying chemical compounds that modulate sexual differentiation in plants. Such compounds would be useful in suppressing or enhancing specific sexual phenotypes in plants allowing the control of vast groups of plants without the need for time consuming mechanical manipulation of the plants. The present invention fulfills these needs.

As used herein the articles a and an refer to one or to more than one i.e. to at least one of the grammatical object of the article. By way of example an element means one element or more than one element.

As used herein the term about will be understood by persons of ordinary skill in the art and will vary to some extent on the context in which it is used.

As used herein the term jasmonic acid derivative refers to a derivative of jasmonic acid such as but not limited to a jasmonic acid ester. The class of jasmonic acid esters includes but is not limited to a jasmonic acid alkyl ester jasmonic acid aryl ester jasmonic acid heteroaryl ester jasmonic acid aryalkyl ester and jasmonic acid heteroaryl ester. The term jasmonic acid derivative also refers to chemical compounds that give rise to jasmonic acid or other jasmonic acid derivative by chemical or microorganism based decomposition regardless whether the decomposition takes place under controlled conditions or not.

As used herein the term polypeptide refers to a polymer composed of amino acid residues related naturally occurring structural variants and synthetic non naturally occurring analogs thereof linked via peptide bonds. Synthetic polypeptides may be synthesized for example using an automated polypeptide synthesizer. As used herein the term protein typically refers to large polypeptides. As used herein the term peptide typically refers to short polypeptides. Conventional notation is used herein to represent polypeptide sequences the left hand end of a polypeptide sequence is the amino terminus and the right hand end of a polypeptide sequence is the carboxyl terminus.

As used herein the polypeptides include natural peptides recombinant peptides synthetic peptides or a combination thereof. A peptide that is not cyclic will have an N terminus and a C terminus. The N terminus will have an amino group which may be five i.e. as a NHgroup or appropriately protected for example with a BOC or a Fmoc group . The C terminus will have a carboxylic group which may be free i.e. as a COON group or appropriately protected for example as a benzyl or a methyl ester . A cyclic peptide does not necessarily have free N or C termini since they are covalently bonded through an amide bond to form the cyclic structure. The term peptide bond means a covalent amide linkage formed by loss of a molecule of water between the carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of a second amino acid.

As used herein amino acids are represented by the full name thereof by the three letter code corresponding thereto or by the one letter code corresponding thereto as indicated below 

A polynucleotide means a single strand or parallel and anti parallel strands of a nucleic acid. Thus a polynucleotide may be either a single stranded or a double stranded nucleic acid.

The term oligonucleotide typically refers to short polynucleotides which are generally not greater than about 50 nucleotides. It will be understood that when a nucleotide sequence is represented by a DNA sequence i.e. A T G C this also includes an RNA sequence i.e. A U G C in which U replaces T. 

Conventional notation is used herein to describe polynucleotide sequences the left hand end of a single stranded polynucleotide sequence is the 5 end the left hand direction of a double stranded polynucleotide sequence is referred to as the 5 direction.

The direction of 5 to 3 addition of nucleotides to nascent RNA transcripts is referred to as the transcription direction. The DNA strand having the same sequence as an mRNA is referred to as the coding strand sequences on the DNA strand which are located 5 to a reference point on the DNA are referred to as upstream sequences sequences on the DNA strand which are 3 to a reference point on the DNA are referred to as downstream sequences. 

A portion of a polynucleotide means at least about twenty sequential nucleotide residues of the polynucleotide. It is understood that a portion of a polynucleotide may include every nucleotide residue of the polynucleotide.

 Primer refers to a polynucleotide that is capable of specifically hybridizing to a designated polynucleotide template and providing a point of initiation for synthesis of a complementary polynucleotide. Such synthesis occurs when the polynucleotide primer is placed under conditions in which synthesis is induced i.e. in the presence of nucleotides a complementary polynucleotide template and an agent for polymerization such as DNA polymerase. A primer is typically single stranded but may be double stranded. Primers are typically deoxyribonucleic acids but a wide variety of synthetic and naturally occurring primers are useful for many applications. A primer is complementary to the template to which it is designed to hybridize to serve as a site for the initiation of synthesis but need not reflect the exact sequence of the template. In such a case specific hybridization of the primer to the template depends on the stringency of the hybridization conditions. Primers can be labeled with e.g. chromogenic radioactive or fluorescent moieties and used as detectable moieties.

 Probe refers to a polynucleotide that is capable of specifically hybridizing to a designated sequence of another polynucleotide. A probe specifically hybridizes to a target complementary polynucleotide but need not reflect the exact complementary sequence of the template. In such a case specific hybridization of the probe to the target depends on the stringency of the hybridization conditions. Probes can be labeled with e.g. chromogenic radioactive or fluorescent moieties and used as detectable moieties.

An isolated nucleic acid refers to a nucleic acid segment or fragment which has been separated from sequences which flank it in a naturally occurring state e.g. a DNA fragment which has been removed from the sequences which are normally adjacent to the fragment e.g. the sequences adjacent to the fragment in a genome in which it naturally occurs. The term also applies to nucleic acids which have been substantially purified from other components which naturally accompany the nucleic acid e.g. RNA or DNA or proteins which naturally accompany it in the cell. The term therefore includes for example a recombinant DNA which is incorporated into a vector into an autonomously replicating plasmid or virus or into the genomic DNA of a prokaryote or eukaryote or which exists as a separate molecule e.g. as a cDNA or a genomic or cDNA fragment produced by PCR or restriction enzyme digestion independent of other sequences. It also includes a recombinant DNA which is part of a hybrid gene encoding additional polypeptide sequence.

 Encoding refers to the inherent property of specific sequences of nucleotides in a polynucleotide such as a gene a cDNA or an mRNA to serve as templates for synthesis of other polymers and macromolecules in biological processes having either a defined sequence of nucleotides i.e. rRNA tRNA and mRNA or a defined sequence of amino acids and the biological properties resulting therefrom. Thus a gene encodes a protein if transcription and translation of mRNA corresponding to that gene produces the protein in a cell or other biological system. Both the coding strand the nucleotide sequence of which is identical to the mRNA sequence and is usually provided in sequence listings and the non coding strand used as the template for transcription of a gene or cDNA can be referred to as encoding the protein or other product of that gene or cDNA.

Unless otherwise specified a nucleotide sequence encoding an amino acid sequence includes all nucleotide sequences that are degenerate versions of each other and that encode the same amino acid sequence. Nucleotide sequences that encode proteins and RNA may include introns.

As used herein the term plant refers to a living organism belonging to the kingdom Plantae.

Administration may involve in non limiting examples direct surface application to an intact or cut portion of the plant microinjection into a tissue or cell thereof or micro bombardment preferably under low pressure.

The regimen of administration may affect what constitutes an effective amount. The formulations of the invention may be administered to the plant at any stage of its development. Preferably the formulations of the invention may be administered to the plant at the time of inflorescence development during which the sex determination process is taking place. In the case of most lines of maize this time corresponds to the period when the developing inflorescence reaches approximately 1.0 cm in height. At this stage of floral development most maize plants possess 6 8 fully expanded leaves. This precise inflorescence height and expanded leaf number vary according to variety of maize and environmental growth conditions. Further several divided dosages as well as staggered dosages may be administered daily or sequentially or the dose may be continuously administered. Further the dosages of the formulations may be proportionally increased or decreased as indicated by the exigencies of the situation.

Administration of the compositions of the present invention to a plant preferably a grass related plant more preferably maize may be carried out using known procedures at dosages and for periods of time effective to modulate the plant sexuality. An effective amount of the compound necessary to achieve the desired sexuality modulation may vary according to factors such as the nature of the plant its age status and location and the ability of the compound to modulate plant sexuality. Dosage regimens may be adjusted to provide the optimum response. For example several divided doses may be administered daily or the dose may be proportionally reduced as indicated by the exigencies of the situation. A non limiting example of an effective dose range for a compound useful within the invention is from about 0.001 to 1 000 mg kg of plant weight per day. In a non limiting example an individual plant is treated with 1 mL of a 1 mM solution of a jasmonic acid derivative and the treatment is performed three times at 48 hour intervals. One of ordinary skill in the art would be able to study the relevant factors and make the determination regarding the effective amount of the compound without undue experimentation.

Actual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the compositions of this invention may be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient that is effective to achieve the desired response for a particular plant without being toxic to the plant.

A plant specialist e.g. botanist or agricultural technician having ordinary skill in the art may readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the composition required. For example the plant specialist could start doses of the compounds useful within the invention at levels lower than that required in order to achieve the desired effect and gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved.

In one embodiment the compositions of the invention are formulated using one or more agriculturally acceptable excipients or carriers. In one embodiment the compositions of the invention comprise an effective amount of a compound of the invention and an agriculturally acceptable carrier.

In one embodiment the compositions of the invention are administered to the plant in dosages that range from one to five times at two day intervals. In another embodiment the compositions of the invention are administered to the plant in range of dosages that include but are not limited to once every day every two days every three days to once a week and once every two weeks. In another embodiment the composition of the invention is applied once to the plant as a slow release preparation. It will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art that the frequency of administration of the various combination compositions of the invention will vary from plant to plant depending on many factors including but not limited to age disease or disorder to be treated gender overall health and other factors. Thus the invention should not be construed to be limited to any particular dosage regime and the precise dosage and composition to be administered to any plant will be determined by the plant specialist based on the evaluation of the plant in question.

In one embodiment the present invention is directed to a packaged agriculturally acceptable composition comprising a container holding an effective amount of a compound of the invention alone or in combination with a second agricultural agent and instructions for using the compound to modulate plant sexuality.

The term container includes any receptacle for holding the agriculturally acceptable composition. For example in one embodiment the container is the packaging that contains the agricultural composition. In other embodiments the container is not the packaging that contains the agricultural composition i.e. the container is a receptacle such as a box or vial that contains the packaged agricultural composition or unpackaged agricultural composition and the instructions for use of the agricultural composition. Moreover packaging techniques are well known in the art. It should be understood that the instructions for use of the agricultural composition may be contained on the packaging containing the agricultural composition and as such the instructions form an increased functional relationship to the packaged product. However it should be understood that the instructions may contain information pertaining to the compound s ability to perform its intended function e.g. modulating plant sexuality.

Those skilled in the art will recognize or be able to ascertain using no more than routine experimentation numerous equivalents to the specific procedures embodiments claims and examples described herein. Such equivalents were considered to be within the scope of this invention and covered by the claims appended hereto. For example it should be understood that modifications in reaction conditions including but not limited to reaction times reaction size volume and experimental reagents such as solvents catalysts pressures atmospheric conditions e.g. nitrogen atmosphere and reducing oxidizing agents with art recognized alternatives and using no more than routine experimentation are within the scope of the present application.

It is to be understood that wherever values and ranges are provided herein all values and ranges encompassed by these values and ranges are meant to be encompassed within the scope of the present invention. Moreover all values that fall within these ranges as well as the upper or lower limits of a range of values are also contemplated by the present application.

The following examples further illustrate aspects of the present invention. However they are in no way a limitation of the teachings or disclosure of the present invention as set forth herein.

The invention is now described with reference to the following Examples. These Examples are provided for the purpose of illustration only and the invention is not limited to these Examples but rather encompasses all variations that are evident as a result of the teachings provided herein.

Wild type maize inbred lines W22 B73 and Mo17 were used. The ts1 ref allele was previously described Emerson 1920 J. Hered. 11 65 Emerson et al. 1935 Cornell Univ. Agric. Exp. Stn. Memoir 180 . ts1 69 Alex Mo17 was identified as a spontaneous mutant in Mo17 and ts1 0174 was discovered in an unknown genetic background. These three alleles were obtained from the Maize Genetics Cooperation Stock Center Maize COOP University of Illinois Urbana Champaign Ill. . The ts1 MuSH and ts1 SH04 alleles were obtained from Plant Gene Expression Center United States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service and the University of California Albany Calif. . The ts1 Mu92 and ts1 Mu93 alleles were recovered in progeny of self pollinated maize plants known to contain active Mutator Mu elements Monsanto Creve Coeur Mo. .

The remaining alleles ts1 Mu01 and ts1 Mu02 were isolated by gene tagging over the course of several generations of testcrosses of ts1 ref ts1 ref plants to Mutator lines. In brief ts1 ref mutant plants were crossed to a W22 line carrying actively transposing Mu elements. Since ts1 ref is a recessive mutation only wild type plants are expected from such a cross unless a new ts1 mutant allele is recovered in any gametes of the Mu active W22 line. About 40 000 individuals of this cross were grown during the summer seasons of 2001 and 2002. Plants showing a tasselseed phenotype potentially containing new ts1 mutant alleles were outcrossed to the W22 inbred line for at least two generations in order to segregate the new alleles and to reduce the number of active Mu elements in the genome. Additionally these F1 plants were crossed to ts1 ref mutants to confirm allelism. The ts1 linked hlm1 marker was used to distinguish the new ts1 mutant alleles from the original ts1 ref allele in the first outcrossed generation. Homozygotes for the new allele were usually obtained in the third generation by self pollinating heterozygous F2 plants.

Since the ts1 mutant plants are completely feminized the ts1 ref stock was maintained by sib mating ts1 ref ts1 ref with ts1 ref Ts1. These sib makings were used to generate the original mapping population n 93 which was selected for plants phenotypically scored as ts1 ts1 mutants. Any ts1 ref ts1 ref plant carrying one or more of the linked molecular markers in a heterozygote state were deemed to be recombinant between the heterozygous marker and the ts1 locus. Once ts1 tightly linked flanking markers were identified they were subsequently used to screen three additional testcross populations containing both heterozygote wild type plants and plants homozygous for the mutant ts1 ref allele. Two of these populations n 119 also come from the sib mating ts1 ref ts1 ref ts1 ref Ts1 while another mapping population n 208 carried a wild type Ts1 allele from the inbred W22 ts1 ref ts1 ref ts1 ref Ts1 W22 .

Candidate marker sequences were selected through genetic physical and rice maize synteny mapping. These sequences usually corresponded to a maize BAC ends or ESTs deposited in GenBank NIH Benson et al. 2008 Nucleic Acids Research 36 Database issue D25 30 or b rice genes annotated in the regions syntenic to maize intervals at Gramene Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory www dot gramene dot org . Candidate sequences were analyzed by BLAST through the TIGR Maize Database. Maize sequences corresponding to repetitive DNA were not further considered for marker design. Non repetitive DNA sequences were selected for marker development and in some cases these sequences were extended by alignment with AZM sequences TIGR .

Candidate marker sequences were PCR amplified from genomic DNA of W22 ts1 ref Ts1 and ts1 ref ts1 ref plants. In a few instances the PCR products had size polymorphisms easily resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis. In most cases however the PCR products had the same apparent size. In these cases the PCR products were sequenced and examined for the presence of SNPs. If present SNPs that represented differences in restriction enzyme recognition sites were used as CAPS Cleaved Amplified Polymorphic Sequences markers Konieczny Ausubel 1993 Plant J. 4 403 to distinguish between the different alleles in the mapping population.

New markers were initially evaluated in 20 non recombinant individuals of known phenotype to confirm co segregation of the marker with the appropriate ts1 allele. This was necessary to prevent the use of markers corresponding to a duplicate region of the ts1 interval in chromosome 10 or to repeat sequences that have escaped filtering in the repeat database. Table 1 displays the features of the molecular markers defining the ts1 genetic region.

PCR primers were designed with Primer3 Rozen Skaletsky 2000 Methods Mol. Biol. 132 365 and synthesized by the W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory Yale University New Haven Conn. . PCR based markers were routinely amplified with Tag DNA polymerase Qiagen Valencia Calif. USA in 20 L reactions containing 1 PCR buffer and 1 Q Solution supplied by the manufacturer 200 M of each dNTP 500 nM of each primer and 2.5 ng l genomic template DNA. Q Solution contains the chemical betaine which improves the amplification of DNA by reducing the formation of secondary structure in GC rich regions. The addition of Q Solution to the PCR reaction was mandatory for amplification of most maize sequences which have high GC contents. Q solution was excluded only for target sequences with 

Southern blot hybridization was performed with a published protocol Dellaporta Moreno in The Maize Handbook M. Freeling V. Walbot Eds. Springer Verlag New York 1993 pp. 569 572 except that the hybridization solution consisted of 0.25 M sodium phosphate pH 7.2 and 7 SDS as suggested by the manufacturer of the Zeta Probe GT blotting membranes Biorad Hercules Calif. USA . The hybridization probe consisted of a 624 by fragment from the ts1 W22 gene bases 2590 3213 spanning the end of exon 5 through the beginning of exon 7 and bore sufficient similarity to the duplicate ts1b gene 87 90 so that both ts1 and ts1b were detected.

Sixty four plant lipoxygenase amino acid sequences Table 2 including that of TS1 and TS1b were aligned with ClustalW2 Chema et al. 2003 Nucleic Acids Res. 31 3497 . Two different algorithms maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference were employed to estimate phylogenetic relationships of TS1 and related proteins. Maximum parsimony was implemented in PAUP 4.0b10 Swofford PAUP Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony and other methods Sinauer Associates Sunderland Mass. 1998 where the heuristic search option was applied with default values. Bootstrap values for the maximum parsimony tree were obtained by resampling 1 000 replicates under the full heuristic search method. Bayesian inference was performed with MrBaycs 3.1.2 Huelsenbeck Ronquist 2001 Bioinformatics 17 754 with a mixed amino acid substitution model four independent chains run for 5 000 000 generations and sampling every 1000th tree. Convergence was estimated when the standard deviation of split frequencies reached a plateau approaching zero and the consensus tree was determined with a burn in of 25 1250 trees .

Maize plants from inbred line W22 were grown in the greenhouse. All tissue samples used for qRT PCR assays were quickly dissected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Approximately 100 mg of frozen tissue were ground in a mortar and pestle and quickly re suspended in 1 nil of Trizol Reagent Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. USA . Developing inflorescences between 0.8 and 3 cm in length were directly placed in 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes resuspended in 1 nil of Trizol reagent and ground with a plastic pestle attached to a table top drill press. Total RNA was isolated according to manufacturer s recommendations and re suspended in water previously treated with diethylpyrocarbonate DEPC Sigma St. Louis Mo. USA containing 20 units of Protector RNase Inhibitor Roche Indianapolis Ind. USA .

Prior to cDNA synthesis 1 g of total RNA was treated with 1 unit of DNase I Amplification Grade Invitrogen in a 10 l reaction containing 1 DNase I buffer supplied by the manufacturer. The reaction proceeded for 15 minutes at room temperature and the enzyme was inactivated by adding 1 l of 25 mM EDTA and heating at 65 C. for 10 min The DNase treated RNA 1 g was directly used in cDNA synthesis with the SuperScript 111 First Strand Synthesis SuperMix for qRT PCR Invitrogen following the manufacturer s instructions. The 2 RT Reaction Mix included both oligo dT 20 and random hexamers to prime the reverse transcription reaction The cDNA was diluted to 100 l with 1 TE and stored at 80 C. PCR reactions were performed in optical 96 well plates with a 7500 Fast Real Time PCR System sequence detection system Applied Biosystems Foster City Calif. USA . Reactions contained 1 Power SYBR Green Master Mix reagent Applied Biosystems 300 nM of each gene specific primer Table 3 and 1 l of diluted cDNA in a final volume of 25 l. The standard thermal profile recommended by the manufacturer of the PCR master mix was followed. Three technical PCR replicates were set up for each one of the three biological replicates of each tissue sample. qRT PCR data were normalized with actin1 as a reference gene.

Primers P1930 5 CCTCTCAGTACCGACAGACAGC 3 SEQ ID NO 15 and P1931 5 CCATTCAGTTCCTCACAGTCTTGC 3 SEQ ID NO 16 were used to amplify a 217 by fragment of the ts1 gene corresponding to part of the 3 UTR. The PCR product was cloned into the pCRII TOPO vector Invitrogen generating pYU 1672 the plasmid used for synthesis of the ts1 in situ probe. The ts2 in situ hybridization probes have been previously described DeLong et al. 1993 Cell 74 757 and are contained in the plasmids pYU59 and pYU60.

In situ hybridizations were performed as described D. Jackson in Plant Molecular Pathology A Practical Approach S. J. Gurr M. J. McPherson D. J. Bowles Eds. Oxford University Press Oxford 1992 vol. I pp. 163 174 with modifications as described Bortiri et al. 2006 Plant Cell 18 574 . Three additional modifications were adopted a no RNase treatment was performed after hybridizations b the anti DIG antibody was diluted 1 1000 and incubated for 2 hr at room temperature c the buffer used for color detection included 10 polyvinyl alcohol PVA to increase reaction sensitivity.

The mCherry gene was PCR amplified with PfuUltra High Fidelity DNA Polymerase Stratagene La Jolla Calif. USA from the pREST B mCherry vector S12 with primers P2672 5 eggggtaccccATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAGGAT 3 SEQ ID NO 17 and P2673 5 ctagtctagatggatceCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCCGCC 3 SEQ ID NO 18 which added KpnI NcoI and BamHI XbaI sites respectively lower case letters in primer sequences . The PCR product did not contain the endogenous stop codon Instead P2673 provided a new stop codon in the XbaI site downstream of the BamHI site. The PCR product was digested with KpnI and XbaI and the 733 by KpnI XbaI mCherry fragment was gel purified. Plasmid pYU1721 was derived from the plant expression vector pRTL2 Restrepo et al. 1990 Plant Cell 2 987 and contained the full length ts1 CDS without the stop codon ts1 STOP fused in frame with the gene encoding the monomer Red Fluorescent Protein mRFP1 construction details are available upon request . pYU1721 was digested with KpnI and XbaI to release the mRFP1 gene. The remaining 6.5 kb plasmid containing pRTL2 plus the ts1 STOP CDS was gel purified and ligated to the 733 by KpnI XbaI mCherry gene. The resulting plasmid pYU1743 was shown by sequencing to contain an in frame N terminus fusion of the ts1 STOP CDS to the mCherry gene.

One microgram of plasmid DNA was precipitated on gold particles 1.0 m Biorad essentially as described Kleinet et al. 1987 Nature 327 70 Onion L. bulbs were cut in small pieces. The epidermal cell layers were carefully peeled and transferred to the surface of Petri dishes containing Murashige and Skoog basal medium MS from Invitrogen or Sigma Aldrich St. Louis Mo. USA solidified with 3.5 Phytagel Sigma Aldrich . Epidermal cell layers were bombarded with a Biolistic PDS1000 He Particle Delivery System Biorad with 1350 psi rupture discs. After bombardment the plates were incubated at 27 C. in darkness for 8 20 h. The epidermal cell layers were then stained for 10 minutes in 1 g ml DAPI dissolved in 1 PBS then washed for 10 minutes in 1 PBS and mounted in glass slides with 70 glycerol in 1 PBS.

Transformed cells were examined by epifluorescence microscopy with an Axioplan 2 microscope Carl Zeiss Microimaging Thornwood N.Y. USA with the appropriate excitation emission filters. Differential Interference Contrast DIC or Nomarski microscopy was used to visualize cells under transmitted light. Digital images were captured with a Zeiss Axiocam with several Image Acquisition Modules of the Zeiss Axiovision software. The Multichannel Fluorescence module allowed the sequential acquisition of DAPI GFP mCherry and DIC images for each sample. The onion epidermal cell layer is very thick and not all cell features appear in the same focal plane. Therefore a series of images over a defined z focus range were acquired with the Z Stack module of Axiovision. This module automatically calculated the distance between individual images of the z stack to achieve the maximum axial resolution of the objective used. The Z stack was reconstructed with the 3D Deconvolution module where the Regularized Inverted Filter RIF method was used. Final image display was completed by applying a maximum intensity projection MIP over the entire image volume within the context of the orthogonal slice view Cut View . The Colocalization module was used to quantitatively assess the colocalization of the TS1 mCherry red fluorescent signal along with the RbcSnt GFP green fluorescent signal.

The molecular marker hlm1 was isolated from the flanking sequence of a Mu4 element that was identified as tightly linked to the ts1 Mu92 mutation. The hlm1 marker was mapped approximately 1 cM from ts1 in a small testcross population n 93 segregating for the ts1 ref allele. The maize ZMMBBb BAC library CUGI was probed with hlm1 and six BAC clones from contig 78 of the current maize physical map Arizona Genomics Institute were identified. A marker within this contig umc2251 was tested for linkage and found to map distal to both ts1 and hlm1 8 and 9 cM respectively . Therefore the genetic interval containing ts1 was initially defined as a 9 cM region by the proximal hlm1 and the distal umc2251 markers. To further refine this interval BAC end sequences in the physical region proximal to umc2251 were analyzed for potential low copy sequences. A molecular marker designed from the end sequence of BAC b0148G01 CC760183 was tested and found to map 1 cM distal to ts1 . A larger mapping population total n 420 was analyzed with CC760183 and hlm1 and a total of 3 distal and 4 proximal recombinants to ts1 were detected. This analysis placed ts1 within a 1.6 cM genetic interval defined by the proximal hlm1 and the distal CC760183 markers which spanned a physical region of 500 kb .

A genomic sequence AZM4115428 corresponding to hind was identified in the TIGR AZM 4.0 assembly of the maize methyl filtered and high Cot genomic libraries which consists of sequences highly enriched for coding regions Palmer et al. 2003 Science 302 2115 Whitelaw et al. 2003 Science 302 2118 . Orthologs of CC760183 and AZM4115428 were annotated in the rice genome delineating a 62 kb syntenic region that contained 9 predicted genes.

The ts1 gene was thus located in a region with extensive synteny with rice Salse et al. 2004 Plant J. 38 396 . Out of the nine genes contained in the ts1 syntenic interval within the sequenced genome of rice no maize orthologs were found for four of these genes and another three were mapped to locations unlinked to the ts1 locus in maize. Maize homologs of the remaining two rice genes one encoding a putative glutamate decarboxylase and the other encoding a putative lipoxygenase were confirmed to be contained within the ts1 physical interval .

Sequencing showed that the gene encoding glutamate decarboxylase was monomorphic whereas the gene encoding lipoxygenase in the ts1 ref line showed an 864 base pair bp insertion in the predicted first exon with complete linkage with the ts1 phenotype in mapping populations. To confirm that the lipoxygenase corresponded to the ts1 gene eight ts1 mutant alleles were analyzed. Each contained an independent mutation in the gene encoding lipoxygenase and Table 3 . Complementary DNA sequence analysis showed that the ts1 gene contains seven exons with a coding sequence of 2757 by . A closely related gene was also identified in the database of the TIGR AZM 4.0 assembly and by Southern blot analysis . This gene named ts1b has an identical exon intron structure to that of ts1 and shares 93 nucleotide similarity. The ts1b gene is located on maize chromosome 10S a segmental duplication of chromosome 2S Gaut 2001 Genome Res. 11 55 . The TS1 protein displays 38 to 60 similarity to plant lipoxygenases and contains two conserved domains characteristic of this family a beta barrel cd01751 and a catalytic helical bundle pfam00305 Shibata Axelrod 1995 J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 12 213 and .

Lipoxygenases are non heme iron containing fatty acid dioxygenases that catalyze the peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic acid linolenic acid and arachidonic acid. They are classified according to the positional specificity of linoleic acid oxygenation which occurs at carbon 9 of the hydrocarbon backbone for the 9 LOX types and at carbon 13 for the 13 LOX types a further subdivision classes 1 and 2 has been recognized for 13 lipoxygenases without or with a putative chloroplast transit peptide cTP respectively Feussner Wasternack 2002 Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 53 275 . According to ChloroP a neural network based method for predicting cTPs the N terminal 48 amino acids of the TS1 protein contain a cTP Emanuelsson et al. 1999 Protein Sci. 8 978 and . Additionally TS1 contains a conserved phenylalanine Phe636 previously identified as a determinant of 13 LOX regiospecificity Hornung et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 96 4192 Liavonchanka Feussner 2006 J. Plant Physiol. 163 348 . Therefore the primary structure of TS1 suggests that it is a member of the class 2 plastid localized 13 lipoxygenases. This prediction was supported by Bayesian and maximum parsimony phylogenetic analyses of plant lipoxygenases which placed TS1 and TS1b in a Glade including characterized and predicted class 2 13 lipoxygenase and .

The tissue specific expression of both ts1 and ts1b was established by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction RT PCR analysis of root stem leaf tassel and ear transcripts. The ts1 RNA was detected in all maize tissues examined whereas ts1b RNA was detected at very low levels less than that of ts1 by a factor of 90 to 500 . The low expression of ts1b may explain why it does not also appear to be a component of sex determination in ts1 mutant plants. The broad expression of ts1 was unexpected because its mutant phenotype suggests a sex specific function. Although no alterations in other tissues have been reported it is possible that additional phenotypes for the ts1 mutation may be uncovered by more careful analyses. The ts2 gene was expressed almost as broadly as ts1 except in stem tissue where expression was less than that of ts1 by a factor of 35.

In situ hybridization showed that TS1 transcripts form stripes following the borders of the central inflorescence axis and projecting toward the spikelet attachment points In spikelet adaxial views TS1 expression domains surround the spikelets delineating their base . None of these expression patterns were observed in a homozygous ts1 Mu01 deletion mutant line containing a functional ts1 b gene . These observations indicate that TS1 transcripts subtend maize spikelets at their junction with the central inflorescence axis rachis . This expression domain suggests a function for TS1 as metabolites synthesized through the lipoxygenase encoded by ts1 could act as diffusible signals affecting floral development in a non cell autonomous fashion.

The ChloroP based prediction that TS1 localizes in plastids was confirmed with a fluorescent tagged TS1 protein TS1 mCherry and a plastid localized RbcSnt GFP protein Lee et al. 2002 Mol. Cells. 14 388 . To quantitatively assess the colocalization of RbcSnt GFP and TS1 mCherry fluorescent signals correlation analysis of the intensity values of color green and red pixels in the dual channel image was performed. Specifically the Colocalization module in the Axiovision software Carl Zeiss Microimaging Thornwood N.Y. USA plotted the pixel grey values of fluorescent intensity of the x axis and y axis channels against each other . Then correlation coefficients were calculated to measure the strength of the linear relationship between the two variables Bolte Cordelieres 2006 J. Microsc. 224 213 Manders et al. 1992 J. Cell Sci 103 857 . The images in showed a Manders overlap coefficient of 0.986 strongly indicating colocalization between the two signals. Additionally weighted co localization coefficients M1 and M2 which are independent of differences in fluorescence intensity between the two channels were calculated. For TS1 mCherry M2 0.906 indicating that a high proportion of red signal coincided with a signal in the green channel over its total intensity Bolte Cordelieres 2006 J. Microsc. 224 213 Manders et al. 1992 J. Cell Sci. 103 857 . A similar conclusion was drawn for the weighted co localization coefficient of RbcSnt GFP M1 0.903 indicating that TS1 mCherry protein is targeted to the same subcellular compartment as RbcSnt GFP. TS1 is thus targeted to plant plastids.

Frozen tassels were ground in liquid nitrogen and or homogenized in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube with 1 to 2 volumes of ice cold 0.1 M Tris buffer pH 7.5 containing 0.1 M NaCl 5 mM EDTA 0.1 mercaptoethanol 0.6 Triton X 100 1 mM PMSF and EDTA free Protease Inhibitors Roche Indianapolis Ind. USA The mixture was clarified by centrifugation at 14 000 g for 30 minutes at 4 C. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and total protein concentration estimated with the Micro BCA Protein Assay Kit Pierce Rockford Ill. USA 

Aliquots of crude protein extracts were added to 3 ml of potassium phosphate buffer pH 6.0 containing 150 M linoleic acid and stirred at 23 C. for 15 min. Peroxidation products were reduced to hydroxides HOD by adding 12 ml of a solution of 5 mg ml SnClin ethanol and incubating for another 5 minutes at 23 C. Products isolated by extraction with diethyl ether were methyl esterified and analyzed by GC MS and HPLC. For all analyses reference oxylipins of high chemical purity Larodan Fine Chemicals Malm Sweden were used. Material to be analyzed by GC MS was derivatized by treatment with trimethylchlorosilane hexamethyldisilazane pyridine 2 1 2 v v v at room temperature for 15 min. Excess reagent and solvent were removed in vacuo and the residue was resuspended in hexane. GC MS was carried out with a mass selective detector Hewlett Packard model 5970B Avondale Pa. USA connected to a gas chromatograph Hewlett Packard model 5890 equipped with a capillary column of 5 phenylmethylsiloxane 12 m 0.33 m film thickness . Helium was used as the carrier gas and the column temperature was raised from 120 C. to 300 C. at 10 C. min.

SP HPLC of methyl esterified incubation products was carried out with a column of Nucleosil 50 5 250 4 6 mm purchased from Macherey Nagel D ren Germany and a solvent system of 0.6 2 propanol hexane at a flow rate of 2 ml min. The absorbance 234 nm and radioactivity of HPLC effluents were determined on line with a Spectromonitor III ultraviolet detector Laboratory Data Control Riviera Beach Fla. USA and a liquid scintillation counter IMUS Systems Tampa Fla. USA respectively. Under the conditions used the elution order of hydroxyoctadecadienoates were methyl 13 hydroxy 9 Z 11 E octadecadienoate first methyl 13 hydroxy 9 E 11 E octadecadienoate methyl 9 hydroxy 10 E 12 Z octadecadienoate and methyl 9 hydroxy 10 E 12 E octadecadienoate last .

Biochemical analysis of protein extracts from developing tassels for activity on the lipoxygenase substrate linoleic acid suggests that TS1 is capable of lipid peroxidation. Protein extracts from wild type tassels catalyzed hydroperoxidation of linoleic acid whereas no such activity was detected in mutant ts1 ref ts 1ref developing tassels . Mass spectrometry MS and high performance liquid chromatography HPLC analyses showed that the products of this lipoxygenase activity are a mixture of 9 and 13 hydroperoxides in a 50 50 ratio primary structure analysis had suggested that TS1 was a lipoxygenase with 13 regiospecifieity. Therefore it is possible that TS1 possesses dual 9 and 13 regiospecificity which has not previously been described for a plastid localized lipoxygenase or that TS1 function promotes the action of a separate 9 lipoxygenase.

Class 2 13 lipoxygenases participate in the biosynthesis of the plant hormone jasmonic acid JA Wasternack 2007 Ann. Bot. 100 681 . The involvement of TS1 in JA biosynthesis was evaluated by measuring endogenous JA levels in developing wild type and ts1 ref ts1 ref mutant tassels.

As shown in the first dedicated step in jasmonate biosynthesis is the peroxidation of linolenic acid 18 3 by 13 lipoxygenase to form 13S hydroperoxyoetadecatrienoic acid 13 HPOT . This is the putative function of TS1. 13 HPOT is transformed into the specific stereoisomer cis 12 oxophytodienoic acid OPDA through the sequential action of allene oxide synthase yielding 13S 12 13 epoxy oetadecatrienoic acid 12 13 EOT and allene oxide cyclase. These steps in JA biosynthesis occur in plant plastids where the corresponding enzymes are localized. Subsequent reactions occur in the peroxisomes. First the cyclopentenone ring of OPDA is reduced to 12 oxophytoenoic acid OPC 8 by OPDA reductase. Next three oxidation cycles are proposed to shorten the carboxylic side chain of OPC 8 to produce the 12 carbon JA. A oxidation cycle is a set of four enzymatic reactions oxidation hydration oxidation and thiolysis. Not all enzymes acting on oxidation during JA biosynthesis have been identified. Because the oxidation in the third step is normally performed by a dehydrogenase activity it is possible that TS2 may participate in this step of JA biosynthesis.

Maize plants of W22 ts1 ref ts1 ref and ts1 ref were field grown during the summer of 2007. Developing tassel inflorescences between 0.8 and 3 cm in length were quickly dissected placed in 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissue samples were stored at 80 C. prior to solvent extraction. Jasmonic acid quantification was performed with vapor phase extraction for sample preparation and chemical ionization gas chromatography mass spectrometry CI GC MS as described Sehmelz et al. 2004 Plant J. 39 790 . Descriptive and comparative statistics were obtained with Analyse it Standard edition Analyse it Software Ltd Leeds England an add in for Microsoft Excel.

The average concentration of JA in wild type and ts1 ref heterozygotes was 44.2 T 13.9 ng per gram of fresh weight ng g FW and 40.3 T 20.2 ng g FW respectively . Homozygous ts1 ref ts1 ref tassels showed an average JA concentration of 4.3 T 2.1 ng g FW significantly below that of the wild type in a Kruskal Wallis test and pair vise comparisons with a Bonferroni correction P

Maize plants were grown under greenhouse conditions. Two seeds were planted in 2 gallon reusable pots containing Super Fine Germinating Mix Fafard Agawam Mass. USA or Redi earth Professional Growing Mix Sun Gro Bellevue Wash. USA . Fertilization was performed with controlled release Osmocote Plus 15 9 12 Scotts Marysville Ohio USA following the manufacturer recommendations. Additional watering was performed with 4 ammonium iron citrate Sigma Aldrich every 2 weeks to prevent chlorosis. Greenhouse average temperatures were 28 C. day and 21 C. night . Supplemental lightning was provided to achieve a 16 8 hour photoperiod yearlong.

Tassels of about 1 cm were considered to be at an ideal stage to initiate chemical treatments. Since a thick leaf whorl covers the maize tassel at this time of development only a destructive dissection of the plant permits to assess with certainty the stage of tassel development Bonnet 1940 J. Agricult. Res. 60 25 Bonnet 1948 Ann. Mo. Bot. Gard. 35 269 . Additionally the sex determination phase was reached within a wide time window between 28 and 46 days post planting depending on the growing conditions. Leaf number node number or internode distance were not always reliable criteria to predict the tassel developmental stage.

Seedlings from a family segregating 1 1 for wild type ts1 ref Ts1 and ts1 mutant ts1 ref ts1 ref plants were genotyped for the Ts1 and ts1 ref alleles with a PCR based assay. Forty six days after planting one ts1 and one heterozygote plant showing 6 8 fully expanded leaves were dissected and their tassels were shown to be approximately 1.0 cm in height. This was used as a rough estimate indicating that similar plants as judged by height and leaf number were at the right stage to receive chemical treatments. Jasmonic acid JA Sigma Aldrich was dissolved at a concentration of 200 mM in absolute ethanol and stored at 20 C. Prior to plant treatment the JA stock solution was diluted to a concentration of 1 mM in deionized water. Control plants were treated with a 0.005 ethanol solution blank treatment or negative control . One ml of the corresponding solution was applied into the apical leaf cavity of each plant. Treatments were performed three times at 48 hour intervals.

The developmental timing of the pistil abortion process occurs in tassel inflorescences when they are 1.0 to 3.0 cm in length Irish Nelson 1993 Am. J. Bot. 80 292 which was also the stage at which ts1 expression occurred in the subtending glumes . A 0.005 ethanol solution with or without 1 mM JA was applied to tassels of 1 cm in wildtype ts1 ref or ts1 mutant ts1 ref ts1 ref sibling plants. In ts1 mutant plants JA application reversed feminization as evidenced by the presence of staminate spikelets mostly in the mid to apical regions . Wildtype rescue in ts1 mutants was observed in the appearance of subtending floral bracts glumes about 3 to 4 weeks after treatment. JA treated glumes in ts1 mutants were elongated were covered with numerous trichomes and had a ring of anthocyanin deposited at the base all three characteristics of wild type staminate spikelets. Later in floral development stamens emerged from JA treated ts1 mutant spikelets .

Staminate florets from rescued IA treated ts1 ts1 plants produced viable pollen which was used for both self pollination and test crosses to untreated ts1 ts1 mutant sibs. All test cross progeny n 100 were homozygous for the ts1 ref allele and displayed a complete ts1 mutant phenotype. The JA rescued phenotype of the tassel inflorescence was incomplete in that some spikelets were bisexual containing both pistils and stamens and others mainly those located at the base of the inflorescence were pistillate. These effects however may have been due to the timing of JA treatments because the stage of floral maturation differs in a positionally dependent fashion throughout the inflorescence. Rescued staminate spikelets were never observed in blank treated ts1 ref ts1 ref plants and Table 4 nor did JA treatment affect heterozygous ts1 ref sibs Table 4 . The similar phenotype of ts1 and ts2 mutations indicates that both genes may act in the same metabolic pathway. Therefore JA was also applied to mutant ts2 ref ts2 ref and ts2 ref plants which responded in the same manner as the JA treated ts1 mutants and Table 4 . These results indicate that JA can restore the wild type phenotype in both ts1 and ts2 mutant plants. Moreover TS2 may have an unexpected role in IA biosynthesis perhaps as one of the yet unidentified enzymes catalyzing a series of oxidations in this metabolic pathway .

Genes regulating meristem determinacy early in maize inflorescence development are expressed at the boundary of the meristem and the inflorescence axis rather than within the meristem itself. These genes such as ramosa1 ramosa3 and barren stalk1 Gallovatti et al 2004 Nature 432 630 Satoh Nagasawa et al. 2006 Nature 441 227 Vollbrecht et al. 2005 Nature 441 227 probably act non cell autonomously by producing a diffusible signal at the base of the meristem Vollbrecht et al. 2005 Nature 441 227 . Analogously ts1 expression at the boundary of developing spikelet initials and inflorescence axis produce the hormone JA which may diffuse within the spikelet to regulate sexual development. This situation parallels JA mediated anther dehiscence in Arabidopsis where JA biosynthetic genes are highly expressed in the anther filament where it signals development both in the filament and within the anther Ishiguro et al. 2001 Plant Cell 13 2191 Sanders et al. 2000 Plant Cell 12 1041 . The expression of ts2 is known to be reduced in ts mutants Calderon Urrea Dellaporta 1993 Development 126 435 . The finding that ts2 may be involved in the same biosynthetic pathway as ts1 is not necessarily at odds with previous observation as most genes encoding enzymes of the JA biosynthetic pathway are transcriptionally up regulated by JA in a characteristic positive feedback loop Wasternack 2007 Ann. Bot. 100 681 .

JA signals plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses Wasternack 2007 Ann. Bot. 100 68 and regulates plant developmental processes such as root growth Staswicknet al. 1992 PNAS U.S.A. 89 6837 and mechanotransduction Weiler et al. 1993 Phytochemistry 32 591 . In Arabidopsis JA is required for male fertility because pollen maturation and anther dehiscence are blocked in mutations that impair JA biosynthesis Ishiguro et al. 2001 Plant Cell 13 2191 Sanders et al. 2000 Plant Cell 12 1041 . JA may promote anther dehiscence by signaling degeneration of the stomium a group of specialized cells that run along the length of the anther and are necessary for dehiscence Sanders et al. 1999 Sex Plant Reprod. 11 297 . The present results imply a role for JA in maize sex determination wherein JA is necessary for signaling the tasselseed mediated pistil abortion and the acquisition of the male characteristics of staminate spikelets. The diverse mechanisms of hormonal control in plant sex determination support the notion that the systems have evolved independently multiple times Ainswortyh et al. 1998 Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 38 167 .
