The invention relates in general to ballistic munitions and in particular to fin stabilized ballistic projectiles.

Military organizations have a growing demand for precision guided munitions. In contrast to traditional spin stabilized ballistic munitions a fin stabilized projectile relies on fins in its base to sustain stability and maneuverability during flight. Deploying fins on a projectile from a tube launched environment is a difficult task requiring much engineering design and analysis. A projectile experiences high loads and large accelerations during a ballistic gun launch. Upon exiting the muzzle the projectile needs a simple and reliable fin deployment method.

In addition to the gun launch and deployment constraints fins also must perform their intended function of maintaining aeroballistic stability of the projectile. Maintaining stability requires the fins to have a specific geometry and method of intrusion into the airstream. The fins must obtain a specific center of pressure for aeroballistic stability and maneuverability over the entire flight mission.

A need exists for a reliable fin deployment method and apparatus that maintains the aeroballistic stability of a projectile.

It is an object of the invention to provide a reliable fin deployment method and apparatus that maintains the aeroballistic stability of a projectile.

One aspect of the invention is a projectile that may include a body and a base assembly fixed to a rear end of the body. The base assembly may include a base a spacer a fin mount a gas cavity and an opening extending from a rear end of the base to the gas cavity. A retention nut may be engaged with the base. The retention nut may secure the fin mount and spacer to the base. A retention plug may be disposed in the opening in the base assembly. The retention plug may include at least one gas conduit between an outer surface of the retention plug and the gas cavity. A retention bolt may extend through the retention plug and may be fixed to the base.

A plurality of fins hubs may be rotatably fixed to the base. Each fin hub may include a yoke. A plurality of fins may be movably connected to respective ones of the plurality of fin hubs. Each fin may include a slot formed therein. Each fin may be inserted in the yoke of a respective fin hub and connected to the respective fin hub by fasteners movably disposed with respect to the slot and fixed to the yoke. The plurality of fin hubs and fins may have a stowed position and a deployed position.

A retention disk may be disposed in openings in each of the plurality of fins. The retention disk may be fixed in place by the retention bolt.

Each slot may include a central portion that is substantially parallel to a longitudinal axis of the projectile when the fins are in the stowed position and front and rear portions that are substantially perpendicular to the central portion. With respect to the longitudinal axis of the projectile the rear portion of each slot may be radially distant from the front portion of each slot.

The number of the fasteners that movably connect each fin to each fin hub may be two. In the stowed position of the fins a first of the two fasteners may be disposed in the rear portion of the slot and a second of the two fasteners may be disposed in the central portion of the slot. In a deployed position of the fins the first of the two fasteners may be disposed in the central portion of the slot and the second of the two fasteners may be disposed in the front portion of the slot.

The retention disk may include a plurality of slots formed therein. When the fins are in the stowed position a portion of each fin may be disposed in a respective one of the slots.

An obturator groove may be formed in the base. A rear side of the obturator groove may be defined by the spacer.

A spring lever may be disposed in each yoke. The spring lever may have one end fixed to the fin hub and a free end. Each fin may include a notch formed on a front surface. The free end of the spring lever may be disposed in the notch when the fin is in the deployed position.

Another aspect of the invention is a method that may include providing a projectile igniting propellant and filling a gas cavity in a base assembly of the projectile with gas produced by combustion of the propellant. When the projectile exits the gun tube the method may include fracturing a retention bolt and moving a retention plug out of an opening in the base assembly. The method may include moving fin hubs to a deployed position and translating fins with respect to the fin hubs.

Moving the fin hubs to the deployed position may include rotating the fin hubs with respect to a fin mount and not translating the fin hubs with respect to the fin mount. After moving the fin hubs and translating the fins the fin hubs and the fins may be locked in the deployed position. Translating the fins may include moving two fasteners through a slot.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

A fin deployment apparatus may support the rear fins of a projectile. A fin deployment apparatus may maintain the rear fins in a stowed configuration until the entire projectile has exited the gun tube muzzle. After exiting the muzzle a fin deployment apparatus may function by using the differential pressure between a pressurized gas cavity of the fin deployment apparatus and the atmosphere surrounding the fin deployment apparatus. The differential pressure may shear a bolt and or push a plug out of and away from a base thereby releasing and deploying the stabilizing fins. The plug may have an aerodynamic shape to ensure that it does not return to the gun site and inflict damage to the crew or equipment.

Once released the fins may then mechanically lock at a desired angle from the base. It may be necessary for the fins to be released simultaneously due to the naturally marginal level of stability in some precision artillery. The marginal stability may be required to ensure adequate maneuverability of the projectile throughout its flight and in its terminal flight phase.

A fit between retention plug and opening may be such that propellant gas pressure in gas cavity forces retention plug out of opening . For example the fit between plug and opening may be a press type of fit with an overlap of for example about 0.001 inches. Retention plug may include at least one gas conduit see also between an outer surface of retention plug and gas cavity . In one embodiment there may be four gas conduits spaced about ninety degrees apart.

After ignition of propellant the high pressure propellant gases may fill gas cavity via conduits before projectile exits gun tube . The pressure of the propellant gases in tube may be for example about 20 000 psi. When projectile exits tube the high pressure gas in cavity may force plug out of opening . Movement of plug rearwardly causes fins to rotate open as will be explained in more detail.

A plurality of fins may be rotatably fixed to base . Fins may comprise for example steel. Fins may have a folded position as in and a deployed position as in . Each fin may include a tab disposed on an inner edge of the fin . Each fin may include an opening for receiving a fin shaft .

Fins may be maintained in the folded position with a retention screw that may interact with tabs . Retention screw may be adjustably disposed in a rear end of retention plug . For example retention screw may be threaded into rear end of plug . Retention screw may include a head .

In the position shown in tabs may be disposed beneath forward of head . Retention screw may be threaded inwardly to bear against tabs and thereby maintain fins in the folded position. A gap may exist between forward edges of tabs and rear end of plug . The gap allows the fins to be unlocked as plug and retention screw move rearward after projectile exits gun tube .

Retention plug may include a plurality of slots formed therein. When fins are in the folded position a portion of each fin may be disposed in a respective one of the slots . A forward edge of each slot may be curvilinear. A forward edge of each fin may be linear. Alternatively a forward edge of each fin ma be curved.

Base may include a slot and a fin shaft opening for each fin . Fin deployment apparatus may further include a fin shaft FIGS. and A B connected to each fin . Fin shafts may be rotatably disposed in fin shaft openings in base . Each fin shaft may include an opening for housing a spring loaded pin .

After projectile exits the gun muzzle plug with attached retention screw may move rearward. Fins may first be unlocked by movement of retention screw away from tabs . As plug moves further rearward fins may rotate outwardly around fin shafts . When fins have completed their outward rotation deployed position of spring loaded pins may extend outwardly into recesses formed adjacent fin shaft openings in base . Extension of the spring loaded pins into recesses may lock fins in the deployed position.

Another embodiment of a fin deployment apparatus is shown in . are perspective end side and sectional views respectively of fin deployment apparatus with its fins and fin hubs in a stowed or folded position. Fin deployment apparatus may be used in place of fin deployment apparatus on projectile .

As seen in and D apparatus may include a base assembly . Base assembly may include a base a spacer a fin mount a gas cavity and an opening . Opening best seen in may extend from a rear end of base to gas cavity . A retention nut may be engaged with base . Retention nut may secure fin mount and spacer to base . A retention plug may be disposed in opening in base assembly .

An obturator groove may be formed in base . A rear side of obturator groove may be defined by spacer . An obturator may be disposed in obturator groove . Obturator may be for example a solid one piece obturator. Assembly of obturator may be easy because obturator may simply slide into groove from the rear of base . Then spacer fin mount and retention nut may be assembled. Complex assembly procedures used with prior art obturators such as a shrink fit or a press fit may not be needed with base assembly .

Retention plug may include at least one gas conduit between an outer surface of retention plug and gas cavity . The gas conduit s in plug may be similar to the conduits of plug except that the conduits in plug may not be formed along the central axis of plug . A retention bolt may extend through retention plug . Retention bolt may be fixed to base .

A plurality of fins hubs may be rotatably fixed to base . Each fin hub may include a yoke . A plurality of fins may be movably connected to respective fin hubs . The number of fins may be for example six. Other numbers of fins may be used. After projectile exits the muzzle of gun tube fins may deploy outwardly into the airstream . In the deployed state fins may be a stabilizing device for projectile .

A retention disk may be disposed in openings in each of fins . Retention disk may be fixed in place by retention bolt . Retention disk may include a plurality of slots formed therein. When fins are in the stowed position a portion of each fin may be disposed in a respective one of slots .

Fin mount may include a fin shaft opening for each fin hub . A fin shaft may be connected to each fin hub . Fin shafts may be rotatably disposed in fin shaft opening in fin mount . Spring loaded pins may be disposed in each fin shaft . The spring loaded pins may be similar to spring loaded pins in . The spring loaded pins may lock each fin hub in the deployed position.

As best seen in and A C each fin may include a slot formed therein. Each fin may be inserted in a yoke of a fin hub . Each fin may be connected to a respective fin hub by fasteners . Fasteners may be movably disposed with respect to slots . Fasteners may be fixed to yokes . Fin hubs and fins may have stowed positions and deployed positions .

Each fin slot may include a central portion that is substantially parallel to longitudinal axis A of projectile when fins are in the stowed position. Each fin slot may include front and rear portions that are substantially perpendicular to central portion . With respect to longitudinal axis A of projectile rear portion of each slot may be radially distant from front portion of each slot .

The number of fasteners that movably connect each fin to each fin hub may be for example two. In the stowed position of fins fastener may be disposed in rear portion of slot and fastener may be disposed in central portion of slot . In the deployed position of fins fastener may be disposed in central portion of slot and fastener may be disposed in front portion of slot .

A spring lever may be disposed in each yoke . Spring lever may have one end fixed to fin hub and a free end . Each fin may include a notch formed on a front surface. Free end of spring lever may be disposed in notch when fin is in the deployed position.

When projectile with fin deployment apparatus is launched gas conduit s in retention plug may allow burning gases into gas cavity . As projectile leaves gun tube a pressure differential occurs such that the pressure exterior to base assembly is close to atmospheric while the pressure in gas cavity is significantly higher. The pressure differential pushes on retention plug and breaks retention bolt . Retention plug retention disk and retention bolt may be pushed rearwardly out of opening as shown in . Then fins may begin their deployment. During deployment fin hubs may rotate forward until fin hubs contact spacer .

At this point fins may tilt or cock forward thereby releasing fins to freely slide through slot . A combination of aerodynamic drag centripetal force and the force of spring levers may contribute to extending fins outward into their deployed locking state while also forcing fin hubs rearward until free ends of spring levers lock in notches in fins . As described with regard to fin deployment apparatus spring loaded pins may lock fin shafts at the desired angle of their deployed state.

The fin subassemblies may support their own inertial set back during launch of projectile while also retaining the ability to extend fins far into the airstream after projectile exits gun tube . The generally s shaped slots in fins enable the inertial support and extension of fins far into the airstream. While projectile is in gun tube fins may not rotate because of the restraint provided by retention disk . Because fins do not rotate with respect to fin hubs fasteners may function as a translational stop in slots and allow fin hubs to pull fins through gun tube . Fin hubs may relieve any inertial loading that fins would exert on retention disk retention plug and retention bolt .

After projectile exits gun tube retention disk may be removed and fins may rotate away from fin hubs . In addition fins may translate outward from fin hubs . Spring levers may assist the translation of fins with respect to fin hubs . As fins translate fully through slots and rotate back to align with fin hubs fasteners may lock into front portions of slots . In addition free ends of spring levers may lock in notches in fins thereby locking fins in the deployed position.

While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
