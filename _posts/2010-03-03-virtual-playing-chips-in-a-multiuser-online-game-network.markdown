The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 158 246 filed Mar. 6 2009 which is incorporated by reference herein for all purposes.

The present disclosure relates to multiuser online games in general and in particular to games that track a store of in game value for players.

Multiuser online games are popular and are well known in the art. In some implementations there is a server that controls aspects of the game such as who can become a player i.e. a user that connects via a client device computer or system to the server the player s sensory inputs player state e.g. what virtual items the player s character possesses what the character has done in the past etc. and player options e.g. what the player or his character can do in the future .

Some multiuser online games are styled as or after casino gambling games e.g. poker roulette slot machines etc. . In a gambling game players generally obtain virtual currency for their character s use in the gambling game. In some gambling games players purchase virtual currency in exchange for legal currency where the legal currency is transferred using a credit debit charge card transaction conveyed over a financial network. In such games the virtual currency might be represented by virtual poker chips or by a number or value stored by the server for that player s benefit. A player would then interact with the game server such that the player or a character controlled by the player plays a gambling game in hopes of increasing the amount of virtual currency the character has so that the player can then cash out and receive from the operator of the gambling game server real world currency corresponding to the gains that player made in the online gambling game.

Aside from the online aspect of this such interactions are similar to a conventional casino transaction wherein a player enters a casino converts real world currency cash check credit card transaction into chips plays gambling games with those chips and cashes in those chips for real world currency. Of course with actual casinos and online casinos activities are regulated by law and banned in certain jurisdictions.

There are online games that have virtual currency that is earned by taking actions in the game. For example a dragon fighting game might reward 10 gold coins each time a dragon is successfully slayed. Some virtual to real economies have developed around the real world sale and purchase of game items. For example where a desired level access right or item in an online game is a reward for many hours of playing the game and someone desires to obtain that without playing the game for hours they might enter into a transaction with someone willing to sell that right. For example a player having virtual goods he wants to sell might list those on an online auction site and then agree to an arrangement with a buyer to have funds transferred from the buyer to the player seller then have the player seller s character in the game hand the items to the buyer s character in the game.

In the case of gambling type games the ability to simply cash out by selling to the game operator would in many jurisdictions constitute regulated and possibly illegal gambling. Furthermore permitting one player to effectively cash out by selling to another player may also run afoul of gambling laws or regulations. Consequently in some cases players want to play gambling style games but without the regulated gambling aspects.

In embodiments of a multiplayer online game system players within the game can acquire virtual currency. Such virtual currency represents units of value for use in the online game system and is analogous to legal currency. Virtual currency can be purchased in one or more actual cash or credit transactions by a player. However the virtual currency cannot be redeemed for legal currency. Consequently the purchase is a one way transaction that provides a benefit to the purchaser only in the context of the virtual environment. Virtual currency can also be earned within the context of the game. For example a player may be rewarded with one or more units of virtual currency after completing a task quest challenge or mission within the game. One advantage of the approached described herein is that virtual currency can be used to purchase virtual items but neither the virtual currency nor the virtual items can be transferred or redeemed in such a way that would be considered gambling proceeds.

Virtual currency can be used in multiplayer online games accessed via social networking servers. For example social games such as Zynga Poker and Farmville offered by Zynga Game Network Inc. of San Francisco Calif. are examples of such games. In order to prevent fraud or other terms of service violations e.g. the exchange of virtual currency for legal currency between players a fraud detection system can be used to block such consummations thereby defeating the market for secret transactions.

In some embodiments non redeemable virtual currency is represented by virtual poker chips. Virtual poker chips are units of value for use in a virtual online multiplayer poker game. Within the context of a multiplayer online poker game virtual poker chips are analogous to real world poker chips. Virtual poker chips can be purchased in one or more actual cash or credit transactions by a player of such virtual poker game as well as acquired from other parties by winning a hand in such virtual poker game or playing other games against other players or between the players characters in the game . Virtual poker chips can be used within the context of the virtual poker game to purchase virtual items. For example a player can buy virtual drinks or other items for one or more other players to support their online social activities. However unlike real world poker chips virtual poker chips are not redeemable for legal currency. Similarly virtual items purchased with virtual poker chips are not redeemable for legal currency.

In some embodiments the virtual poker chips can have a unique game play mechanism. In one example embodiment a first player can make transfers or gifts of virtual poker chips to a second player. However to prevent fraud or other terms of service violations e.g. the transfer of legal currency between players outside the context of the virtual poker game in exchange for the transfer of virtual poker chips within the virtual poker game in game transfers and gifts can be limited. These transfers and gifts can be limited in size e.g. no more than 10 000 chips per transfer and or frequency e.g. no more than one transfer per day . Furthermore transfers can be limited to players who are friends or otherwise connected within the context of an online social network e.g. transfers are only allowed between players who are also friends on Facebook . Fraud detection systems can be used to prevent fraudulent transactions.

In another example embodiment certain levels of purchases of virtual poker chips can correlate to the privilege to play with higher skilled or higher status players not just players with similar amounts of chips. Thus purchased virtual chips and won virtual chips might be treated differently and provide different access to the holder of such virtual chips. This mechanism allows new entrants to the game who are skilled in the real world or alternate online venues to play with players of similar skill without waiting to win multiple games acquire status within the context of the virtual poker game. In another example multiple types of virtual poker chips may be available for purchase from the game operator.

Some embodiments also include the use of virtual poker chips not just in poker but in other online games as well such as blackjack keno and other casino style gambling games.

In some embodiments virtual poker chips can be purchased online. One such embodiment is described in reference to . shows a flowchart illustrating an example method for purchasing virtual currency. illustrates a webpage for accessing a fully operational online poker game according to embodiments of the present disclosure. This online poker game can either be accessed directly or it can be embedded within the webpage of a social networking site. The illustrated page serves as a portal for accessing various features of the online poker game. In various embodiments the website can include a hyperlink for accessing a webpage for purchasing virtual poker chips.

In some embodiments a first player can make transfers or gifts of virtual items to a second player. However to prevent fraud or other terms of service violations e.g. the transfer of legal currency between players outside the context of the virtual poker game in exchange for the transfer of virtual items within the virtual poker game in game transfers and gifts can be limited. These transfers and gifts can be limited in size e.g. no more than one item per transfer and or frequency e.g. no more than one transfer per day . Furthermore transfers can be limited to players who are friends or otherwise connected within the context of an online social network e.g. transfers are only allowed between players who are also friends on Facebook . For example a game server prior to allowing the gift or transfer may access a social network to match the player wishing to gift an in game value e.g. currency virtual objects etc. to another player. Social network platforms support APIs that allow for third party applications to verify connections by providing one or more user identifiers associated with such players. Fraud detection systems can be used to prevent fraudulent transactions.

In some embodiments virtual poker chips can be used to purchase virtual items online. One such embodiment is described in reference to . shows a flowchart illustrating an example method for purchasing virtual items using virtual poker chips. illustrates a webpage of a virtual online poker game with a plurality of players according to embodiments of the present disclosure. This online poker game can be accessed directly or it can be embedded within the webpage of a social networking site. The illustrated page shows a virtual poker table a virtual poker dealer an icon of a first player and icons of a plurality of other players player icons the cards the first player is holding the amount of virtual poker chips held by each player the size of each player s bet and the size of the pot for the current hand of poker. Associated with each player icon is an item icon where one or more virtual items associated with the player can be displayed. The page includes a separate hyperlink or other activatable user interface element for accessing a user interface for purchasing virtual items. In an alternative embodiment the first player can access the user interface for purchasing virtual items by selecting the item icon for any player.

From the page illustrated in a player can select an item to purchase. A player can also select whether to purchase the item for himself or for one or more other players e.g. the player can select to purchase the item for all players at the virtual poker table or for the player s friends who are playing virtual poker at other virtual poker tables . Once the necessary selections are made the player can place the order to purchase the virtual item. This order is received by the server which can then process the order. If the order is processed successfully the player s game account can be debited by the amount of virtual poker chips needed to buy the virtual items selected . In the example illustrated the first player selected to purchase a glass of wine for each player at the table.

In various example embodiments one or more described webpages and functionality discussed above may be associated with a network gaming system or network gaming service.
