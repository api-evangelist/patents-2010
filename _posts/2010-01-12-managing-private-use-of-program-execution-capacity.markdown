title: Managing private use of program execution capacity
abstract: Techniques are described for managing execution of programs, including using excess program execution capacity of one or more computing systems. For example, a private pool of excess computing capacity may be maintained for a user based on unused dedicated program execution capacity allocated for that user, with the private pool of excess capacity being available for priority use by that user. Such private excess capacity pools may further in some embodiments be provided in addition to a general, non-private excess computing capacity pool that is available for use by multiple users, optionally including users who are associated with the private excess capacity pools. In some such situations, excess computing capacity may be made available to execute programs on a temporary basis, such that the programs executing using the excess capacity may be terminated at any time if other preferred use for the excess capacity arises.

Many companies and other organizations operate computer networks that interconnect numerous computing systems to support their operations such as with the computing systems being co located e.g. as part of a local network or instead located in multiple distinct geographical locations e.g. connected via one or more private or public intermediate networks . For example data centers housing significant numbers of interconnected computing systems have become commonplace such as private data centers that are operated by and on behalf of a single organization and public data centers that are operated by entities as businesses to provide computing resources to customers. Some public data center operators provide network access power and secure installation facilities for hardware owned by various customers while other public data center operators provide full service facilities that also include hardware resources made available for use by their customers. However as the scale and scope of typical data centers has increased the task of provisioning administering and managing the physical computing resources has become increasingly complicated.

The advent of virtualization technologies for commodity hardware has provided some benefits with respect to managing large scale computing resources for many customers with diverse needs allowing various computing resources to be efficiently and securely shared by multiple customers. For example virtualization technologies such as those provided by VMWare XEN Linux s KVM Kernel based Virtual Machine or User Mode Linux may allow a single physical computing machine to be shared among multiple users by providing each user with one or more virtual machines hosted by the single physical computing machine with each such virtual machine being a software simulation acting as a distinct logical computing system that provides users with the illusion that they are the sole operators and administrators of a given hardware computing resource while also providing application isolation and security among the various virtual machines.

Techniques are described for managing execution of programs. In at least some embodiments the execution of programs is managed for multiple users using excess computing capacity of one or more computing systems. In particular in at least some such embodiments for each of one or more users a private pool of excess computing capacity is maintained for and associated with that user such as based on currently unused program execution capacity that has been allocated for dedicated use by that associated user and with the private pool of excess computing capacity being available for priority use by the associated user. Such private excess computing capacity pools may further in some embodiments be provided in addition to a general non private excess computing capacity pool that is available for use by multiple users optionally including the one or more users who are associated with the private excess computing capacity pool s . The techniques may in some embodiments be used in conjunction with a program execution service PES that executes multiple programs on behalf of multiple customers or other users of the service such as a program execution service that provides multiple computing nodes e.g. multiple physical computing systems and or virtual machines that are hosted on one or more physical computing systems for executing user programs. In addition in at least some embodiments some or all of the techniques may be automatically performed by embodiments of a Program Execution Service System Manager module as described in greater detail below.

In some embodiments at least some excess or otherwise unused program execution capacity of a PES or other group of computing nodes may be made available to execute programs on behalf of users on a temporary or non guaranteed basis such that the excess program execution capacity may be available to execute such programs until a time that the program execution capacity is desired for other purposes e.g. for preferential or reserved use to execute one or more other programs . Such excess program execution capacity may for example be made available as part of one or more general excess computing capacity pools that are available for use by various users e.g. any customers of a PES that provides the general excess computing capacity pools such as via a spot market with dynamically changing pricing to reflect supply and demand or instead in other manners. In some cases one or more programs may be executing on behalf of a user using excess program execution capacity at the time that the excess program execution capacity is desired for other purposes and in some such cases the execution of those one or more programs may be automatically terminated e.g. shut down aborted etc. by the PES in order to make that excess program execution capacity available for the other purposes. In at least some such embodiments programs that are automatically terminated may be automatically restarted on behalf of the user at a future time such as a future time when a sufficient amount of excess program execution capacity again becomes available to execute the programs for the user. Alternatively rather than terminating the one or more programs that are using excess program execution capacity that is desired for other purposes in some embodiments and situations other program execution capacity may be identified and used in place of the excess program execution capacity that is desired for the other purposes so as to enable the one or more programs using the excess program execution capacity to continue to execute. Additional details related to using excess program execution capacity are included below.

In some embodiments at least some of the program execution capacity available from a PES for executing programs may be allocated to one or more users for preferential use by those users such that each of those users has priority access relative to other users to use a respective amount of the program execution capacity. For example the priority access of the users may be based on each of the users having dedicated or exclusive access to use the respective amount of program execution capacity e.g. each user having one or more dedicated computing nodes and or portions thereof that are allocated for reserved or guaranteed use by the user in executing programs or each user instead having an amount of program execution capacity that is equivalent to one or more computing nodes that is dedicated to the user to be available from a larger group of multiple computing nodes used by multiple users . In at least some such embodiments a respective amount of program execution capacity of a PES may be allocated to a particular user for dedicated access over a specified period of time such as in a manner analogous to a lease of one or more physical computing systems so that the respective amount of program execution capacity may be available for executing programs on behalf of the user throughout the specified period of time. In addition in some embodiments a user may be given preferential or other dedicated access to execute programs based on one or more factors such as fees paid by the user an agreement to a contractual obligation for using the dedicated access for a period of time and or subject to other conditions etc.

In at least some embodiments at least some of the program execution capacity that is allocated to one or more users for dedicated or other preferential use may be used as excess program execution capacity during some times such as when the allocated dedicated capacity is not being used for a preferential use and or when the user to whom the dedicated capacity is allocated makes the allocated dedicated capacity available for use as excess capacity. In this manner at least some program execution capacity that is allocated to a first group of users may become available from time to time to temporarily execute programs on behalf of other users. When the demand for excess program execution capacity from multiple users is greater than the currently available supply particular users and programs may be selected to use the excess program execution capacity in various ways. For example in some embodiments a user who requests excess program execution capacity to execute a program may be given priority over other such users based on one or more factors such as fees offered and or paid by the user a time that a request to use the excess program execution capacity is submitted a time at which or by which excess program execution capacity use is requested to start an amount of time or a deadline by which excess program execution capacity use is requested to be completed a type and or amount of excess program execution capacity requested e.g. a specified quantity of computing nodes etc. Additional details related to the use of dedicated program execution capacity are included below.

In addition as previously noted one or more users may each have an associated private pool of excess computing capacity for which the user has exclusive or priority access in at least some embodiments. For example if a user has dedicated computing capacity of one or more computing nodes but is not currently using some or all of that dedicated capacity the user may be given priority access to use that unused dedicated capacity as a private pool of excess computing capacity in executing programs for the user. In some embodiments such a private pool of excess computing capacity for a user may be established in response to explicit instructions from the user e.g. for a fee from the user while in other embodiments some or all such users that have unused dedicated computing capacity may each automatically receive a private pool of excess computing capacity based on their unused dedicated computing capacity. Furthermore if a user automatically receives a private pool of excess computing capacity using their own unused dedicated computing capacity the user may in some embodiments be unaware of the private pool.

The use of such a private pool of excess computing capacity for a user may provide various benefits to the user in various embodiments and situations. For example in some embodiments the ongoing incremental cost for a user to make use of their dedicated computing capacity may be lower than the cost to the user to make use of a comparable amount of excess computing capacity from a general pool if so the cost to the user for using their own private pool of excess computing capacity may be set at a rate that is less than the cost of the use of the general pool e.g. may be the same cost as the ongoing incremental cost for a user to make use of their dedicated computing capacity may be between the ongoing incremental cost for a user to make use of their dedicated computing capacity and the higher cost of using excess computing capacity from the general pool etc. . In addition in some embodiments a user may receive exclusive or priority access to the excess computing capacity in their own private pool such that the user is able to immediately execute an excess computing capacity request using their private pool even if that same request would not have sufficiently high priority to be immediately executed using a general excess computing capacity pool. Thus use of such a private pool of excess computing capacity for a user to execute a program may provide beneficial program execution characteristics that differ from at least some other program execution characteristics occurring from use of a general excess computing capacity pool to execute the program such as one or more of lower incremental cost of use of a specified amount of program execution capacity for a specified time interval enhanced availability to obtain access to computing capacity from the private pool relative to the general pool enhanced ability to continue execution of the program using computing capacity from the private pool relative to the general pool etc.

As one specific example of use of a private excess computing capacity pool a first user may initiate dedicated use of multiple computing nodes for a particular purpose but maintain a portion of those multiple computing nodes in reserve e.g. to reserve 20 of the total multiple computing nodes as backup for possible later use such as to be able to automatically scale the computing nodes being used for the particular purpose in response to higher than expected computing load and or to be able to replace any computing nodes being used for the particular purpose if they become unavailable in such situations the computing nodes that are in reserve may be used as a first private pool of excess computing capacity for the first user while they are not being used for the particular purpose but with those computing nodes that are in reserve being available to the first user for the particular purpose if they are later desired. As another specific example of use of a private excess computing capacity pool a second user may initiate dedicated use of multiple computing nodes but with all of the multiple computing nodes intended for use by the second user as a second private pool of excess computing capacity for the second user the second private pool of excess computing capacity may then be used to fulfill requests from multiple entities associated with the second user e.g. if the second user represents an organization and the multiple entities are different groups or people within the organization with the multiple entities being third parties to which the second user sells access to the second private pool of excess computing capacity etc. such as in a manner similar to the techniques described herein for managing multiple requests from multiple users to use a general excess computing capacity pool. Furthermore if the second private pool of excess computing capacity for the second user is used to fulfill requests from multiple entities the management of those requests and that second private pool may in some embodiments be performed by a third party operator of a PES and or a Program Execution Service System Manager PESSM module e.g. for a fee charged to the second user while in other embodiments the second user may obtain and use a PESSM module or otherwise be enabled to perform such actions on their own behalf. Moreover in some embodiments some or all of the dedicated capacity computing nodes that are used for a user may be provided by or otherwise managed by that user such as for example if the first and or second users noted above provide at least some of the computing nodes used for the first and second excess computing capacity pools respectively.

If a user has a private pool of excess computing capacity and there is a separate general pool of excess computing capacity that is also available the different excess computing capacity pools may be used in various manners. For example if such a user makes a request to use excess computing capacity the request may first be satisfied using that user s private pool if it has sufficient computing capacity for the request and otherwise the request may be considered for satisfaction by the general excess computing capacity pool along with requests from other users. Similarly if one or more first programs are being executed for such a user by using the user s private pool of excess computing capacity and that excess computing capacity is desired by the user for other purposes e.g. to execute one or more other second programs for the user as part of the user s dedicated computing capacity the execution of the one or more first programs may in some embodiments automatically be moved to the general excess computing capacity pool e.g. by continuing execution of the first programs without termination such as by identifying and using other available computing capacity to serve as a replacement part of the user s dedicated computing capacity by terminating execution of the first programs on one or more computing nodes that are part of the user s dedicated computing capacity and initiating further execution of the first programs in an immediate or rapid manner using other computing nodes that are part of the general pool of excess computing capacity by terminating execution of the first programs on one or more computing nodes that are part of the user s dedicated computing capacity and placing a request for further execution of the first programs in a request queue along with other requests for use of the general excess computing capacity pool etc. . Additional details related to the use of private excess computing capacity pools are included below.

In addition to the types of dedicated and excess computing capacity capabilities that are discussed above a PES may further include on demand variable program execution capacity that is available to satisfy at least some dynamically received requests of users to execute programs e.g. immediately upon request of those users at an indicated future time at some time during an indicated future time period etc. in some embodiments such that the one or more programs indicated by such a request may be executed if computing resources sufficient to satisfy the requested execution are available at or near the requested time but without such a request being guaranteed to be satisfied i.e. without sufficient computing resources being guaranteed to be available . For example after an on demand variable program execution capacity request is received to dynamically execute one or more programs on behalf of a user e.g. for immediate execution the one or more programs may be executed for the user if an appropriate amount of on demand program execution capacity is currently available for executing those programs e.g. if it is determined that there is a sufficient number of available computing nodes with resources to satisfy the request and otherwise the request may be denied or in some cases postponed . Thus in some such embodiments such a request for on demand variable program execution capacity may be unsuccessful such as if the appropriate amount of program execution capacity is not available to execute the one or more programs at the time of the requested execution e.g. if it is determined that there are not enough currently available computing nodes with sufficient resources to satisfy a request for immediate execution .

In some embodiments the computing nodes used to provide the on demand variable program execution capacity may be distinct from the computing nodes used to provide dedicated program execution capacity and or from the computing nodes used to provide excess program execution capacity thus if some of the computing nodes used to provide the on demand variable program execution capacity are not in use in some embodiments they may be used to provide excess program execution capacity until on demand variable program execution capacity requests are received while in other embodiments they may not be used to provide such excess program execution capacity. In addition in some embodiments after an on demand variable program execution capacity request for immediate or scheduled execution is satisfied and successfully initiates execution of one or more programs on behalf of a respective user the ongoing use of the on demand variable program execution capacity may be guaranteed to continue until some future time such as a time of the respective user s choosing e.g. based on an indication received from the respective user to terminate use of and or release the program execution capacity and or a time based upon design by the user e.g. the one or more programs executing on behalf of the user automatically terminate the execution such as upon completion of a task or otherwise an application and or other user interacting with the one or more programs executing on behalf of the respective user terminates the execution such as if the one or more programs executing for the respective user are provided for interactive use of others etc. . Alternatively in some embodiments the guaranteed ongoing use of the variable program execution capacity may be subject to certain limitations such as to be guaranteed that the PES will not preempt the use for other purposes but not to be guaranteed against failure of the computing nodes executing the programs.

In addition as previously noted dedicated program execution capacity functionality of a PES may be available for one or more users in at least some embodiments such that each of the one or more users may have some dedicated amount of program execution capacity that is allocated by the PES and guaranteed to be available for executing programs on behalf of the one or more users e.g. a dedicated number of one or more computing nodes provided by the PES a dedicated portion of the computing resources provided by a group of one or more of the computing nodes of the PES etc. . For example the guaranteed availability of the dedicated program execution capacity may be provided in conjunction with one or more QoS Quality Of Service criteria such as that the dedicated program execution capacity will be available within a specified period of time after a request to initiate execution of an indicated program e.g. a period of time that corresponds to terminating execution of other programs using excess computing capacity and to initiating execution of the indicated program . In contrast to the on demand variable program execution capacity functionality and the excess program execution capacity functionality a user of dedicated capacity functionality may have some specified amount of program execution capacity that is guaranteed to be available for executing programs on behalf of the user during a specified use period barring unforeseen and or occasional events rendering services of the PES unavailable e.g. service failure maintenance etc .

Furthermore in embodiments in which a PES provides two or more of dedicated computing capacity excess computing capacity and on demand variable computing capacity to users for fees the fees associated with the different types of computing capacity may differ in various manners such as to reflect associated availability guarantees and or other factors. As one example the overall cost for a user to make use of a particular amount of dedicated computing capacity may be higher than the cost to the user to make use of a comparable amount of on demand variable computing capacity if available and that cost to the user to use the on demand variable computing capacity may be higher than the cost to the user to make use of a comparable amount of excess computing capacity if available from a general pool in some cases however the cost of using dedicated computing capacity may include a one time or periodic fee that is not based on actual use and a separate ongoing incremental cost for a user to make use of a particular amount of dedicated computing capacity for a particular amount of time with that ongoing incremental cost for a particular amount of dedicated computing capacity use optionally being less than the cost for using a comparable amount of general excess computing capacity pool for that period of time. Furthermore as noted above costs for using a private excess computing capacity pool may differ from those of using a general excess computing capacity pool such as to in some embodiments be the same as the ongoing incremental cost for dedicated computing capacity use. Additional details related to pricing and costs are included below.

In the example of a number of users are interacting over a network with an illustrated embodiment of a Program Execution Service System Manager module to execute programs on one or more computing nodes available for executing programs of the users with the PESSM module providing some or all of the functionality of a particular program execution service not shown . In particular in the illustrated embodiment the PESSM module and the computing nodes are provided by a program execution service provider as part of a provided program execution service and the PESSM module may execute on one or more computing systems not shown . In this example the program execution service provides a variety of functionality for managing execution of programs on the computing nodes for various users.

Various remote users and may interact over the network with the PESSM in this example to configure and or request various types of execution of programs on behalf of the users. In this example the remote users include one or more dedicated capacity users one or more excess capacity users one or more on demand variable capacity users and optionally one or more other users as discussed below. The network may for example be a publicly accessible network of linked networks possibly operated by various distinct parties such as the Internet. In other embodiments the network may be a private network such as for example a corporate or university network that is wholly or partially inaccessible to non privileged users. In still other embodiments the network may include one or more private networks with access to and or from the Internet.

The illustrated computing nodes are provided for use in executing programs on behalf of the users and in some embodiments may include multiple physical computing systems and or multiple virtual machines that are hosted on one or more physical computing systems as is described in greater detail with respect to . Each of the computing nodes has some amount of computing resources available for executing one or more programs and provides a specific amount of program execution capacity such as may be measured for example by a combination of one or more of processing capacity e.g. number and or size of processing units memory capacity storage capacity network bandwidth capacity etc. In some embodiments the PES provider may provide preconfigured computing nodes with each preconfigured computing node having similar and or equivalent amounts of resources available for executing programs on behalf of users while in other embodiments the PES provider may provide a selection of various different computing nodes from which a user may choose for executing programs on behalf of the user such as each selection having varying amounts and or types of computing related resources e.g. size speed and or type of processing units number of processing units amount of memory and or storage platform configuration such as 32 bit or 64 bit etc. .

In some embodiments the various users and may interact with the PESSM to specify preferred and or required resources for execution of programs on behalf of the users e.g. by specifying one or more computing nodes etc. . In various embodiments such resources may be specified at the time of a request for execution of programs on behalf of a user and or at one or more other times such as when a user registers and or subscribes to use services of the program execution service. In some embodiments the PESSM may provide subscription and or registration services to one or more users such that users may specify information related to one or more programs to execute on behalf of a user e.g. programs source code addressable locations of one or more programs etc. account information e.g. user name billing information etc. terms of use etc. In addition after a user interacts with the PESSM to subscribe and or register for services the user may in some embodiments be issued one or more identifiers e.g. keys tokens user names certificates etc. that are associated with the user and are used in conjunction with executing programs on behalf of the user. In other embodiments a module other than the PESSM may be provided to perform various operations related to subscription and or registration services of a PES.

In the illustrated embodiment one or more variable capacity users are interacting with the PESSM to configure and or request execution of one or more programs using on demand variable program execution capacity such as by submitting a request for immediate execution and or providing information for later execution. After a request for immediate execution is received the PESSM may determine whether there are a sufficient number of computing nodes with available resources for satisfying the request and if so the PESSM may initiate execution of one or more programs for the request on an appropriate amount of the computing nodes on behalf of the user. In cases where a user schedules a request for one or more future executions of one or more programs the PESSM may attempt to reserve an appropriate amount of computing nodes for executing the one or more programs at the one or more future times and or may delay the determination of which computing nodes to use for execution until a later time e.g. such as when the one or more future times occur . In the illustrated embodiment if the PESSM is unable to allocate computing nodes for executing a variable capacity user request the request may fail such that the programs are not executed. In such cases the user may resubmit a failed request for later execution. As previously noted in some embodiments a variable capacity user may be charged various fees in association with use of the PES such as based on a number of computing nodes used a type of computing nodes used a duration of time the computing nodes are used etc. In addition while not illustrated here some portion of the computing nodes may in some embodiments be specified to provide the on demand variable program execution capacity while in other embodiments the on demand variable program execution capacity may be provided in other manners e.g. using all of the computing nodes using all of the computing nodes that are not allocated for another purpose such as for dedicated capacity etc. .

In addition in this example a subset of the computing nodes has been allocated for use by one or more of the dedicated capacity users such that each of the one or more dedicated capacity users may have priority access to execute programs for the user on at least some portion of those allocated computing nodes. For example in some embodiments each of the dedicated capacity users may have one or more computing nodes dedicated for executing programs of that user during a specified use time period such that the user may access the one or more computing nodes at any time during the specified use period to execute programs on behalf of the user and or may continuously execute programs on the one or more computing nodes for the duration of the specified period. As one specific example one or more of the dedicated capacity users may enter into a long term e.g. 1 year term agreement with the PES provider such that each of those users has priority access to a dedicated amount of the computing nodes over the term of the agreement in exchange for a fixed fee payment e.g. upfront or periodically billed and in some cases other use fees e.g. variable fees associated with use of various resources such as electricity physical rack space network utilization etc. .

After a dedicated capacity user interacts with the PESSM to request priority use of a dedicated amount of computing nodes the PESSM may allocate one or more computing nodes from the computing nodes for dedicated use by the user. For example in some embodiments one or more specific computing nodes of the multiple computing nodes e.g. one or more specific physical computing nodes and or virtual computing nodes may be allocated for priority use by an associated specific dedicated capacity user for an entire use period e.g. such as by allocating the specific computing nodes at the time of registration and or at one or more other times such that requests to execute programs on behalf of the specific dedicated user on dedicated computing nodes during the use period results in initiation of execution of the programs on the specific one or more allocated computing nodes. In other embodiments rather than allocate specific computing nodes to specific dedicated users for an entire use period the PESSM may instead allocate computing nodes from a dedicated computing node group having multiple computing nodes such that an appropriate amount of computing nodes with sufficient resources to satisfy requests for execution by the various dedicated capacity users may be available in the dedicated computing node group. In some such embodiments after a request is received to execute one or more programs for a dedicated user on one or more dedicated computing nodes an appropriate amount of computing nodes sufficient to execute the programs may be selected from the dedicated computing node group at the time of the request to execute the one or more programs. After the selected amount of computing nodes are no longer used for executing the request for the dedicated user e.g. after termination and or completion of the requested execution those computing nodes may be returned to the dedicated computing node group for use by other dedicated capacity users and in some embodiments may further be tracked as being available for use as part of a private pool of excess computing capacity for that dedicated user as discussed below. In addition after a use period for a particular dedicated capacity user expires the one or more computing nodes allocated for use by that user may similarly be released for use by others such as by for example making the computing nodes available to be allocated for use by one or more other e.g. new dedicated capacity users. In addition the PESSM may perform one or more various other management operations with respect to fulfilling requests for execution such as for example enforcing use periods and or other restrictions associated with requests and or users submitting requests freeing up computing resources to fulfill the requests authorizing and or authenticating the requests and or the requesting users etc. In some embodiments a delay may be incurred between a time that a request for execution on dedicated program execution capacity and a time that the request is fulfilled such as a delay period for performing various of the management operations etc. In various other embodiments computing nodes for dedicated capacity users may be allocated tracked reserved and or released using various other techniques.

In addition in the illustrated embodiment multiple excess capacity users are interacting with the PESSM to configure and or request execution of one or more programs using excess program execution capacity of the PES such excess capacity users may include users who use private excess capacity pools and or one or more general excess capacity pools. As previously noted excess program execution capacity may include excess and or unused program execution capacity that may be otherwise allocated for other uses and in some embodiments may be separated into at least one general excess capacity pool that includes the excess computing capacity that is not in use as part of one or more other private excess capacity pools. For example in the illustrated embodiment excess program execution capacity may include a number of the computing nodes that are otherwise allocated for other purposes e.g. for use by dedicated capacity users variable capacity users and or other users but are not currently being used for those purposes. The excess capacity users may configure requests for execution of programs in various ways in various embodiments such as by specifying a number and or type of computing nodes for execution of programs a minimum and or maximum number of computing nodes to use an expiration time for the request a preferred execution time and or period of execution one or more bids for payment of use of excess program execution capacity e.g. a bid per each use of a computing node a bid per use of one or more computing nodes per some unit of time a minimum and or maximum bid etc etc.

As is further discussed with respect to the illustrated embodiment of the PESSM may determine when to include and or remove one or more computing nodes from excess program execution capacity that is available for use by excess capacity users when to initiate and or terminate requested execution of programs for excess capacity users and on which of the computing nodes available for use by excess capacity users to execute the programs. In addition the PESSM may further track how much excess capacity is available for each of one or more excess capacity users in private excess capacity pools for those users such as for some or all excess capacity users that are also dedicated capacity users . In various embodiments the PESSM may determine that one or more computing nodes are unused and or or otherwise available for use by excess capacity users in various ways. For example in some embodiments the PESSM may receive indications from various users and or entities that one or more computing nodes are not being used or are otherwise available for use by excess capacity users such as indications from one or more dedicated capacity users that they are not using some number and or portion of the computing nodes dedicated for use by those users. In some such embodiments such dedicated capacity users may indicate one or more times at which dedicated computing nodes are likely to be or are committed by the dedicated capacity users to be unused and or available e.g. particular times of day particular days periods of time etc. . In addition in some embodiments one or more other users may interact in similar manners to indicate that one or more computing nodes such as one or more computing nodes under the control of the one or more other users e.g. third party computing systems not shown are available for use by excess capacity users.

In other embodiments the PESSM may automatically determine when computing nodes are available for excess capacity users such as for example by monitoring some or all computing nodes to determine when the computing nodes are not being used and or by tracking usage patterns of one or more users of such computing nodes e.g. dedicated capacity users variable capacity users other users etc. . In some such cases determining whether computing nodes are unused or otherwise underutilized may include determining and or predicting a likelihood that the computing nodes will remain unused for at least a period of time sufficient to execute programs of one or more excess capacity users such as for example based on an analysis of past use patterns of the computing nodes by one or more users. In various embodiments a period of time sufficient to execute programs of one or more excess capacity users may be based on one or more considerations such as a time to stop start programs on behalf of users a time to configure computing nodes for use a type of program executed on behalf of an excess capacity user e.g. some types of programs may perform useful amounts of work in short periods of time such as various types of data processing etc. while other programs use longer periods of time before useful results are produced etc.

After it is determined that one or more computing nodes are available for use by one or more excess capacity users such computing nodes may be added to a general pool of available excess program execution capacity and or otherwise tracked as being part of one or more private excess capacity pools such that the one or more computing nodes may be used by the PESSM for executing programs on behalf of corresponding excess capacity users until such time that other uses of the computing nodes arise e.g. such as priority usage by dedicated capacity users variable computing users and or one or more other users or entities . The PESSM may further determine that one or more of the excess capacity computing nodes are no longer available for use by excess capacity users in various ways in various embodiments. For example in some embodiments the PESSM may receive indications that one or more computing nodes are no longer available such as based on explicit requests to stop use of the computing nodes from a user that controls those computing nodes requests to execute programs of priority users on the one or more computing nodes an expiration of a specified period of availability etc. As another example in some embodiments the PESSM may automatically determine other uses for the computing nodes such as for example based on received requests from one or more users that correspond to the other uses or based on determining a likely demand for one or more computing nodes e.g. based on detecting an increased usage of other resources and or programs for which the computing nodes may be used etc. .

In some embodiments an excess capacity user may interact with the PESSM to request immediate execution of one or more programs on a specified number of excess computing nodes and or to schedule such execution at one or more future times such that the PESSM may initiate the requested execution on the specified number of excess computing nodes if it is determined that the specified number of excess computing nodes are available at the time of the requested execution. The determination of whether the specified number of excess computing nodes are available at the time may include first considering whether a private excess capacity pool if any for the user includes the specified number of excess computing nodes and selecting those excess computing nodes for use if they are available. If only a subset of the specified number of excess computing nodes are available in a private excess capacity pool for the user the PESSM may in some embodiments select those private excess computing nodes to use in partially fulfilling the request and attempt to obtain the remaining excess computing nodes from the general excess capacity pool or instead may proceed in other manners e.g. fulfilling the request using only the subset of available private excess computing nodes indicating that the request fails because the private excess capacity pool does not include all of the specified number of excess computing nodes attempting to fulfill the request using only excess computing nodes from the general excess capacity pool etc. . In addition in some embodiments an excess capacity user may interact with the PESSM to configure a request for execution of one or more programs on a specified number of excess computing nodes to be performed as such excess computing nodes become available to execute the one or more programs such as during an indicated future period of time and in some such embodiments the PESSM may initiate the requested execution on the specified number of excess computing nodes when it determines that the specified number of excess computing nodes are available during that period of time. In some embodiments an excess capacity user may specify a minimum and or maximum number of excess computing nodes to use for performing a requested execution such that the requested execution is initiated if the PESSM determines that at least the minimum number of excess computing nodes are available whether from a private excess capacity pool and or a general excess capacity pool and the PESSM may initiate the requested execution on up to the maximum if specified number of excess computing nodes for the request based on availability of the excess computing nodes.

After a request for execution of one or more programs on behalf of an excess capacity user is received if the PESSM determines that there are an appropriate number of computing nodes with sufficient computing resources to satisfy the requested execution whether from a private excess capacity pool and or a general excess capacity pool the PESSM may select which of the available computing nodes to use for the requested execution in various ways. For example in some embodiments the PESSM may simply select an appropriate number of excess computing nodes from any of the available computing nodes with sufficient resources such as for example by randomly selecting from a pool of available computing nodes. In other embodiments one or more specific computing nodes may be selected on the basis of one or more other factors such as for example a predicted length of and or likelihood of continued availability of the one or more specific computing nodes a physical proximity of the one or more specific computing nodes to one or more other computing nodes a geographic location of the one or more specific computing nodes and or one or more other computing nodes etc. Furthermore if one or more particular computing nodes have been dedicated for use by a particular user those particular computing nodes may be the only ones used as part of a private excess capacity pool for that particular user.

As previously noted execution of programs for excess capacity users on excess computing nodes may be temporary such that the PESSM may automatically terminate such programs when other preferred uses for the excess computing nodes arise e.g. such as if the excess computing nodes are reclaimed by a dedicated capacity user who previously was not using a decided computing node etc. . In such cases if programs are currently executing on behalf of excess capacity users on any of those excess computing nodes then those programs may be automatically terminated e.g. aborted shut down hibernated etc. such that the computing nodes are free for other purposes and no longer available for excess capacity users. In addition as discussed in greater detail elsewhere in some embodiments the execution state of those programs may be saved before they are terminated such as to enable a later restart of the program. Furthermore in some such embodiments there may be multiple excess computing nodes currently executing programs on behalf of excess capacity users that may be capable of satisfying the number of computing nodes for the other purposes and in such cases the PESSM may determine which of the excess computing nodes to free for the other purposes based on various factors e.g. by first reclaiming excess capacity computing nodes from a private excess capacity pool of a user for use in fulfilling a request from that user for dedicated capacity use or by using a determined priority among the current requests of the excess capacity users such as based on time submitted bid prices etc. . In some embodiments at least some of the terminated programs may have their execution be migrated and or reinitiated on one or more other available excess computing nodes if any such as immediately or at a later time. In some such cases if there are not enough excess computing nodes available to satisfy all of the current excess capacity users who are executing programs or requesting execution of programs then the PESSM may determine to terminate one or more additional programs executing on one or more other excess computing nodes such that the one or more programs initially terminated that were executing on the specific computing nodes may be reinitiated on the newly freed excess computing nodes e.g. based on a determined priority of the excess capacity users such that the requests associated with the one or more initially terminated programs that were executing on the specific computing nodes have higher priority than at least some of the requests associated with the one or more additional programs . In some embodiments after the PESSM automatically terminates a program of a user the PESSM may automatically reinitiate the execution of the programs as excess computing nodes become available to execute the programs for the user. In addition in other embodiments at least some terminated programs of a user may be automatically migrated and or reinitiated on one or more other computing systems and or program execution services with sufficient computing resources available to execute the programs including one or more computing nodes available via variable capacity functionality provided to variable capacity users dedicated capacity functionality provided to dedicated capacity users and or one or more third party computing systems not shown external to the PES.

In addition various types of programs may be better suited for executing in such a temporary execution environment as provided by excess capacity pools such as programs that are relatively tolerant of unexpected interruptions due to occasional termination. In some embodiments excess capacity users may execute one or more programs on the excess program execution capacity that are designed to intermittently track and or save progress e.g. intermediate results current runtime state etc. so that the programs may be reinitiated at a future time to resume activities. In addition in some embodiments when the PESSM automatically terminates programs executing on excess computing nodes the PESSM may automatically detect the current system and or program execution state such that the detected state may be saved and or provided to a respective excess capacity user so that later execution of the programs may be resumed in a state similar to when the programs were automatically terminated. Alternatively if a particular executing program is able to save its own execution state the PESSM may instead notify the program to perform its own execution state save before terminating the program. Additional details related to example embodiments of saving program execution state are included in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 334 004 filed Dec. 12 2008 and entitled Saving Program Execution State which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

As previously noted in at least some embodiments a user having a private excess capacity pool receives priority access to any program execution capacity in that private excess capacity pool e.g. so as to execute any excess capacity requests from the user before any excess capacity requests from any others but if such a private excess capacity pool includes excess capacity that is not currently in use by the associated user for the private pool that currently available excess capacity may be made temporarily available via a general excess capacity pool to other users. In addition access to excess computing nodes from a general excess capacity pool for executing programs on behalf of multiple excess capacity users may be based on priority among the excess capacity users in at least some embodiments such that if there is contention for some amount of the excess computing nodes between two or more requests to execute programs the request having a higher associated priority will be provided access to use the contended amount of excess computing nodes for executing programs. In at least one illustrative embodiment requests with the highest bid amounts e.g. a highest maximum bid may be given priority over requests with lower bids with ties between bid amounts being resolved based on other factors e.g. which request was received earlier . In some embodiments one or more of the excess capacity users may interact with an embodiment of the PESSM to bid e.g. auction style on access to one or more available excess computing nodes e.g. currently available and or available at one or more future times of the general excess capacity pool such that the user with the winning bid may receive the access to the one or more available excess computing nodes. In some embodiments the PESSM may automatically terminate execution of programs associated with lower priority requests that are currently executing on one or more of the excess computing nodes in favor of executing programs of higher priority requests on the one or more excess computing nodes. In some other embodiments such as non priority based embodiments the PESSM may instead occasionally rotate through pending requests to execute programs on excess computing nodes such that each request may be provided some amount of execution time on one or more of the excess computing nodes.

In some embodiments the PESSM may provide interactive feedback to one or more of the excess capacity users that are interacting with the PESSM to configure and or request execution of programs on some amount of excess computing nodes of a general excess capacity pool. For example in some such embodiments interactive feedback may include indications of when and or for how long requested programs may be likely to execute on the indicated amount of excess computing nodes such as based on current and or predicted demand current and or likely amounts of excess computing nodes one or more bid levels etc. In one illustrative embodiment the PESSM may indicate suggested bid levels along with corresponding information indicating when requested execution will likely occur and or complete such that the excess capacity user may reconfigure e.g. by specifying a different bid a different amount and or type of computing nodes a different duration of execution etc. a request to meet the desires of the excess capacity user such that the request may be performed at an earlier time etc.

As previously noted excess capacity users may be charged various fees in conjunction with use of excess program execution capacity such as based on whether the excess program execution capacity being used for a user is part of a private excess capacity pool for that user based on a quantity of computing nodes used and or one or more use factors e.g. number of times used amount of shared resources consumed amount of time computing nodes are used etc. and or based on one or more bids from the one or more excess capacity users for use of the computing nodes. In some embodiments a portion of the fees charged to the one or more excess capacity users who use a general excess computing capacity pool may be supplied to one or more other users who provided computing nodes in that general excess capacity pool e.g. one or more dedicated capacity users one or more other users etc. . For example in some embodiments such other users may be paid a proportional share of some amount of the fees that are collected from excess capacity users such as a proportional share reflective of the amount of computing nodes contributed by the other users over time. In some cases such fees supplied to the other users may be automatically credited and or paid to the other users by the PES provider such as to offset other charges incurred by those other users such as charges incurred by dedicated capacity users.

In addition in some embodiments the PESSM may provide an electronic marketplace not shown to one or more dedicated capacity users such that the one or more dedicated capacity users may transfer access to their dedicated computing nodes to one or more other users during the use time period of the dedicated capacity while in other embodiments a dedicated capacity user and an other user may arrange an exchange in a manner external to the PES. In some embodiments a user may provide payment to a dedicated capacity user in exchange for access to a transferred portion of the dedicated capacity user s dedicated computing nodes such that the purchasing user may access the transferred portions of dedicated program execution capacity to execute programs on behalf of the purchasing user. A price for the exchanged access may be determined in various manners in various embodiments such as via a fixed price specified by the dedicated capacity user a price that is bid or suggested by the user etc. In some embodiments an exchange for dedicated computing nodes may be made such that the exchange is temporary and or permanent. For example in some embodiments an exchange may be made for a specified limited period of time and or various intervals of time such that the purchasing user may access the computing nodes during that specified time and or during the various intervals after which the dedicated computing nodes may revert back to the dedicated capacity user for use by the dedicated capacity user. In other embodiments the exchange may be permanent such that the purchasing user may be provided with access to the dedicated computing nodes for any remaining use period associated with the dedicated computing nodes. In some embodiments as part of the initial allocation of one or more computing nodes for dedicated use by a subscribing dedicated capacity user the PESSM may assign one or more user tokens to the subscribing user and or may otherwise associate the allocated computing nodes with the subscribing dedicated capacity user s account such that the dedicated capacity user s use of the computing nodes may be tracked for various purposes e.g. configuration authorization billing etc. in such embodiments when a dedicated capacity user transfers a portion of their dedicated computing nodes to a new user any provided tokens may be transferred to the new user and or the portion of computing nodes may be otherwise associated with an account of the new user. In some embodiments a provider of the PESSM may further collect a fee in conjunction with a transfer of a portion of dedicated computing nodes from one user to another.

Although the foregoing example embodiment of is described with respect to a PES that provides various types of functionality for various types of users such as variable capacity users dedicated capacity users and excess capacity users it will be appreciated that various other embodiments may exist such as embodiments with or without one or more of the various types of users.

For example it will be appreciated that some embodiments may exist where a program execution service provides functionality for excess capacity users but does not include variable and or dedicated capacity users such as where the excess program execution capacity is provided by one or more third parties and or affiliate entities associated with the PES such as to allow such parties and or entities to monetize otherwise unused computing resources. In addition some of the techniques may be used in conjunction with a bid based PES that allows users to submit requests for and or to schedule execution of programs on a temporary basis on all of the program execution capacity provided by the service such that requests with higher priority at the time of execution are executed. In addition it will be appreciated that the various users and may each act as one or more of the other various users at times such as when those users are accessing associated functionality of the types corresponding to those other various users including for dedicated capacity users to at times act as excess capacity users and use private excess capacity pools based on those users unused dedicated capacity. As another example in some embodiments a particular user who acts as a dedicated capacity user to execute programs on dedicated program execution capacity may also act as an on demand variable capacity user such as when the particular user desires additional computing resources to execute one or more programs for the respective user etc.

In addition in at least some additional embodiments unused portions of a single one of the computing nodes e.g. unused processing unit clock cycles unused portions of memory etc. may be made available for use by one or more excess capacity users such that one or more programs of the one or more excess capacity users may be sharing resources of a single computing node with a dedicated capacity user and or other excess capacity users . In addition in some embodiments at least some of the computing nodes that are allocated for use by dedicated capacity users may be made available for use by one or more variable capacity users such as if it is determined that such access is unlikely to impact dedicated capacity users e.g. in cases where accurate predictions of upcoming demand can be forecast etc. . Furthermore in some embodiments if some amount of computing nodes dedicated for use by one or more dedicated capacity users is oversubscribed e.g. oversold and or provided to one or more other long term users such that the oversubscribed computing nodes are unavailable for the one or more dedicated capacity users at a time that those users request use of them then one or more of the programs executing on the oversubscribed computing nodes may be migrated to one or more other computing nodes such as one or more other computing nodes available in one or more remote data centers and or other computing systems available for executing the one or more programs such as computing systems provided by another program execution service etc.

In addition although some embodiments are described with respect to a program execution service and program execution capacity it will be appreciated that the described techniques may be used to manage access to various other groups of computing nodes or other types of computing related resources. A non exclusive list of examples of other types of computing related resources that may be managed for use by multiple users may include the following persistent data storage capabilities e.g. on non volatile memory devices such as hard disk drives temporary data storage capabilities e.g. on volatile memory such as RAM message queuing and or passing capabilities other types of communication capabilities e.g. network sockets virtual communication circuits etc. database management capabilities dedicated bandwidth or other network related resources input device capabilities output device capabilities processor e.g. CPU cycles or other instruction execution capabilities etc. For example a user may request one or more indicated types of computing related resources to use and the PESSM module may automatically determine an amount of each indicated type of resource e.g. based on an explicit quantity or other amount indicated by the user in the request based on predetermined amounts associated with particular resource types based on available amounts of the indicated resource types etc. to provide for the user such as a first amount of volatile memory and a second amount of persistent storage.

The example data center includes a number of physical host computing systems physical computing systems and the PESSM module of the PES. In this example host computing systems each provides multiple virtual machines and has a virtual machine VM manager component to manage those virtual machines e.g. a hypervisor or other virtual machine monitor and some or all of the computing systems may similarly have one or more such virtual machines and or VM Manager components not shown . Alternatively in other embodiments some or all of the physical host computing systems at the data center may not provide any virtual machines such as to instead directly execute one or more programs on behalf of end user customers of the PES. Furthermore in some embodiments various of the computing systems and may have differing capabilities may have different associated fees for use may support different types of user programs e.g. virtual machine software image instances of different sizes or programs with different types of resource criteria and or computing resource usage such as differing patterns of I O and memory access and network usage etc. If so particular users and or their programs may be grouped e.g. automatically according to one or more such factors which may further be used as constraints and or preferences regarding which computing systems to select for executing particular programs. The example data center further includes an internal network that may include multiple networking devices not shown such as switches edge routers and core routers with computing systems and and one or more computing systems not shown that execute the PESSM module being connected to the internal network .

The illustrated PESSM module performs at least some of the described techniques in order to manage execution of programs using the computing systems and as described in greater detail elsewhere. When a particular computing node or system is selected to execute one or more programs of a user the PESSM module may in some embodiments initiate execution of those programs by interacting with a VM manager component or other manager component that controls execution of programs for that selected computing node system or may alternatively directly execute the programs on the selected computing node system. Users of the PES may use various computing systems to interact with the PESSM module such as computing systems or or computing systems at one of the other data centers .

It will be appreciated that the data center of is provided for illustrative purposes only and that program execution services and other software execution services may be provided in other manners in other embodiments. For example PESSM module may instead be provided using one or more other computing systems external to the data center such as computing systems or at a data center . In other embodiments a PES may be provided without using any data centers.

With respect to table illustrates information about usage of a number of computing nodes of a program execution service by various users of the program execution service over time with use of each computing node being illustrated at consecutive time intervals . In addition table illustrates information about example requests A B C and D received by the program execution service to execute programs on behalf of users using excess computing nodes of a general excess computing capacity pool of the program execution service. In the illustrated table shading is used as follows a time interval having a solid gray background e.g. time interval of dedicated computing node and time interval of other computing node indicates that the respective computing node is not available to be used for excess program execution capacity during that respective interval of time e.g. it is being used for one or more other purposes and or is otherwise not available a time interval having a solid white background e.g. time intervals and of dedicated computing node or having a diagonal lined background e.g. time interval of dedicated computing node and time interval of other computing node indicates that the respective computing node is available for use as excess program execution capacity during that respective interval of time and a time interval containing a letter A B C or D e.g. time intervals of dedicated computing node indicates that programs of the respective request for excess program execution capacity are executing on the respective computing node during that time interval. As one illustrative example each time interval may correspond to an hour or instead to other time intervals e.g. a day 10 minutes etc. .

As previously noted table illustrates various requests received by the program execution service at various indicated times such that each of the various requests is to execute one or more programs on a specified amount of excess computing nodes available from the program execution service using computing nodes . In addition each of the requests has various specified configuration information in this example including a specified minimum and maximum number of computing nodes on which to execute the one or more programs of the request a bid fee amount that the user is willing to pay for execution of the one or more programs on each of the computing nodes e.g. such as a dollar amount per use hour of a single computing node and an indication of a time at which the request is to expire e.g. such as a specified total duration of execution time after which a request is to expire a specified time at which a request is to expire etc. . As one illustrative example request A was received at a time that approximately corresponds to time interval e.g. just before time interval or during time interval with a minimum and maximum number of computing nodes both indicating a preference to execute on a single excess capacity computing node with a bid price of 0.05 per hour of use of the single excess computing node and with no specified expiration e.g. indicating that the request is to continuously execute and or re execute until the program execution is completed . In this example all of the computing nodes may provide approximately or exactly the same amount of computing capacity per time interval while in other embodiments a standard amount of program execution capacity may be indicated in other manners e.g. with a logical computing node measure that corresponds to a particular amount of computing resources and with particular actual computing nodes being rated as to the number of logical computing nodes that they provide. In other embodiments the various requests may be configured in other ways such as to include one or more of a specified particular type of computing node to use e.g. and or characteristics of such computing nodes a minimum and or maximum bid amount and or one or more other configurations e.g. fault tolerance requirements execution locality and or proximity preferences etc. . In addition other types of information may be indicated in some embodiments such as one or more particular programs to be executed for each request a total amount of aggregate computing node time intervals for the request etc.

The illustrated table includes a number of dedicated capacity computing nodes such as computing nodes that have been allocated for dedicated access to one or more specific dedicated capacity users of the program execution service and also includes a number of other computing nodes such as computing nodes that may be available for other types of program execution capacity e.g. on demand variable program execution capacity . For example a dedicated capacity user not shown may have priority access to the specific computing node for a specified period of time e.g. a year such that the user may access computing node to execute programs on behalf of the user at any time during the specified period of time although such access may be subject to a delay period and or one or more interactions on the part of the user to gain access e.g. notifications of an intent to use the computing node at a particular time a request to execute programs on computing node etc. . In other embodiments the dedicated capacity user not shown may instead have priority access to a computing node with equivalent computing resources as computing node e.g. equivalent processing capacity memory etc. but not have a particular allocated computing node such that the user may be provided access to any of the computing nodes that are equivalent to for executing programs on behalf of the user and that are available for use. In various such embodiments the program execution service may ensure that a sufficient number of dedicated computing nodes equivalent to are available for use by dedicated users who may have priority access to such computing nodes in various ways e.g. maintaining a group of such computing nodes and or otherwise reserving a specific amount of such nodes etc. .

In table during interval dedicated computing node has been determined to be excess capacity such as based on being unused by a dedicated capacity user to whom computing node is allocated and has thus been made available for use by excess capacity users. For example the dedicated capacity user may have interacted with the program execution service to indicate that computing node is available for excess program execution capacity such as at some time prior to time interval or the program execution service may have instead automatically determined that the computing node was unused. In the illustrated example all other of the illustrated computing nodes e.g. and have not been determined to be available during the interval . During time interval request A is received and the program execution service determines to execute a program associated with request A on the available excess capacity computing node for the user specified fee of 0.05 hour and initiates execution of the program on computing node . In other embodiments the program execution service may instead have a fixed price fee that some or all excess capacity users use.

At time interval the program execution service determines that computing node is no longer available to satisfy excess program execution capacity requests e.g. based on an indication received from a dedicated capacity user reclaiming use of the computing node and so the execution of the program associated with request A is terminated on computing node . At interval the program execution service determines that two computing nodes with sufficient resources to execute request A e.g. dedicated computing nodes and are available as excess capacity computing nodes and determines to reinitiate execution of request A s program on dedicated computing node . In the illustrated embodiment the diagonal lines at time interval with respect to dedicated computing node indicate that node is available during that time interval for use as excess computing capacity but is not preferred for excess computing capacity use and thus is not selected to satisfy request A. Computing node is not preferred for various reasons such as it having a short and or uncertain duration of availability e.g. as determined by the program execution service such as based on indications from the dedicated capacity user to whom it is allocated based on prior history of use based on forecasted use etc. whereas node may be determined to have an availability that is likely to be relatively longer than node . In such a situation the program execution service may have a preference for selecting a computing node with a longer likely availability for executing a request of an excess capacity user such as to minimize having to start stop execution programs on the various computing nodes etc. Thus in this example computing node is not used during time interval but if another excess computing capacity request had been received prior to time interval node may have nonetheless been used for that other request.

In this example request B is received at interval as illustrated by table . In this case there is only one excess computing node available at that time e.g. dedicated computing node and the program execution service determines to terminate the execution of the program for request A in lieu of the program of request B such as based on request B having a higher bid amount e.g. 0.08 hour than request A e.g. 0.05 hour or otherwise having a higher priority. In this example request B is executed continuously on dedicated computing node for a fee of 0.08 hour over the time intervals . At time interval two computing nodes are available as excess computing nodes dedicated computing nodes and each having sufficient resources for executing the program for request B since request B specifies a maximum of two computing nodes the program of request B remains executing on node in the illustrated embodiment and is also initiated on node

At time interval three dedicated computing nodes are determined to be available as excess capacity computing nodes computing nodes and and request C is received. In this embodiment the programs of request B are terminated from execution on dedicated computing nodes and and one or more programs associated with request C are executed on all three of the available excess computing nodes based on request C having an indicated preference to execute on a maximum of three nodes and having a relatively higher bid amount e.g. 0.10 hour than requests A and B thus providing a higher priority for request C than for requests A and B. At time interval two dedicated computing nodes are determined to be available as excess computing nodes computing nodes and such as based on computing node having been reclaimed for other purposes or otherwise having become unavailable. The one or more programs associated with request C are terminated on computing node but remain executing on nodes and such as based on the preferred maximum and minimum number of computing nodes for request C and request C having a higher priority than requests A and B. The program s of request C continue to execute on computing node at time interval but the execution on computing node is terminated due to the computing node becoming unavailable for excess computing capacity use. After time interval the program execution service determines that request C has executed for at least three hours over the time intervals and has thus expired. Accordingly the program execution service terminates execution of the programs associated with request C on the excess capacity computing nodes and request C is no longer treated as a pending request to be satisfied. At time interval one computing node dedicated computing node is determined to continue to be available for use as excess program execution capacity and the execution of the program associated with request B is reinitiated on the computing node.

During time interval the execution of the program s for request B ends e.g. based on the program s completing their execution after 5 aggregate hours of execution or instead based on an instruction received not shown to cancel request B from the excess capacity user who submitted request B and request B is treated as no longer being a pending request to be satisfied. In addition at or near this time request D is received having a bid amount equivalent to previously received request A e.g. 0.05 hour . In this case the program execution service determines to reinitiate execution of the program associated with request A on available dedicated computing node at next time interval rather than the program associated with request D based on request A having been received at an earlier time than D. Request A continues to execute on node until some unknown future time after time interval . At interval one of the other computing nodes becomes available for use as excess program execution capacity and is determined to be a non preferred excess capacity computing node but the program of request D is nonetheless executed on the other computing node since no other excess computing nodes are currently available.

In the illustrative example of the program execution service may further track usage of the computing nodes corresponding to the various requests A D such that the various associated users are charged fees corresponding to the bid amounts indicated by the various requests. In addition the program execution service may also track which of the computing nodes were used and or were made available for use by excess capacity users such that one or more users associated with those computing nodes may be given some portion of the fees collected from the excess capacity users.

In particular in the example of the user who submits request B referred to as Requester B in is also a dedicated capacity user and has been allocated the dedicated use of computing node for a time period that includes time intervals as shown by information . Accordingly in the shading for computing node has been changed to include crosshatching to reflect that any unused capacity of computing node is available for use as a private excess capacity pool for Requester B . In this example the time intervals of and for computing node correspond to dedicated use of computing node by Requester B and thus computing node is available during the time intervals of for use as part of the private excess computing capacity pool for Requester B . As discussed in greater detail elsewhere requests from Requester B have priority for use of the private excess computing capacity pool.

The assignments for time intervals are the same in as in . For example request B from Requester B was already assigned to use computing node for time intervals in based on request B having a higher priority for the general excess computing capacity pool in than request A and thus the use of computing node for the private excess computing capacity pool in does not alter those prior assignments. However after request C is received for time interval the assignments change in relative to based on the use of the private excess computing capacity pool. In particular in request C was given higher priority than requests A and B for the general excess computing capacity pool and thus all three excess computing capacity nodes available at time interval in began to execute the program s for request C. With respect to however request B from Requester B continues to have the highest priority at time interval for the excess computing capacity in Requester B s private excess computing capacity pool accordingly the program s for request C similarly begin to execute on computing nodes and at time interval j in but the program s for request B continue to execute on computing node at that time interval in in a manner different from that of . In particular since a request from Requester B is available at time interval that request in this example request B is given priority to use the excess computing capacity of computing node that is part of Requester B s private excess computing capacity pool. Similarly at the subsequent time interval if the program s for request B had continued to execute those program s would have continued to execute on computing node for the same reasons based on the higher priority of request B than request C for the private excess computing capacity pool of Requester B . However in this example since request B ends after 5 aggregate hours of program execution the program s of request B end after time interval . Accordingly the excess computing capacity for computing node at time interval returns to the general excess computing capacity pool and the program s of request C begin to execute on computing node for time interval

Thus the use of the private excess computing capacity pool provides various benefits for Requester B in the example of . For example as a first benefit request B is completed more rapidly in the example of in particular by the end of time interval in rather than the end of time interval in . In addition as a second benefit in the example of the performance of request B is performed more cheaply for Requester B than the performance of request B in . In particular in the example of the use of the private excess computing capacity pool by Requester B is charged to Requester B at the same rate as the incremental on going cost of using dedicated computing node which in this example is 0.04 per time interval hour as shown in information . Thus while the performance of request B in would have cost the request B bid price of 0.08 per time interval hour i.e. twice that amount for each time interval hour as the incremental on going cost of using dedicated computing node for each of the 5 aggregate hours of execution of the program s for request B in the cost for performing request B is only 0.04 per time interval hour for the four of the five aggregate hours in which the private excess computing capacity pool was used as shown in cost information . For the other time interval hour during which request B is executed on computing node in as part of the general excess computing capacity pool the cost is charged at the request

B bid price of 0.08 per time interval hour as shown in cost information Thus the total cost for performing request B in is 0.24 while the total cost for performing request B in is 0.40. While the absolute numbers are small in this example based on the limited amount of use of excess computing capacity it will be appreciated that increasing such excess computing capacity by a significant amount in a real world situation may result in correspondingly larger actual cost savings e.g. if use is increased a thousand fold the corresponding savings would be 1600 in this example based on actual costs of 2400 rather than 4000 .

Furthermore in other situations request B may be performed even more cheaply than in the example of . For example in one of the five aggregate hours of execution of the program s of request B i.e. 20 of the total aggregate hours of execution was performed using the general excess computing capacity pool i.e. use of the time interval of for computing node and an available other hour from the private excess computing capacity pool i.e. time interval for computing node was not used. Thus in other situations the execution of the program s for request B may instead use the private excess computing capacity pool for all of the execution of the program s for request B and thus be charged at the lower cost of the private excess computing capacity pool for all of that execution. Such use of the private excess computing capacity pool may be triggered by for example request B having instead specified a maximum of one computing node so that only the private excess computing capacity pool is used if it is available . Alternatively in other embodiments Requester B may specify that request B or one or more other requests is only to be executed using his her private excess computing capacity pool rather than to also use the general excess computing capacity pool as a supplement to the private excess computing capacity pool.

In addition in some embodiments the private excess computing capacity pool may further be used in other manners to provide other benefits. For example consider a situation similar to that of but in which request B has a higher priority than request C for use of the general excess computing capacity pool e.g. if request C has a bid price of 0.07 rather than 0.10 in which request B uses six aggregate hours to complete execution of its program s rather than five aggregate hours and in which request B specifies to use a maximum of one computing node rather than two. In such a situation and using the allocation scheme previously described for request B would not be selected to use computing node in time interval from the general excess computing capacity given the maximum of one computing node and the preference for using the private excess computing capacity pool but would be selected to continue to use computing node in time interval from the private excess computing capacity pool. However in that situation at the end of time interval request B would still have 1 additional hour of execution until completion but the availability of computing node in the private excess computing capacity pool at time interval would disappear based on the resumed use of dedicated capacity by Requester B at that time interval. Thus one option in that situation would be to terminate the execution of the program s for request B on computing node at the end of time interval and to immediately resume the execution of those program s for one additional hour on computing node during time interval . However in other embodiments other possible actions may be taken. For example to avoid the overhead of terminating and then restarting the execution of the program s for request B when only a short time remains until completion those program s for request B could instead be allowed to complete their execution on computing node during some or all of time interval . While Requester B s desire to resume dedicated capacity use in time interval could be deferred in this situation an alternative that accommodates such a resumption of dedicated capacity use in time interval includes selecting another computing node to temporarily use for Requester B s dedicated capacity use during at least time interval such as computing node . In this manner Requester B receives the desired dedicated capacity use in time interval and the execution of the program s for request B is allowed to complete more efficiently and quickly. Nonetheless in such an example the use of computing node during time interval for the completion of the execution of the program s for request B may not be treated for cost purposes in at least some such embodiments as being part of the private excess computing capacity pool such that Requester B may receive the dedicated capacity use price of 0.04 for the use of computing node during time interval but the execution of the program s for request B using computing node during time interval may be charged at the general excess computing capacity pool price of 0.08 to reflect request B s bid price. It will be appreciated that other alternatives may similarly be used in other embodiments and situations.

In addition it will be appreciated that the preceding examples are provided for illustrative purposes and that other embodiments may differ in various ways from the example. For example although the computing nodes are depicted as being equivalent e.g. having equivalent computing resources other embodiments may be provided where various of the computing nodes may be of different types with varying characteristics e.g. different amounts of processing capacity memory platform specification etc. . In some such embodiments various of the requests may include indications of one or more specific types of the computing nodes for use in executing programs associated with the requests and those requests may only be executed on the corresponding specified type of computing node. In addition in some embodiments rather than excess computing capacity being based on unused dedicated computing nodes and other computing nodes as illustrated embodiments may exist where only one group of computing nodes and or additional groups of computing nodes may contribute to excess capacity computing nodes available for executing requests of excess capacity users. Furthermore in some embodiments at least some of the other computing nodes may include computing nodes provided to the program execution service by one or more third parties.

As previously discussed various types of functionality may be provided and used by a PES in various embodiments and the functionality may be provided in various ways. For example in some embodiments program execution capacity available from a PES may include multiple computing nodes for executing programs on behalf of users such as via multiple physical computing machines interconnected via one or more networks or other data exchange mediums that are capable of transmitting data between the computing machines. At least some of the computing machines may in some embodiments each include sufficient computing related resources to execute multiple programs simultaneously e.g. sufficient writeable memory non volatile storage CPU cycles or other CPU usage measure network bandwidth swap space etc. and at least some of the computing machines in some such embodiments may each host multiple virtual machine computing nodes that each may execute one or more programs on behalf of a distinct user. Furthermore in various embodiments a PES may execute various types of programs on behalf of multiple users. For example such programs executed on behalf of users may include one or more operating systems applications e.g. servers and or other software applications utilities libraries etc. In addition in at least some embodiments such programs may include executable software images such as virtual machine images that are bootable or otherwise loadable on one or more virtual machine computing nodes and that each may include operating system software software for one or more application programs and or configuration information etc.

In at least some embodiments the execution of one or more programs on one or more computing nodes by a PES may be initiated in response to a current execution request for immediate execution of those programs. Alternatively the initiation may be based on a previously received program execution request that scheduled or otherwise reserved the then future execution of those programs for the now current time. Program execution requests may be received in various ways such as directly from a user e.g. via an interactive console or other GUI provided by the program execution service or from an executing program of a user that automatically initiates the execution of one or more other programs or other instances of itself e.g. via an API or application programming interface provided by the program execution service such as an API that uses Web services . Program execution requests may include various information to be used in the initiation of the execution of one or more programs such as an executable or other copy of a program to be executed an indication of a program that was previously registered or otherwise supplied for execution and a number of instances of the program that are to be executed simultaneously e.g. expressed as a single desired number of instances as a minimum and maximum number of desired instances etc. as well as a variety of other types of preferences and or requirements for execution of one or more programs e.g. resource allocation geographical and or logical location for execution proximity of execution to other programs and or computing nodes timing related criteria etc. .

After receiving a request to execute one or more instances of a program at an indicated time the PES may determine one or more computing nodes to use in executing the program instances. In some embodiments the determination of the computing nodes to be used is performed at the time of the request even if for future execution. In other embodiments the determination of the computing nodes to be used for future execution of one or more program instances may be deferred to a later time such as at the future time of execution based on information that is then available. In some embodiments the determination of which computing nodes to use for execution of one or more programs on behalf of a user may be made prior to a request to execute such as at a time when a user subscribes and or registers to use the PES and or at another time prior to a request to execute programs for a user. For example in some such embodiments one or more computing nodes may be associated with a user for a period of time such that programs may be executed on behalf of that user on the associated computing nodes at any time during that period such as at any time a request is received to execute software for the user during the period. In addition in some embodiments the determination of which computing nodes to use to execute programs on behalf of a user may be made when one or more computing nodes and or computing resources of one or more computing nodes become available for executing programs for the user such as for example to execute programs of one or more pending requests on one or more computing nodes at a time when the computing nodes are unused and or are otherwise available for executing the programs.

The determination of which computing nodes to use for execution of each program instance may be made in a variety of ways including based on any preferences and or requirements specified in the request or otherwise specified for the program and or associated user e.g. at a time of registration etc. . For example if criteria are determined for preferred and or required resources for execution of a program instance e.g. memory and or storage CPU type cycles or other performance metric network capacity platform type etc. the determination of an appropriate computing node to execute a program instance may be based at least in part on whether a computing node has sufficient resources available to satisfy those resource criteria. Additional details related to executing and configuring programs to execute on a program execution service are included in pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 395 463 filed Mar. 31 2006 and entitled Managing Execution of Programs by Multiple Computing Systems which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

In addition as previously noted in at least some embodiments execution of a program using excess program execution capacity that is automatically terminated may be automatically reinitiated at a later time by the PES. For example in some such cases the PES may continue to try to execute a program until completion of the requested execution e.g. until cancelled or otherwise explicitly terminated by a user until an indication is received that the one or more programs have completed one or more tasks etc. until occurrence of a specified time e.g. until occurrence of an expiration time until occurrence of a cumulative execution time etc until occurrence of a specified number of executions indefinitely etc.

In some embodiments fees may be associated with the use of a PES such that the PES may execute programs on behalf of a user in exchange for payment of one or more fees by that user. For example in some embodiments fees may be charged to a user based on an amount and or type of program execution capacity allocated for executing one or more programs on behalf of a user such as based on one or more of a number of processing units an amount of memory an amount of storage an amount of network resources etc. allocated for executing programs of the user. In some embodiments fees may be based on other factors such as various characteristics of the computing resources used to execute programs such as for example based on CPU capabilities or performance platform type e.g. 32 bit 64 bit etc. etc. In some embodiments fees may be charged on the basis of a variety of use factors such as a price per use of the service a price per unit of time that computing services are used a price per storage used a price per data transferred in and or out etc. In at least some embodiments as discussed in more detail below fees may be based on various other factors such as related to availability of the program execution capacity e.g. varying degrees of availability such as guaranteed availability and or variable availability and or various properties related to executing programs e.g. continuity of execution fault tolerance etc. . In at least some embodiments a provider of a PES may offer one or more of various tiers types and or levels of services or functionality for executing programs on behalf of multiple users and in some such embodiments various fees may be associated with the various tiers types and or levels of services. For example in some embodiments a user may be charged one or more fees in conjunction with use of dedicated program execution capacity functionality provided by a PES such as fees that are respectively lower than fees associated with comparable use of an on demand variable program execution capacity service of the PES. The lower fees may reflect for example the user entering into a long term agreement for a specified use time period e.g. a number of weeks months years etc. such as to pay one or more specific rates over the term of the agreement e.g. up front and or periodically . In addition for example tiers may be used for a specific type of functionality provided by a PES such as to charge fees at a first tier for a first quantity of dedicated program execution capacity functionality e.g. up to a specified first threshold of computing nodes being used to charge fees at a second tier e.g. a lower price tier for a second quantity of dedicated program execution capacity functionality e.g. above the specified first threshold and up to a specified second threshold of computing nodes being used etc. Tiers may further be based on various factors other than quantity of functionality that is used in at least some embodiments whether instead of or in addition to being based on quantity of functionality used. Additional details related to various fees associated with a program execution service are included in pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 963 331 filed Dec. 21 2007 and entitled Providing Configurable Pricing for Execution of Software Images which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

A use time period for a period of dedicated computing capacity may be specified in various manners in various embodiments such as to indicate a specified period of time in which a user has access to dedicated program execution capacity e.g. a number of days weeks months years etc. a duration of time in which one or more programs may be continuously executed for a user e.g. a number of hours the one or more programs may execute within any given period such as an hour a day an hour a week etc. a window of time in which one or more programs may execute e.g. between 1 00 p.m. and 3 00 p.m. every other day etc. As previously noted in some embodiments an electronic marketplace may be provided for users of a PES such that dedicated program execution capacity users may provide some or all of their specified use time period for dedicated program execution capacity to one or more other users in exchange for payment from those one or more other users such that the one or more other users may use the provided portions of dedicated program execution capacity to execute programs on behalf of the one or more other users and the dedicated program execution capacity user may receive payment for such use. In other embodiments a dedicated program execution capacity user may temporarily provide use of some portion of her dedicated program execution capacity for use by one or more users based in part on the one or more other users having an urgent need of the program execution capacity such as indicated by a willingness of the one or more users to pay a premium for use of the dedicated program execution capacity e.g. a rate greater than that paid by the dedicated program execution capacity user and in at least some such embodiments a portion and or all of the fees collected from the one or more users may be provided to the dedicated capacity user.

Furthermore various other types of functionality may be provided and used by a PES in various embodiments as discussed in greater detail elsewhere.

An embodiment of a Program Execution Service System Manager module is executing in memory and it interacts with computing systems and and computing nodes over the network e.g. via the Internet and or the World Wide Web via a private cellular network etc. . In this example embodiment the PESSM may for example include software instructions that when executed program one or more processors e.g. CPU to perform some or all of the described techniques including functionality related to managing use of multiple computing nodes by various users not shown interacting with user computing systems such as in conjunction with a program execution service managed by the PESSM . The other computing systems and and computing nodes may be executing various software as part of interactions with the PESSM. For example user computing systems may be executing software in memory to interact with PESSM e.g. as part of a Web browser or specialized client side application program such as to configure and or request execution of programs on behalf of the users of those systems on one or more computing nodes in various ways such as related to variable execution capacity use dedicated execution capacity use and or excess execution capacity use. In addition one or more users of the user computing systems may interact with PESSM to perform various other types of actions as discussed in greater detail elsewhere. Various information related to the functionality of the PESSM module may be stored in storage such as information related to private excess capacity pools e.g. tracked current availability user instructions related to configuration and or other configuration information etc. and other information e.g. information related to configuration execution and or registration for executing programs on behalf of multiple users .

In this example the PESSM module includes three constituent modules including a Dedicated Capacity Usage Manager module an Excess Capacity Usage Manager module and an On Demand Variable Capacity Usage Manager module . The Dedicated Capacity Usage Manager module manages the use of dedicated computing capacity by users with illustrating a routine corresponding to operations of the module in one example embodiment. The Excess Capacity Usage Manager module manages the use of general and private excess computing capacity pools by users with illustrating a routine corresponding to operations of the module in one example embodiment. The On Demand Variable Capacity Usage Manager module manages the use of on demand variable computing capacity by users with illustrating a routine corresponding to operations of the module in one example embodiment. In other embodiments the functionality provided by the PESSM module may be structured in other manners including to optionally not include one or more of the constituent modules e.g. to not include the On Demand Variable Capacity Usage Manager module for an embodiment that does not provide on demand variable capacity usage .

After the PESSM module receives a request or other indication to execute one or more programs on one or more computing nodes the PESSM module determines a constituent module that corresponds to the indicated type of program execution capacity to use and forwards the request to the determined constituent module. The determined constituent module and the PESSM module then perform various operations to respond to the request such as selecting the one or more computing nodes that will execute the one or more programs and initiating execution of those programs on those computing nodes . In addition the PESSM module including constituent modules may further perform operations to interact with computing nodes to terminate execution of initiated programs on the computing nodes to migrate one or more of the programs to one or more other computing nodes or computing systems to monitor or otherwise interact with one or more of the computing nodes to track use of those computing nodes etc. The computing nodes may have various forms in various embodiments such as to include a number of physical computing systems and or a number of virtual machines executing on one or more physical computing systems. In some embodiments the server computing system and computing nodes may be part of a data center or other group of co located computing systems or may otherwise be computing nodes of a private network. In addition in some embodiments the PESSM module may interact with one or more other computing systems to initiate or terminate execution of one or more programs on those computing systems such as if the computing systems are provided by one or more third party participants who are providing excess program execution capacity for use by other users. In some embodiments the PESSM module may further or instead manage access to one or more types of computing related resources or services other than program execution services e.g. persistent or temporary data storage services messaging services database services etc. .

It will be appreciated that computing systems and and computing nodes are merely illustrative and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. The computing systems and or nodes may instead each include multiple interacting computing systems or devices and the computing systems nodes may be connected to other devices that are not illustrated including through one or more networks such as the Internet via the Web or via private networks e.g. mobile communication networks etc. . More generally a computing node or other computing system may comprise any combination of hardware or software that may interact and perform the described types of functionality including without limitation desktop or other computers database servers network storage devices and other network devices PDAs cellphones wireless phones pagers electronic organizers Internet appliances television based systems e.g. using set top boxes and or personal digital video recorders and various other consumer products that include appropriate communication capabilities. In addition the functionality provided by the illustrated PESSM module and its constituent modules may in some embodiments be distributed in additional modules or combined in fewer modules. Similarly in some embodiments some of the functionality of the PESSM module may not be provided and or other additional functionality may be available.

It will also be appreciated that while various items are illustrated as being stored in memory or on storage while being used these items or portions of them may be transferred between memory and other storage devices for purposes of memory management and data integrity. Alternatively in other embodiments some or all of the software PESSM module and or constituent modules may execute in memory on another device and communicate with the illustrated computing systems via inter computer communication. Furthermore in some embodiments some or all of the PESSM module and or constituent modules may be implemented or provided in other manners such as at least partially in firmware and or hardware including but not limited to one or more application specific integrated circuits ASICs standard integrated circuits controllers e.g. by executing appropriate instructions and including microcontrollers and or embedded controllers field programmable gate arrays FPGAs complex programmable logic devices CPLDs etc. Some or all of the modules and data structures may also be stored e.g. as software instructions or structured data on a computer readable medium such as a hard disk a memory a network or a portable media article to be read by an appropriate drive or via an appropriate connection. The modules and data structures may also be transmitted as generated data signals e.g. as part of a carrier wave or other analog or digital propagated signal on a variety of computer readable transmission mediums including wireless based and wired cable based mediums and may take a variety of forms e.g. as part of a single or multiplexed analog signal or as multiple discrete digital packets or frames . Such computer program products may also take other forms in other embodiments. Accordingly the present invention may be practiced with other computer system configurations.

In the illustrated embodiment the routine begins at block where information or a request is received. The routine continues to block to determine if the received request or information is related to dedicated capacity use. If so the routine continues to block to perform a routine related to managing dedicated computing capacity usage with one example embodiment of such a routine being discussed in greater detail with respect to . If it is instead determined at block that the information or request of block is not related to dedicated capacity use the routine continues to block to determine if the information or request is related to excess computing capacity use. If so the routine continues to block to perform a routine related to managing excess computing capacity usage with one example embodiment of such a routine being discussed in greater detail with respect to . If it is instead determined at block that the information or request of block is not related to excess capacity use the routine continues to block to determine if the information or request is related to on demand variable computing capacity use. If so the routine continues to block to perform a routine related to managing on demand variable computing capacity usage with one example embodiment of such a routine being discussed in greater detail with respect to .

If it is instead determined at block that information or a request related to variable capacity use is not received the routine continues to block to determine if the information or request is related to a secondary dedicated capacity market and if so the routine continues to block to perform one or more indicated operations as appropriate related to a secondary dedicated capacity market. For example in various embodiments such operations may include one or more of indications from dedicated capacity users to sell and or rent various amounts of the users dedicated program execution capacity indications from one or more other users to buy and or rent program execution capacity from dedicated capacity users indications from one or more urgent users who may be willing to pay a premium for various amounts of program execution capacity etc.

After blocks and or if it is instead determined in block that information or a request related to a secondary dedicated capacity market is not received the routine continues to block to optionally perform any user billing or reimbursement activities based on the information or request received in block or as is otherwise initiated e.g. periodically such as to charge and or collect fees from one or more users e.g. dedicated capacity users variable capacity users excess capacity users and or others based on program execution functionality provided to the users and or to pay and or reimburse one or more users e.g. dedicated capacity users and or others who provided computing resources for use by excess capacity users etc. for functionality provided by or enabled by the users.

After block the routine continues to block to optionally monitor for excess program execution capacity for any general excess computing capacity pools and private excess computing capacity pools in use such that program execution capacity may be added and or removed from the excess program execution capacity available for use by one or more excess capacity users. In other embodiments the routine may receive other indications of current and or expected usage of program execution capacity such as notifications from one or more computing resources of the program execution service e.g. such as computing nodes with resident monitors that may indicate current usage status notifications from one or more users and or may otherwise determine when computing resources are and or are likely to be used unused or underutilized.

Next the routine continues to block to optionally perform one or more other indicated operations. In some embodiments such operations may include configuring use of various resources and or functionality of the program execution service for users subscription or registration operations scheduling operations etc. After block the routine continues to block to determine whether to continue such as until an explicit indication to terminate execution of the routine is received. If so the routine returns to block and if not the routine continues to block and ends.

In the illustrated embodiment the routine begins at block where a request information and or other indication related to dedicated capacity use is received. At block the routine then determines whether a request has been received from a user to subscribe for use of dedicated program execution capacity. If so the routine continues to block where corresponding information is obtained from a subscribing user and various operations related to subscribing for use of dedicated program execution capacity are performed. For example in some embodiments a user may select and or indicate one or more computing nodes to which the user would like dedicated access. As discussed elsewhere in some embodiments a user may select from one or more of various types of computing nodes and or may otherwise specify various amounts and or types of computing resources desired e.g. processing unit type amount memory amount platform specification etc. . In addition a subscribing user may also indicate a desired time period of use over which the user would like dedicated access e.g. a number of hours weeks months years etc. and or may provide other information e.g. billing information indications of programs to execute on behalf of the user scheduling information for executing one or programs at one or more future times etc. . After the subscriber provides information related to a type and or amount of desired dedicated program execution capacity the routine continues to block where an appropriate amount of requested program execution capacity is allocated for dedicated use by the subscribing user if possible. As discussed elsewhere program execution capacity e.g. one or more computing nodes may be allocated and or assigned for use by a particular subscribing dedicated capacity user in various ways in various embodiments.

After block the routine continues to block to optionally determine whether to use at least some of the computing capacity allocated to the subscriber for dedicated use as part of a private pool of excess computing capacity for use by the subscriber and or by other designated users and if so to store corresponding information to enable use of the private excess computing capacity pool. For example in some embodiments private excess computing capacity pools may be enabled and used for decided capacity subscriber users such that all dedicated computing capacity that is allocated to such a user may be made available for possible later use in a private excess computing capacity pool for that user while that dedicated computing capacity is not otherwise being used by the user. Alternatively the PESSM module may in some embodiments create such private excess computing capacity pools for all dedicated capacity users by default unless otherwise instructed. In other embodiments such a private excess computing capacity pool for a dedicated capacity user may not be created in block unless the user provides explicit instructions to do so and or other predetermined criteria are satisfied. In yet other embodiments the determination of whether to create such a private excess capacity pool for a user may instead be performed at other times such as upon receiving a request from such a dedicated capacity user to use excess computing capacity resources. Furthermore in at least some embodiments the subscriber user may configure other aspects of such a private excess computing capacity pool for the user such as how much of the dedicated capacity use is to be available as part of the private excess capacity pool e.g. all a specified percentage or specified number of computing nodes etc. to what users the private excess capacity pool is to be available certain time periods and or other criteria during which the private excess capacity pool is to be available or not available etc.

If it is instead determined at block that a request to subscribe for use of dedicated program execution capacity is not received the routine instead continues to block where the routine determines whether a request is received to execute one or more programs on behalf of a subscriber user on allocated dedicated program execution capacity e.g. a current request for immediate execution a previously scheduled request for execution etc. and that the corresponding dedicated program execution capacity is not already in use or scheduled for use for other dedicated program execution. If sufficient dedicated program execution capacity is not available an error message or other similar response is provided such as with respect to block . In some embodiments the routine may also ensure that the request for execution has been received within an appropriate use period and or may otherwise authorize the request e.g. authenticate the request authorize the subscriber user etc. . If an appropriate request is received for use of dedicated capacity the routine continues to block to determine if the allocated dedicated program execution capacity to be used for the request is currently in use as part of fulfilling a prior request from the requester as part of a private excess computing capacity pool for the requester. If such current private excess computing capacity pool use is identified in block the routine continues to block and otherwise continues to block to perform the requested execution such as by initiating the execution of the one or more programs on the allocated program execution capacity. If the routine first proceeds to block before block the routine in block initiates a transfer of the prior request from the private excess computing capacity pool to a general excess computing capacity pool since the private excess computing capacity pool no longer has current availability to fulfill the prior request although in other embodiments and situations e.g. based on instructions specified for the prior request the routine may instead leave the prior request in a queue for the private excess computing capacity pool so that it is deferred until sufficient capacity becomes available in the private excess computing capacity pool. In some embodiments as part of block the routine may select computing resources and or computing nodes on which to execute the programs in various ways and in some situations the routine may terminate one or more programs of other users e.g. general excess capacity pool users and or otherwise free computing resources to perform the requested execution. In some embodiments if a dedicated capacity user previously supplied some amount of her allocated dedicated program execution capacity for use by one or more other users such as to sell or lease that capacity to another user then the dedicated capacity to fulfill the received request may not be available for use by the dedicated user at the time of the request unless the user is able to reclaim the capacity for the request. In addition in some embodiments the current request from the subscriber user for the use of the dedicated capacity may be temporarily delayed such as to allow a prior request from the subscriber user that is executing as part of a private excess capacity pool for the subscriber user to complete or otherwise perform one or more determined actions.

If it is instead determined at block that a request to execute one or more programs on behalf of a subscribing user on allocated program execution capacity is not received the routine continues to block to optionally perform one or more other indicated operations related to dedicated capacity use as appropriate. For example in some embodiments such operations may include indicating some amount of dedicated program execution capacity to make available as excess program execution capacity whether for a private excess capacity pool and or a general excess capacity pool and or indicating that some amount of previously specified program execution capacity is to be reclaimed for use by the dedicated capacity user. In addition as previously noted the routine in block may provide an error message or other related information if the request received in block is not fulfilled. In addition in some embodiments a request or instruction may be received in block to terminate previously initiated dedicated capacity use and if so the routine in block may perform such program termination and also update the corresponding private excess computing capacity pool if any or general excess computing capacity pool of the resulting available excess capacity in other embodiments the user may instead terminate the execution of the programs on the computing nodes without notifying the routine and the PESSM module may later automatically identify the resulting excess computing capacity e.g. with respect to block of .

In the illustrated embodiment upon invocation of the routine a request information and or other indication related to excess capacity use is provided to the routine at block . At block the routine then determines whether an indication is received to add program execution capacity to available excess program execution capacity such as based on information obtained with respect to block of or as triggered by the termination of use of dedicated computing capacity with respect to block of . If so the routine continues to block to add the indicated program execution capacity to available program execution capacity. In particular if the excess program execution capacity corresponds to a private excess computing capacity pool then that private pool is selected to receive the indicated excess capacity and otherwise a general excess computing capacity pool is selected. In addition in some embodiments requests to create new private excess capacity pools may be received and handled with respect to block or instead with respect to block as discussed below. For example in some embodiments the routine may add one or more indications of such indicated program execution capacity e.g. one or more particular computing nodes etc. to the selected pool of available program execution capacity. In some embodiments multiple pools may be provided as previously discussed with respect to private and general excess capacity pools and or in other manners e.g. various different types of program execution capacity may be available and grouped into corresponding private and or general pools associated with the type of program execution capacity .

If it is instead determined at block that an indication to add excess program execution capacity is not received the routine continues to block to determine whether an indication is received to remove program execution capacity from the available excess program execution capacity. If so the routine continues to block to select a corresponding private and or general excess capacity pool from which the excess capacity is to be removed e.g. based on particular program execution capacity that is indicated such as for one or more programs currently executing using excess capacity . The routine then removes the indicated program execution capacity from the available excess program execution capacity for the selected capacity pool such that the indicated program execution capacity or an equivalent amount of program execution capacity is no longer available as excess program execution capacity to execute programs on behalf of excess capacity users for the selected capacity pool.

If it is instead determined in block that an indication to remove program execution capacity from available program execution capacity is not received the routine continues instead to block to determine whether a request to execute one or more programs on some amount of available excess program execution capacity on behalf of an excess capacity user is received or a previously scheduled request for such execution has been triggered . If so the routine continues to block to select a corresponding private and or general excess capacity pool from which the excess capacity is to be obtained for executing one or more programs for the request e.g. based on the excess capacity user or instead on another indication of particular program execution capacity to use and to optionally obtain or receive additional information from a requesting excess capacity user related to requested execution. In some embodiments such additional information may include configuration information such as indications of an amount and or type of program execution capacity requested e.g. including minimum and maximum amounts a bid amount e.g. including minimum and maximum bid amounts an expiration time a particular excess capacity pool to use e.g. only a particular private excess capacity pool associated with the user or to use a particular private excess capacity pool if available but to otherwise use a general excess capacity pool etc. In some embodiments some or all such additional information may instead be included as part of the request received in block or as part of a separate configuration and or registration performed by the excess capacity user. In addition in some embodiments the routine may provide feedback to an excess capacity user of one or more types such as indicating likely characteristics of the requested execution e.g. a likely time that the request will be executed a likely duration of execution a likely excess capacity pool to be used etc. and or optional other information e.g. suggested configurations . After block the routine continues to block to add the request to a group of current requests for execution on excess program execution capacity for the selected excess capacity pool to be used. In other embodiments rather than add the request to a group of other requests the routine may instead attempt to immediately satisfy the request such as by determining whether there is available excess program execution capacity to execute the request at that immediate time e.g. in a particular private excess capacity pool and initiating execution of the programs if so or taking other action if not e.g. moving the request from the unavailable private excess capacity pool to a general excess capacity pool failing etc. .

If it is instead determined at block that a request to execute programs on available excess program execution capacity is not received the routine continues to block to determine whether a request to remove an indicated previous request for execution is received e.g. a indicated request for execution that was previously added to a group of requests at block such as a request from an excess capacity user to cancel a current request for execution and or a received indication that the request has otherwise expired etc. If so the routine continues to block to terminate any programs associated with the indicated request that are currently executing on some amount of excess program execution capacity and then continues to block to remove the indicated request from one or more groups of requests that include the indicated request such that the indicated request will not subsequently be considered for execution on excess program execution capacity.

After blocks and or if it was instead determined at block that a request to remove an indicated request for execution is not received the routine continues to block to determine whether to manage current requests for execution on excess program execution capacity. For example in some embodiments indication received in block may have been passed into the routine to manage the requests and or may have been provided based upon a change in the available program execution capacity e.g. by adding to or removing from the available program execution capacity in blocks and respectively and or a change in the current request for execution e.g. by adding or removing requests in blocks and respectively etc. If so the routine continues to block to determine an amount of currently available excess program execution capacity for one or more private and or general excess computing capacity pools in use such as including an amount of program execution capacity added and or removed from the available program execution capacity at blocks and respectively. After block the routine continues to block to select pending requests that may be executed using any available private excess computing capacity pools e.g. immediately executed or executed during an upcoming time interval period such as requests that are already being executed using a private excess capacity pool requests that are queued for the private excess capacity pools requests that are currently being executed using a general excess capacity pool but that have a corresponding private excess capacity pool that is preferred if it is available requests that are currently being queued for a general excess capacity pool but that have a corresponding private excess capacity pool that is preferred if it is available etc. For any such selected requests the routine in block then allocates a corresponding amount of excess computing capacity from the corresponding private excess computing capacity pool or schedules such an allocation for an upcoming time interval period . The routine then continues to block to with respect to any remaining requests that are not selected in block select other requests to be executed using one or more general excess computing capacity pools e.g. immediately executed or executed during an upcoming time interval period and allocate groups of the currently available excess program execution capacity from the corresponding general excess computing capacity pool s for use by those selected other requests.

As discussed in greater detail the selection of requests in blocks and may be performed in various manners in various embodiments including based at least in part on priorities associated with the requests and their users. For example in some embodiments the routine attempts to allocate an amount of the excess program execution capacity from a corresponding excess computing capacity pool to each request based on its request e.g. a number of computing nodes specified etc. . In some such embodiments if there is sufficient currently available excess program execution capacity to satisfy all the current requests for execution for a particular excess computing capacity pool then each of the requests will be allocated a requested amount of that excess program execution capacity for executing programs associated with the request. In cases where there is not sufficient currently available excess program execution capacity to satisfy all the current requests for a particular excess computing capacity pool the routine prioritizes the requests and attempts to satisfy higher priority requests prior to lower priority requests. In various embodiments priority may be based on one or more of a particular user associated with a private excess computing capacity pool a bid amount a time at which the request was received etc. In various embodiments the routine may determine which of the currently available excess program execution capacity to allocate for use by the requests in various ways such as described elsewhere.

After block the routine continues to block to terminate any executing programs associated with a request that are already executing on excess program execution capacity but that were not selected for current execution in blocks and such as to reflect that the request has expired or was not sufficiently high priority to result in current ongoing satisfaction. In block the routine then executes one or more programs associated with each of the requests and or leaves previously executing programs on excess program execution capacity that was selected for ongoing execution in block . After block the routine continues to block to optionally perform housekeeping operations. For example in some embodiments the routine may detect and indicate if there are any requests for execution in the group of requests that are expired or otherwise should be removed or moved between excess computing capacity pools.

If it is instead determined at block not to manage current requests for execution on excess program execution capacity the routine continues to block to optionally perform one or more other indicated operations as appropriate. For example the request received in block may be from a user to create a new private excess capacity pool for the user e.g. based on using some or all of some dedicated capacity allocated to the user such as in a manner similar to that discussed with respect to block of or to modify the configuration of an existing private excess capacity pool if so the routine may perform corresponding actions in block . After blocks or the routine continues to block and returns.

In the illustrated embodiment the routine begins at block where a request information and or other indication related to on demand variable capacity use is received. At block the routine then determines if the request is to execute one or more programs on currently available on demand variable computing capacity e.g. a current request for immediate execution a previously scheduled request etc. . As discussed elsewhere such a request may specify various types and or amounts of program execution capacity on which to execute one or more programs on behalf of a variable capacity user. If it is determined in block that a request to execute one or more programs is received the routine continues to block . At blocks and the routine then determines whether the requested program execution capacity is currently available. If so the routine continues to block to initiate the execution of the one or more indicated programs on the available variable program execution capacity. If not the routine continues to block where the request for variable program execution capacity fails such as by not executing the requested one or more programs. In other embodiments other actions may optionally be taken in such situations such as to query the user whether to move the request to a queue for use with excess computing capacity or to instead automatically perform such a move in at least some embodiments and situations. In addition in some embodiments in response to a request to execute programs on variable program execution capacity the routine may automatically terminate one or more programs of excess capacity users to free variable program execution capacity such as by sending a corresponding request to an Excess Capacity Usage Manager module.

If it is instead determined in block that a request to execute one or more programs is not received the routine continues to block to perform one or more other operations as appropriate. After blocks or the routine continues to block and returns.

It will be appreciated that in some embodiments the functionality provided by the routines discussed above may be provided in alternative ways such as being split among more routines or consolidated into fewer routines. Similarly in some embodiments illustrated routines may provide more or less functionality than is described such as when other illustrated routines instead lack or include such functionality respectively or when the amount of functionality that is provided is altered.
