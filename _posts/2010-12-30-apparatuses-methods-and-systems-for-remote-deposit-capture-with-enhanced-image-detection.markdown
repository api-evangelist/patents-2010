The RDC Detection provides a platform that allows a user to deposit a check by taking an image of the check and electronically transmitting the image to the user s bank. For example in one embodiment the user may operate a smart phone e.g. an Apple iPhone etc. to initiate the remote deposit wherein the smart phone may automatically download and instantiate a remote deposit software component which controls the smart phone to capture via its built in camera process and send the image of the check. For another example the user may perform remote deposit by downloading and instantiating the remote deposit software component on their home computer connected to a standard home use or office use scanner photocopier fax machine. In one embodiment the user s bank may receive and process the image of the check to obtain deposit information e.g. via optical character recognition etc. and complete the requested deposit based on the deposit information.

The various embodiments described herein may be electronically performed by different entities such as but not limited to a bank server a user device a third party agent and or the like. Those embodiments may also be performed by other entities.

The client device may then generate a check capture image via camera scanner web camera mobile phone etc. under control of the RDC processing component running on the personal computer and or the mobile phone and generate a check deposit message . For example the check deposit message may comprise the captured check image and any check deposit metadata such as user entered deposit amount user account number and or the like.

In one implementation the payee s bank may process the received check message to generate a deposit check message for the clearinghouse and payor s bank . Upon clearing the check the payee s bank may receive deposit confirmation message from the payor s bank for amount withdrawal confirmation from the payor s account and a confirmation message from the clearinghouse for check clearance confirmation.

This disclosure details the implementation of apparatuses methods and systems of remote deposit capture with enhanced check image detection hereinafter RDC Detection . RDC Detection systems may in one embodiment implement a remote deposit application on a secured network system whereby the remote deposit application may obtain process and store images of a negotiable instrument and generate virtualized negotiable instruments for deposit.

For example in one embodiment a user e.g. the payee who wants to deposit a check may capture an image of the check by a user image capture device e.g. a scanner connected to a computer a mobile device having a built in camera a digital camera and or the like. In another implementation the user may take a video clip of the check and submit the video file. In one embodiment the user may send the captured check image to a financial institution e.g. a payee s bank with RDC Detection service. The RDC Detection platform receiving the check image may then process the check image and extract deposit data from the digital check image. For example in one implementation the RDC Detection may perform a series of image analysis procedures to enhance the received check image and extract deposit information such as payee s name payee s bank account number bank routing number deposit amount and or the like. In one implementation after initial verification of the extracted deposit data the RDC Detection may post the deposit through direct banking and save the check image and the associated check deposit information in a transaction depository. In one implementation the RDC Detection may generate a substitute check e.g. an X9.37 cash letter file based on the received check image and send it to a clearinghouse bank e.g. a regional branch of the Federal Reserve for check clearance. In one implementation the RDC Detection may confirm or cancel the soft posting of deposit funds based on the result of check clearance.

In another example implementation a user may deposit cash or a check at a third party agent which is located remotely from a bank. For example the third party agent may include but is not limited to a point of sale at a store participating in the RDC Detection service a RDC Detection terminal located at a gas station and or the like. In another implementation the third party agent may be an express mailing service representative carrying a portable check cash reading device to provide RDC Detection service e.g. UPS Fedex etc. In one implementation the user may walk in a RDC Detection participating store and present a check or cash for deposit. The third party agent may process the remote deposit request by generating and sending an image of the check to a remote deposit server or by calculating and verifying the presented cash for deposit.

In in one implementation a home scanner or other home image capture device connected to a computer may be utilized for home deposit. In one embodiment the home deposit may be implemented via a web application and or an enterprise capture applet if the depositor is an enterprise entity embedded in a deposit website. For example in one implementation a user may visit a RDC Detection website to perform remote deposit. In one implementation the deposit web service may include scan service to control the scanner to obtain images of a check image service to allow a user to save and edit check image files file selection service and image upload service to facilitate a user to select and upload a check image file and or the like as will be further illustrated in .

In another embodiment for mobile deposit as shown in a pre installed RDC application on the mobile device or the embedded RDC component of a website may control the mobile device to perform member authentication image capturing grayscale conversion of the check image and image upload . For example in one implementation the RDC Detection may prompt the mobile device user to login at the RDC website with a username and password. For another example the RDC Detection may identify the user mobile device to authenticate the user as a member if the mobile device is registered for the RDC service.

In another embodiment as shown in for kiosk ATM retail deposit the facility may provide scan service image upload service and check franking service . For example in one implementation the deposit facility at the kiosk ATM retail may print ELECTRONICALLY PRESENTED across the front of the original check when the check is scanned to avoid representment of the check and endorse the back of the check with deposit confirmation.

In one implementation the RDC Detection third party agent may be equipped with a RDC Detection facility such as a card reader check scanner and or the like so that a user may swipe the check for scanning. In another implementation the RDC Detection third party agent may generate check images for deposit with a general purpose computer and image capture device such as a flatbed scanner a camera a facsimile machine a webcam and or the like.

In one embodiment the RDC Detection third party agent may send deposit requests and deposit information to the financial institution via the communication network . An RDC Detection platform may communicate with the RDC Detection third party agent to process the deposit request. In one implementation the RDC Detection platform may be housed within the payee s bank . In an alternative implementation the RDC Detection platform may be associated with an intermediate deposit service institute that is independent of the payee s bank payer s bank and the clearinghouse bank .

In one implementation for cash deposit the third party agent may receive and calculate cash bills from the user and accumulate cash deposit totals associated with the user and send deposit information to the RDC Detection platform . The RDC Detection platform may wire the deposit amount to the user s bank account periodically. For example in one implementation the RDC Detection platform may wire the received cash amount for deposit during the previous day to the payee s bank for posting on a daily basis as further discussed in .

In another implementation for check deposit the user may provide a bank card as deposit authorization to the third party agent. For example the user may have his ATM debit card swiped at a card reader equipped at a RDC Detection participating store e.g. a Point of Sale POS terminal via which the third party agent may obtain and forward the user s bank account information to the RDC Detection platform .

In one implementation deposit information may be sent to the RDC Detection platform via a secure and dedicated communication channel established between the third party agent and the RDC Detection platform . For example the RDC Detection platform may remotely communicate with and control the deposit facility e.g. the card reader the check scanner etc. installed at the POS terminal or a participating store an ATM machine and or the like. In another implementation the third party agent who operates a general purpose home office device such as a smart phone a computer and or the like may communicate with the RDC Detection platform and submit deposit information in a similar manner as discussed in .

In one embodiment the RDC Detection platform may verify the user s card information and determine whether the user s bank account is eligible for RDC Detection service . Upon authorization the third party agent may process the check deposit including generating one or more images of the check and sending the check images to the RDC Detection platform as further illustrated in C

In one implementation the check images may be sent to and updated at the RDC Detection platform in real time and real time credit may be posted to the user s bank account as further .

In one embodiment upon soft posting the deposit amount to the user s bank account the RDC Detection platform may clear the transaction. In one implementation an Image Cash Letter ICL complying with the Check 21 Act may be generated based on the received check images and deposit data at the RDC Detection platform and sent to a clearinghouse bank for clearing . For example in one implementation the check clearing and may take a similar procedure as further illustrated in .

In one implementation upon soft posting of the deposit funds the RDC Detection server may send notification to the user to the user so that the user may view the conformation message. For example in one implementation the user may receive a confirmation via email . For another example the user may receive a text message of confirmation via his cellular phone or receive an automatic confirmation call .

If the user is not a member of RDC Detection or the card reader fails to recognize the user s bank card the user may be directed to a RDC Detection service representative e.g. a store clerk an express mailman etc. for further assistance . The RDC Detection service may be continued with the service representative .

In one embodiment upon sending member card information to a RDC Detection platform system approval may be received at the third party agent and the user may be presented with a list of available accounts for deposit for selection via user interface and determine whether an expected account is presented. For example a user may have a number of accounts available for deposit but a user preferred account may not be associated or registered for RDC Detection service and thus such an account may not be presented to the user during RDC Detection service. In such case RDC Detection may instruct the user to contact a service assistant e.g. by displaying instructions and contact information of RDC Detection customer service via a user interface.

In another implementation if the user selects an account from the presented list for depositing funds the third party agent may proceed to process the deposit request as further illustrated . After receiving a notice of soft posting from the RDC Detection platform the third party agent may send a deposit notification to the user e.g. via emails text messages or displaying a deposit receipt on a user interface.

If it a check is presented for deposit the third party agent may inspect the check to verify the check is qualified . For example in one implementation a service representative at the RDC Detection participating store may manually inspect the presented paper check to see whether it is a proper check and whether it has been endorsed. For another example the user may insert and scan the check at the check deposit facility equipped at the RDC Detection participating store and the RDC Detection may perform an initial optical character recognition OCR upon the captured check image to inspect check formalities. If the check is qualified for deposit the third party agent may proceed with process the check for deposit . Otherwise the third party agent may return the check to the user and inform the user of the ineligibility of the check and suggest the user mail the check to a RDC Detection enabled bank branch for deposit .

In one implementation the check processing may include courtesy amount recognition CAR and or legal amount recognition LAR . For example in one implementation the third party agent may capture images of the paper check for OCR and extract deposit information from the check images. The RDC Detection may compare the extract deposit amount from the check image and an amount entered by the user to confirm consistency as further illustrated in . In an alternative implementation the RDC Detection may perform intelligent character recognition ICR to recognize CAR LAR amount to inspect the quality of the check image.

In one implementation the third party agent may inquire the user for additional deposit requests until the agent ends the deposit service.

In one implementation the third party agent may determine whether the generated check images are eligible for further processing. In one implementation a service representative may view the check image on screen to determine whether the image is disoriented blurred or skewed. In another implementation the third party agent may send the check images to the RDC Detection platform where an initial OCR may be performed on the check image to inspect whether the check is readable. If the check image fails to pass the initial formality inspection the third party agent may receive an error message and the user may be directed to customer service with returned check for further assistance in RDC Detection service. In one implementation the user may cancel the deposit and close the transaction.

When the third party agent determines the check image is eligible for deposit processing a deposit request may be forwarded to the RDC Detection platform . For example in one implementation a data package including the captured check images and user entered check metadata such as a deposit amount a selected deposit account and or the like may be send to the RDC Detection platform. In one implementation the RDC Detection platform may conduct duplicate detection as discussed in similar embodiments in . If the check is a duplicate the RDC Detection platform may reject the deposit and end the transaction. Otherwise if not the RDC Detection platform may provisionally post the deposit amount to the user s selected deposit account and send the deposit information to the clearinghouse for soft post check . For example the soft post check may be performed within similar embodiments discussed in .

In one implementation upon receiving verification of the soft post status from the clearinghouse the RDC Detection platform may forward the soft post status to direct banking e.g. the payee s bank. If the payee s bank confirms the deposit the RDC Detection platform may generate a data record of the transaction and store it in the RDC Detection database . For example in one implementation the RDC Detection platform may keep a deposit record repository for duplicate check as discussed in one implementation in .

In a further implementation the RDC Detection platform may communicate with the payee s bank to control funds availability . For example in one implementation the RDC Detection service may apply a deposit constraint to the deposit allowing an available deposit amount to be deposited based on the existing amount in the user s bank account as discussed in one implementation in .

In one implementation after the funds availability control if there remains an unauthorized deposit amount the user may be directed to customer service . If not the third party agent may void the paper check . For example the paper check may be permanently modified by a PAID stamp printed thereon. For another example the RDC Detection facility at the third party agent may destroy the paper check by an electronic MICR spray to mark the check as deposited. The voided check may then be returned to the user and the deposit transaction is closed.

In one implementation if the cash is qualified the third party agent may verify the calculated cash amount with the user to confirm the consistency in deposit amount. If the user agrees the deposit amount is correct the third party agent may send deposit information to the RDC Detection platform. For example the deposit information may include but not limited to the user s RDC Detection membership information deposit account information deposit amount and or the like. In one implementation the user may be prompted to select an available account for cash deposit in a similar way to that in check deposit as discussed in one implementation in . In another implementation if the calculated amount is inconsistent with the user specified amount the third party agent may cancel the deposit .

In one embodiment upon receiving deposit details from the third party agent the RDC Detection platform may process the deposit . For example in one implementation the RDC Detection may control the funds availability of the user selected account in a similar manner as discussed in one implementation in . If the RDC Detection platform authorizes the deposit into the user specified account the third party agent may receive a request to confirm the deposit from the RDC Detection platform and prompt the user to accept the deposit status. If the user or the third party agent does not agree with the deposit status at e.g. the deposit amount may be capped by fund availability control etc. the third party agent may cancel the deposit upon user approval.

In an alternative implementation if the user agrees with the deposit at the third party agent may print a deposit receipt for the user to conclude the transaction. In one implementation after receiving a deposit confirmation from the third party agent the cash deposit amount may be soft posted to the user s account and a notification of the soft post may be sent to the user. In a further implementation the RDC Detection platform may create a transaction record of the cash deposit which may include a time stamp of the transaction the deposit amount the deposit account and or the like.

In one implementation if the deposit notification indicates the soft post is not completed the RDC Detection platform may also generate a deposit slip for the check as presented but not deposited and store it in the RDC Detection database.

At the RDC Detection platform upon receipt of the wired funds the RDC Detection platform may retrieve a clearinghouse cash deposit report . In another implementation the RDC Detection platform may also receive the daily cash deposit report and compare it with the retrieved clearinghouse cash total to verify the wired amount . If the received wired amount is correct the RDC Detection may confirm the cash deposit . Otherwise the wire transaction may be denied and a denial notification may be sent back to the third party agent.

For example in one implementation the disqualified check image may be sent to a review queue for manual review . In one implementation the RDC Detection may prompt RDC Detection staff to open and review the queued check images via a user interface terminal. In one implementation the RDC Detection staff may make modify the check image. For example the RDC Detection staff may improve the check image by proper cropping deskewing dewarping and format changes. After enhancement an image replacement document IRD may be generated based on the check image and added to the documents to be went to the payor s bank . The RDC Detection staff may continue reviewing the check images in the queue until the queue is completed.

In another embodiment for kiosk ATM retail deposit a user may be instructed from an ATM kiosk screen to place or insert the check into a check deposit slip for scanning and or the like.

In another embodiment for mobile deposit a user operating a mobile device may access the RDC Detection website via the mobile device or may launch a RDC Detection component pre installed on the mobile device and connect to the RDC Detection platform to submit deposit requests via the RDC Detection component.

In one embodiment in response to the user request the RDC Detection platform may initialize a remote deposit component . For example in one implementation the RDC Detection may retrieve and load a user interface page for remote deposit. In one embodiment the RDC Detection may instruct the user to capture and submit an image or video streaming of the check as will be further illustrated in and B C. In one implementation the initialized remote deposit component may authenticate the user by prompting the user to login a remote deposit system with a user name and password if the user is an existing member of the RDC Detection. For example in one implementation a remote depositor may access a remote deposit service website and submit a request by clicking on a deposit button on the webpage. The RDC Detection may then lead to a login webpage prompting the depositor to login to the remote deposit service with a user name and password.

For another example for mobile deposit via a mobile device the user may launch a remote deposit application on a menu of the mobile device to send a request for mobile deposit e.g. via SMS etc. and the RDC Detection may determine whether the mobile device has been registered based on its physical address MAC address . In a further implementation the RDC Detection may instruct the user to submit biometrics information for authentication. For example if the user is operating a video camera video files and or live video streaming of the user may be transmitted to the RDC Detection to authenticate the user by face recognition procedures.

In one embodiment the RDC Detection may process the received check image or video file as will be further illustrated in . For example in one implementation the RDC Detection may process the received check image or video file to generate an enhanced digital check image in order to extract deposit information and convert the check image to an image file format in compliance of virtual check standard e.g. X9.37 cash letter image files etc. . In one embodiment the RDC Detection may extract check deposit information from the processed check image . For example in one implementation an Optical Character Recognition OCR procedure may be applied to the enhanced check image and extract information such as the amount of deposit the account number banking routing number payee s name deposit date endorsement the magnetic ink character recognition MICR line which contains information of the account number of bank routing number and or the like. In another implementation the RDC Detection may analyze any metadata and additional submitted information associated with the check image such as GPS information if image is submitted by a GPS enabled mobile device time stamp of image capture IP address of the image capture device MAC address system identifier for retail POS kiosk deposits manually entered deposit amount user identification such as account name and password and or the like.

In one implementation the RDC Detection may determine the check is a duplicate or representment as will be further illustrated in . In one implementation the RDC Detection may perform the representment inspection at a payee s bank prior to provisional deposit . In another implementation the RDC Detection may send deposit data to an external agency for representment service

In one embodiment the RDC Detection may verify the check image based on the extracted information e.g. determining whether the extracted check information is valid . For example in one implementation the extracted information from the check image may be compared with the user submitted deposit information e.g. payee s name deposit amount etc. For another example the RDC Detection may check if a proper endorsement is contained on the back side of the check image.

In one embodiment if the check is not valid the bank may reject the check image and abort check deposit . In another embodiment if the check is valid the RDC Detection may provisionally credit the indicated amount of funds into the user s amount . For example in one implementation the RDC Detection may post the deposit to the payee s bank and the payee s bank may provisionally credit the deposit amount to the payee s account.

In one embodiment the RDC Detection may perform a check clearing procedure to control fraudulent items as will be further illustrated in . For example the RDC Detection may send x9 37 cash letter check images to a regional branch of the Federal Reserve a correspondent bank a clearinghouse bank and or the like to clear the check. If the RDC Detection receives a positive result of the check clearing the deposited credit may be confirmed . Otherwise the provisionally credited funds may be deducted from the payee s account and the transaction details may be provided to the user .

In an alternative embodiment the bank may process the ACH debit entry substitute check and or electronic image. As noted above the bank may present the ACH debit entry to an ACH service provider e.g. EPN which may be responsible for settling the transaction between the payee s bank and the payer s bank. The bank also may convert the digital image into a substitute check and present the substitute check to an intermediary bank e.g. a regional branch of the Federal Reserve to complete the check clearing process. In one implementation the bank may debit the payee s account if the original check is not received and or sent within a predetermined period of time. For example the bank may require that the payee send the check and have it postmarked within five business days of sending the electronic data representative of the check. If the check is not postmarked within the predetermined period of time the financial institution may void the provisional credit e.g. withdraw funds from the account .

In one embodiment upon completion of the deposit the RDC Detection may further instruct the user to void the physical check to avoid representment. For example in one embodiment the RDC Detection may instruct the user to place the physical check to certain equipment such that a stimulus may be applied to the physical check to permanently modify the check as void . For another example if the deposit takes place at a kiosk or ATM the deposit facility may print ELECTRONICALLY PRESENTED across the front of the original check when the check is scanned by equipment designed to convert the check to an electronic image for further processing. For another example the physical check may contain a radio frequency identification RFID tag. When the RFID tag receives a particular radio signal the RFID tag may be modified as void . For further examples if the physical checks contain tags sensitive to heat the check may be voided by the heat generated by the application of a bright light source such as one that may be found in a scanner.

In another implementation the RDC Detection may void the physical check by MICR line destruction. For example the RDC Detection may punch holes on the MICR line printed on the paper check. In one implementation the punch mechanism may comprise a roller placed with the image capture device e.g. inside a scanner etc. and may be positioned to coincide with the placement to the MICR characters on the check item inserted into the scanner. The roller may comprise a spindle with several sharp protrusions e.g. conical on its sides wherein the height of the spindle may be equal to or around the height of the MICR characters. In one implementation the remote processing component running on the depositor device e.g. the depositor s computer Apple iPhone and or the like may control the roller to enable or disable it against the paper check inserted in the scanner e.g. to punch holes on the check. In one implementation when the roller is enabled by the remote processing component the roller may rotate around its central axis to progressively punch holes along the MICR line of the paper check fed into the scanner which may permanently distort or destroy the MICR characters. In a further implementation the sharp protrusions on the side of the roller may be shaped to form a specific punch character such as an X shape a shape and or the like. The design of the punch character may adopt standardized E13B fonts and or other international MICR fonts so that it will be recognized by a financial institution as a MICR destruction symbol.

For another example the RDC Detection may utilize a magnetic ink spray to chemically destroy the MICR line which may be printed using on the paper check in a magnetic ink or toner containing iron oxide. In one implementation a magnetic ink sprayer may be placed in the scanner used to capture images of the check. For example the sprayer may be included in a printer cartridge with a rectangular slit wherein the slit has the length to at least cover the height of the MICR characters. When the sprayer is enabled the magnetic ink sprays out of the slit which generates a magnetic rectangle of the height of MICR line characters. Thus when the paper check is fed into the scanner the magnetic sprayer may generate a line of magnetic rectangles to cover the original MICR characters. In a further implementation similar to the punch characters as previously discussed the split of the sprayer may be designed to form a specific magnetic character which may represent a MICR disabled character instead of being a rectangle slit and standardized E13B fonts and other international MICR fonts may be adopted.

In one embodiment the RDC Detection may allow the user to manually start the MICR destruction mechanism. For example a user may press a button to initiate the roller puncher or the magnetic sprayer after confirming a soft post status notification is received to ensure the check deposit has been processed. For another example the RDC Detection may remotely control the image capture device e.g. the scanner via the remote processing component to automatically start the MICR destruction when the check deposit has been processed. In one implementation once the MICR destruction is launched instructions programmed and stored with the MICR destruction mechanism e.g. stored in an EPROM memory of the scanner etc. may execute commands including placing the coordinates of the starting punch or spray performing the punching or spraying within the pre programmed time frame stopping the punching or spraying when the pre programmed time frame is reached. In a further implementation the length of the punching or spraying time frame may be programmable and configurable by a user via the remote processing component.

In an alternative implementation the RDC Detection may instruct the user to physically destroy the check and submit digital evidence of check detriment. For example the user may tear the check capture an image of the torn check pieces and submit the captured image to the RDC Detection for verification as shown in . For another example if the user operates a video camera the user may submit live video streaming and or a video file showing the deposited paper check being destroyed.

In one embodiment the RDC Detection may create a record of the deposited check and store the deposited check record in a repository to prevent check re presentment. For example in one implementation the RDC Detection may store an image of the check associated with extracted information such as payee s name deposit date bank name MICR information including the bank routing number and account number and or the like. In another implementation the RDC Detection may create a record of the check based on a portion of the check image which may be unique to represent the check. For example in one implementation the created check record may only include an image of the front side of a check.

The payee also may convert the check into electronic data by scanning the check using a Magnetic Ink Character Recognition MICR device. Checks typically contain MICR information e.g. routing number account number and check number on the bottom left hand corner of the check. The MICR information usually consists of characters written in a magnetic ink. The MICR information may be read electronically by passing the check through the MICR device which may translate the characters by magnetizing the ink.

As shown in at the payee may send the electronic data to a bank that is associated with an account for depositing funds. Any means for transmitting electronic data over a communications network is consistent with an embodiment. For example if the payee creates a digital image of the check the image may be sent to the bank by attaching the image to an email. If the electronic data is in the form of MICR information captured by a MICR device the device may have an output component for transmitting the electronic data to the bank over the communications network. In addition the electronic data may include information pertaining to the account for depositing funds such as the account number and or the name on the account. The account number may appear on the check itself below the signature endorsing the check. The account number and or name on the account also may appear in an email either with or without the digital image for example.

At the payee may void the check. For example the payee may write and or stamp void on the check. At the payee may send the check to the financial institution associated with the account for depositing funds. The check may be sent via a common carrier such as the United States Post Office FedEx United Parcel Service and the like. The process may then proceed to . It will appreciated that and may be performed to provide additional security features. For example by removing the check from circulation it may be less likely that the check will be deposited more than once.

At the bank may receive the electronic data representative of the check along with information pertaining to the account for depositing funds. At the bank may credit funds to the account. The credit may be a provisional credit enabling the payee to access the funds while the check is being cleared. A provisional credit may be voided if the bank determines that the transaction is erroneous and or fraudulent.

At the bank may generate an Automated Clearinghouse ACH debit entry substitute check and or electronic image. ACH transactions typically include payment instructions to debit and or credit an account. Banks often employ ACH service providers to settle ACH transactions. Examples of ACH service providers include regional branches of the Federal Reserve and the Electronic Payments Network EPN . In an embodiment a payee may receive a check in return for the sale of goods such as a used car for example. The payee may endorse the check and or send electronic data representative of the check to the payee s bank which may be referred to as the originating depository financial institution ODFI . As noted above the electronic data may be generated in any number of ways. For example the payee may use a MICR device to scan and translate the MICR information e.g. account number routing number check number etc. located on the check and transmit the data to the payee s bank along with information pertaining to the account for depositing funds. Upon receipt of the MICR information and account information the payee s bank may credit funds to the payee s account and generate an ACH debit entry to the payer s account which may be presented to the ACH service provider for processing.

The ACH service provider may process the debit entry by identifying the account and bank from which the check is drawn. The bank from which the check is drawn i.e. the payer s bank may be referred to as a receiving depository financial institution RDFI . If the payer s bank verifies the transaction the ACH service provider may settle the transaction by debiting the payer s bank and crediting the payee s bank. The payer s bank may then debit the payer s account.

A substitute check is typically a paper reproduction of an original check and may be the legal equivalent of the original check. Substitute checks were authorized under The Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act commonly known as Check 21. The Act was enacted to facilitate the check clearing process by allowing banks to transmit electronic images of checks e.g. substitute checks to other banks rather than physically sending the original paper checks. Check 21 does not require that banks use substitute checks. In fact many banks may have voluntary agreements to accept certain electronic images of checks even though the images may not qualify as substitute checks under Check 21. If a bank does not have a voluntary agreement and or refuses to accept an electronic image the financial institution is required under Check 21 to accept a substitute check in lieu of the original check.

In an embodiment a payee may receive a check as a birthday gift for example. The payee may endorse the check and or send electronic data representative of the check to the payee s bank. As noted above the electronic data may be generated in any number of ways. For example the payee may use a general purpose flatbed scanner and or digital camera to create a digital image of the front and back of the check. The payee may then attach the digital images to an email and send the digital image to the payee s bank along with information pertaining to the account for depositing funds. Upon receipt of the digital images and or account information the payee s bank may credit funds to the payee s account. If the payee s bank and the payer s bank have a voluntary agreement for accepting electronic images of checks the payee s bank may generate an electronic image of the check and or simply forward the digital images received from the payee to the payer s bank. If there is no agreement between the banks the payee s bank may convert the digital images into a substitute check and present the substitute check to the payer s bank and or a check clearing service provider e.g. a regional branch of the Federal Reserve to clear the check.

Returning to at the bank may process the ACH debit entry substitute check and or electronic image. As noted above the bank may present the ACH debit entry to an ACH service provider e.g. EPN which may be responsible for settling the transaction between the payee s bank and the payer s bank. The bank also may convert the digital image into a substitute check and present the substitute check to an intermediary bank e.g. a regional branch of the Federal Reserve to complete the check clearing process. At the bank may debit the payee s account if the original check is not received and or sent within a predetermined period of time. For example the bank may require that the payee send the check and have it postmarked within five business days of sending the electronic data representative of the check. If the check is not postmarked within the predetermined period of time the financial institution may void the provisional credit e.g. withdraw funds from the account . At the financial institution may receive the check from the payee. It will appreciated that and may be performed to provide additional security features by removing the check from circulation.

At the payee may convey the check information and or information pertaining to the account for depositing funds. For example the payee may convey the MICR information e.g. account number routing number check number etc. on the check. In addition the payee may convey the account number of the account where the funds are to be deposited. Any method of conveying the information is consistent with an embodiment. For example as noted above the payee may use a phone email instant messaging and or fax machine. At the payee may void the check and or send the check to the bank. The process may then proceed to .

It will be appreciated that may be performed to provide additional security features. For example by removing the check from circulation it may be less likely that the check will be willfully or accidentally deposited more than once. In addition by requiring the payee to produce the check the financial institution may prevent the deposit of fraudulent checks.

At the bank may receive the check information and account information. At the bank may credit funds to the account. As noted above the credit may be a provisional credit enabling the payee to access the funds while the transaction is being processed. At the bank may void the provisional credit if the original check is not sent and or received within a predetermined period of time. At the bank may receive the check. At the bank may generate an ACH debit entry substitute check and or electronic image. At the bank may process the ACH debit entry substitute check and or electronic image. It will appreciated that and may be performed to provide additional security features.

Other security features may be consistent with an embodiment. For example the bank may only permit certain payees to remotely deposit checks. By way of example and not limitation the bank may accept electronic data representative of a check and or accept a request to deposit a check if the payee s account is in good standing. The payee s account may be considered in good standing if the payee has a positive account balance has a predetermined amount of funds in the account and or is not delinquent on any payments to the bank. The bank also may receive the electronic data and or request but credit funds to the account if the account is in good standing as of the time the electronic data and or request was received. In addition the bank may impose additional requirements on a payee remotely depositing a check into an account that is not in good standing. For example as noted above the bank may provisionally credit the payee s account upon receipt of the electronic data and or request but may require the payee to send the check to the bank. Thus the account may be debited if the check is not sent and or received within a predetermined amount of time.

In some embodiments the RDC Detection may impose limitations on the deposit amount and or the availability of the deposit. For example the RDC Detection may place a daily weekly and or other periodic limit for the total amount of remote deposits for a given period. The RDC Detection may additionally or alternatively limit the number of periodic transactions for a given user. Depending on the implementation such limits may be pre specified for users such as a default of limiting users to 3 remote deposits per day and limiting total daily deposits to 10 000 and or determined based on risks associated with a use and or a transaction. For example a user may have a pre specified deposit limit of 10 000 per day but if the user requests and or attempts to deposit an amount greater than that e.g. a check for 15 000 rather than simply rejecting the deposit the RDC Detection may notify the user that the amount is greater than there specified deposit limit. In some such embodiments the RDC Detection may allow the user to request that the deposit limit be raised for this transaction in some embodiments for an associated fee and the RDC Detection may notify a pre specified bank or financial institution administrator to approve or reject the request.

In some embodiments the RDC Detection may include user and or transaction information in the notification to assist the administrator in making the decision such information including the location of the user requesting the deposit the bank on which the deposited information is drawn the amount of time the user has been associated with the institution prior deposit banking history etc. The RDC Detection may additionally or alternatively limit the availability of some or all of the funds of deposit s that exceed the pre specified amount.

Similarly the RDC Detection may limit the availability of deposited funds according to similar defaults and or determinations. For example if the user is depositing funds from a location e.g. as determined by GPS metadata associated with a deposit from a mobile device that is outside the user s normal geographic region e.g. the user s mailing address and surrounding area the amount of funds made immediately available may be less than if the user is making the deposit from his or her home. Similarly the amount of the deposit the account s to which the deposit is applied user account balance s user tenure with the financial institution and or other information may be utilized by the RDC Detection in determining the amount s and timeline for availability.

In one implementation the RDC Detection utilizes a risk matrix with various weighted risk factors corresponding to risk information to determine account limitations. In another implementation the RDC Detection may utilize risk information in a risk calculation in which each piece of risk information is assigned a value and the amount available is determined based on the total risk value of the collected information. For example a deposit of over 5000 may have a higher risk value than a smaller deposit amount and as such may have more restrictions on availability of the full amount. Similarly a deposit by a user that had been with a bank for 10 years may be determined to have a lower risk value than a user who had just become a member of the bank. In some implementations the amounts available and or the deposit limits may be determined by the RDC Detection utilizing determined risk scores and thresholds such that a user who is determined to have a very low risk value has very few limitations imposed on his or her account a user that has a determined risk value that exceeds a first threshold but is less than a second threshold may have moderate restrictions associated with his or her account and a user that has a determined risk value that exceeds the second threshold may have even more restrictions applied to his or her account. In some embodiments the RDC Detection may utilize local and or national regulations in determining and or applying limitations to accounts and or deposits.

In some embodiments the RDC Detection may include user and or transaction information in the notification to assist the administrator in making the decision such information including the location of the user requesting the deposit the bank on which the deposited information is drawn the amount of time the user has been associated with the institution prior deposit banking history etc. The RDC Detection may additionally or alternatively limit the availability of some or all of the funds of deposit s that exceed the pre specified amount.

Similarly the RDC Detection may limit the availability of deposited funds according to similar defaults and or determinations. For example if the user is depositing funds from a location e.g. as determined by GPS metadata associated with a deposit from a mobile device that is outside the user s normal geographic region e.g. the user s mailing address and surrounding area the amount of funds made immediately available may be less than if the user is making the deposit from his or her home. Similarly the amount of the deposit the account s to which the deposit is applied user account balance s user tenure with the financial institution and or other information may be utilized by the RDC Detection in determining the amount s and timeline for availability.

In one implementation the RDC Detection utilizes a risk matrix with various weighted risk factors corresponding to risk information to determine account limitations. In another implementation the RDC Detection may utilize risk information in a risk calculation in which each piece of risk information is assigned a value and the amount available is determined based on the total risk value of the collected information. For example a deposit of over 5000 may have a higher risk value than a smaller deposit amount and as such may have more restrictions on availability of the full amount. Similarly a deposit by a user that had been with a bank for 10 years may be determined to have a lower risk value than a user who had just become a member of the bank. In some implementations the amounts available and or the deposit limits may be determined by the RDC Detection utilizing determined risk scores and thresholds such that a user who is determined to have a very low risk value has very few limitations imposed on his or her account a user that has a determined risk value that exceeds a first threshold but is less than a second threshold may have moderate restrictions associated with his or her account and a user that has a determined risk value that exceeds the second threshold may have even more restrictions applied to his or her account. In some embodiments the RDC Detection may utilize local and or national regulations in determining and or applying limitations to accounts and or deposits.

In one implementation if the RDC Detection determines the deposit amount has exceeded a maximum one time remote deposit amount defined by the payee s bank. If yes the RDC Detection may notify the user via a user interface and provide options for the user to proceed. For example the user may select to submit q request to raise the deposit limit cancel the remote deposit and exit or to only deposit the maximum available amount for next business day availability and send the deposit information to a closest branch for in person deposit service .

In one embodiment the RDC Detection platform may authenticate the user login and then retrieve user profile . In one implementation the user profile may record information including the user name user contact information user credit history user account information and or the like. In one implementation to assist the depositor in determining which accounts may be available for deposit the RDC Detection may determine a list of available accounts associated with the user for deposit . For example the RDC Detection may retrieve a list of user authorized accounts for remote deposits. For another example if the RDC Detection is affiliated with a payee s bank the RDC Detection may only retrieve a list of user accounts associated with the payee s bank. For another example the RDC Detection may determine that based upon the types of the accounts checking savings and investment accounts may be available for deposit of the negotiable instrument.

In an alternative implementation if an indication of deposit amount is available at for example the user has submitted an amount of deposit to RDC Detection or the account selection take place after the user has submitted a check image and the RDC Detection has processed the check image to obtain deposit data the RDC Detection may determine a list of available accounts for deposit based on the requirement of each account. For example the RDC Detection may filter accounts that have a maximum allowable deposit amount lower than the deposit amount. For another example to assist the depositor in determining which accounts may be available for deposit a financial institution may display a list of financial accounts to the depositor. In a further implementation if the RDC Detection is affiliated with a financial institution the RDC Detection may generate a list of accounts wherein the RDC Detection is granted access to the account by the account owner even if the account is at a different financial institution. For example a user may submit a remote deposit request to the RDC Detection platform at Bank A but Bank A may provide an option for the user to directly deposit the check into his her account at Bank B if Bank A is authorized by the user to access his her account at Bank B.

In one embodiment the RDC Detection may display a user interface for account selection e.g. a dropdown list a click and choose list etc. and the user may submit a selection of account . The RDC Detection may then determine whether the RDC Detection is granted permission to access the selected account . For example in one implementation as discussed above if the RDC Detection is associated with a first payee s bank but the selected account is associated with a different payee s bank then the first bank needs to be granted permission by the account owner to access the account at the different bank in order to proceed with check deposit. For another example if the RDC Detection is a remote deposit service agency then the RDC Detection may only access an account at a payee s bank only with authorization of the account owner.

In one embodiment if the permission is granted the RDC Detection may proceed to determine whether the submitted selection of accounts include more than one account and otherwise the RDC Detection may notify the user that the selected account is unavailable . In one embodiment if there are multiple accounts selected the RDC Detection may display a user interface for amount allocation the user and request the user submit amount allocations for each selected account. For example in one implementation if the user selected to deposit into both a checking account and a savings account the user may then split the deposit amount and enter the portions of amount associated with each account for deposit processing.

In one embodiment for different devices e.g. scanners digital camera mobile devices etc. certain permissions may be used in order to allow the browser component to remotely control the image capture device. For example in one implementation a user image device may require certificate authentication to allow secure remote control from the RDC Detection platform. Such certificates may be digital signatures interfacing an image capture device driver a Secure Socket Layer SSL encrypted certificate and or the like.

In one embodiment if the image capture device is a scanner the drivers of the scanner may be different for different operating environments e.g. the same scanner may use a different driver depending on whether it is being operated from an environment based on one of the WINDOWS operating systems an environment based on one of the operating systems used in APPLE computers an environment based on a version of the LINUX operating system etc. For example a Canon imageFORMULA DR 7580 Production Scanner requires a DR 7580 ISIS Twain Driver version 1.7 for Windows 2000 SP4 XP 32 bit SP3 XP 64 bit SP3 Vista 32 bit SP2 Vista 64 bit SP2 Windows 7 32 bit and Windows 7 64 bit and Canon LiDE 50 drivers for Mac OS X. In that case each driver may use different certificates and different environments may use various different environment specific technologies to allow the scanner to be controlled from a remote web server. In such cases the RDC Detection may obtain a large number of certificates and may interface with a large number of different technologies to support a large number of scanner environment combinations and or other image capture device environment in order to allow its software to control scanners for a variety of customers.

As such in one embodiment if the user image capture device is remotely controllable by the RDC Detection platform via the RDC Detection may retrieve security certificate for the corresponding image capture device and control the image capture device to obtain the check images. For example in one implementation the browser component which may be a security JavaScript running on the web browser application may create a device digital certificate to enable HTTPS on the image capture device. In one implementation the JavaScript may download a certificate from the remote RDC Detection if available to interface with the driver of the image capture device and create a public key for the certificate to be used in SSL encryption to establish an encrypted channel between the RDC Detection platform and the image capture device.

In one implementation the RDC Detection may instruct a user to place the front back sides of the check in front of the image capture device to create images of the check . For example in one implementation if a scanner connected to a computer is used the browser component running on a home computer connected to a scanner may control the home scanner to start upon user request and automatically collect the images in an appropriate format and resolution and can then upload the image for deposit. In such cases the user may place the physical check in the scanner bed and to click start on the browser interface. In one implementation the browser component may instruct the user to flip the physical check and repeat the process for both sides of the check via a web page interface in order to obtain images of the front and the back.

For another example in one implementation a mobile device such as an Apple iPhone may initiate a pre installed program or download and install a software package instantly from the RDC Detection platform which may facilitate the RDC Detection controlling the mobile device e.g. the iPhone to obtain and upload check images. In such cases a user may position the mobile device and take pictures or videos of both sides of the check as illustrated in . In a further implementation if the mobile device is an Apple iPhone the RDC Detection may further instruct the user to configure the system settings of the built in camera to obtain images in compliance with quality standards such as grayscale requirement resolution requirement image file size requirement and or the like.

For another example in one implementation for kiosk ATM deposit a user may be instructed from the screen of a kiosk ATM machine to place or insert the check into a check deposit slip for scanning and or the like.

In one implementation the RDC Detection may also instruct the user to enter an amount of the check to be deposited. For example in one implementation the user may enter a deposit amount on a RDC Detection website on a kiosk ATM machine or send an amount number to the RDC Detection platform from a mobile device and or the like.

In an alternative implementation the RDC Detection may implement an atomic deposit without requesting the user to input deposit information in addition to the check image submission. In this case the user device e.g. the mobile device the home scanner etc. may be decoupled from the transaction once the submission of the digital image file for deposit of the check is made. The transaction is thereafter managed by the RDC Detection platform. In this manner incomplete transactions are avoided by moving the transaction processing to the RDC Detection platform side at a financial institution e.g. payee s bank etc. after the user submits the digital image file. Any loss or severing of a communications connection between the user computing device and the RDC Detection platform such as due to browser navigation away from the RDC Detection web page communication failures user logouts etc. on the user side will not affect the processing and the deposit of the check in the digital image file. Thus the transaction will not be left in an orphaned state.

In another embodiment if the image capture device is not controllable by the browser application component the RDC Detection may load an instruction user interface page and instruct the user manually upload the check images. For example in one implementation the RDC Detection platform may not have certificates for scanner drivers for a Macintosh computer. In one implementation the RDC Detection may instruct the user to enter a deposit amount as illustrated in a schematic user interface shown in and to scan front back side of the check and save the scanned image files . In one implementation the RDC Detection may instruct the user to save the scanned image files in a specified format e.g. tiff JPEG etc. as illustrated in the schematic user interface and of . In one implementation the RDC Detection may instruct the user to edit the check image file prior to uploading . For example in one implementation as shown in the RDC Detection may instruct the user to crop the check image via an image editing component during which the user may submit a selection of check image corner via a user interface. In a further implementation the RDC Detection may instruct the user to convert the obtained check image into a grayscale image prior to uploading the image file. In one implementation the user may send the obtained check images to RDC Detection platform via email mobile MMS RDC Detection browser uploading and or the like.

In one embodiment the RDC Detection may receive check digital files from the remote user device. In one implementation the user may send the obtained check images to RDC Detection platform via email mobile MMS RDC Detection browser uploading and or the like. In one embodiment if the user image capture device is video enabled the RDC Detection may receive video clips of the check. In one implementation video files may be saved in a series of compliant formats e.g. AVI MPEG4 RM DIVX etc. and submitted to the RDC Detection platform in similar manners with those of submitting check image files as discussed above. In one implementation the RDC Detection may instruct or assist the user to compress one or more video files into a package e.g. WinZip package etc. and submit the pack to the RDC Detection.

Within various embodiments Markings or other features may be incorporated into the check sleeve to assist in orienting an image of the check to the proper angle or in distinguishing portions of the image that represent the check from non check portions. For example horizontal and vertical lines may be printed on the check whose position on an image can be detected allow the skew angle of the image to be determined and offset. Also the background of the sleeve may be printed in a color or opacity that is expected to contrast with the checks that are to be placed in the sleeve thereby providing contrast that can be used to distinguish check portions of the image from non check portions. Additionally one or more barcodes can be printed on the sleeve that can encode information such as the type of sleeve the account number to which the checks are to be deposited or a digital signature.

In further embodiments a sleeve can be constructed that holds a plurality of checks e.g. two or more checks thereby allowing plural checks to be deposited at the same time.

As shown in a check holder may take a form similar to a foldable self locking stand which may be made of flexible and bendable material such as plastic paper and or the like and may have mechanisms to hold one or more checks in place in one or more designated spaces. In one embodiment the check holder may have a front side on which the check to be scanned or taken a picture of will be placed. To reduce reflection the front side of the check may provide dark background in contrast to the color of the paper check. The front side may be made of light absorbing materials to reduce reflection. In one implementation the front side may comprise a rectangular area with printed information place the check here to instruct the user to place the check. In another implementation instructions of how to position the check may be included e.g. the user may be instructed to place the check in a horizontal or vertical position.

In another implementation the front side of the check holder may comprise printed information with regard to instructions of remote deposit such as instructions as to how to initiate the remote deposit capture application download an application package from a remote server place the paper check in the check holder capture an image of the check holder containing the check and send the captured image to the remote server using the downloaded application package. In another implementation the frond side of the check holder may comprise an institution trademark logo and promotion information for the RDC Detection.

In a further implementation to facilitate the remote deposit the check holder may be customized for an individual depositor. For example in one implementation the front side of the check holder may comprise a barcode printed thereon which includes information with regard to the depositor such as but not limited to depositor name depositor account number depositor bank routing number and or the like. In a further implementation a user may capture an image of the check placed on the check holder creating a visualization of the check associated with the barcode so that the RDC Detection may process the received image and obtain depositor information from the barcode. In another implementation other information may be printed on the front side of the check holder such as but not limited to the depositor s RDC Detection membership name the payee s bank name and or the like.

For another example the barcode may be a code that enables a given financial institution to recognize its own check holder and verify that the customer is using a holder provided by that particular financial institution as opposed to a holder provided by a different financial institution. In one implementation a financial institution may provide various different check holders e.g. check holders for different sized checks holders with different types of line markings holders with different luminescence properties etc. and the barcode may be used to assist the processing of the image that results from scanning checks positioned in the sleeve. For example if one check holder has particular line markings or particular luminescence properties the barcode may comprise information indicative of those properties so that the image processing techniques can be tuned for use with the particular check holder being used. As another example each customer of a financial institution can be provide with one or more check holders that are customized for that customer and the barcode may encode the customer s account number customer number or other identifying information. If the barcode encodes the customer s account number or customer number that information may be used to determine the account to which a check is to be deposited. For another example the barcode may also encode certain security techniques such as digital signatures to deter against counterfeit sleeves and or counterfeit barcodes.

Within various implementations the barcode may use a variety of formats. For example the barcode may be a line format such as a alphanumeric code or a two dimensional code such as data matrix. As another example the barcode can be used to orient the angle of an image of the check e.g. by detecting the skew of the lines or boundaries of the code and correcting for the detected angle. As another example the front side of the check holder may comprise more than one rectangular areas to place the check and there may be multiple barcodes associated therewith e.g. one barcode next to each area into which a check may be inserted.

In one embodiment the check holder may comprise a small flap extension at the bottom of the front side to hold the check be placed within the area and the small flap may hold the check at a slight angle so as to deflect glare light which may be incurred by a camera lens. In a further implementation the front side of the check may comprise a transparent layer affixed thereon so that the check may be inserted between the transparent layer and the front side of the check wherein the transparent layer may assist to hold the check within the rectangular area and to reduce reflection on the surface of the check.

In one embodiment the check holder is supported by foldable flaps on the left and the right side of the front side. The foldable flaps may be adjusted to create a steep fold angle to hold the check upright and deflect light away from the camera. In an alternative embodiment as shown in the foldable flaps may be folded to the back of the front side of the check holder so that the folded check holder may be inserted in to a mobile phone sleeve . A depositor may carry the folded check holder which is conveniently placed in his mobile phone sleeve together with the mobile phone and may capture images of a check with the check holder and the camera built in the mobile phone for remote deposit conveniently.

In one implementation the user may capture an image of the check placed on the check holder and submit the image to the RDC Detection. In one implementation the captured images may be processed to identify which portion s of the images represent the check. The process of determining which portions of the check represent the image may include image enhancement check corner detection dewarping cropping and or the like as further illustrated in .

In further implementations the RDC Detection may process the received image of the check holder comprising the check. The RDC Detection may detect the barcode on the received image and obtain information embedded in the barcode. For example a barcode reader may be adopted to obtain information encoded in the barcode such as but not limited to the depositor s name depositor account number payee s bank information etc. In one implementation upon performing OCR on the check image to extract deposit information the RDC Detection may compare the extracted deposit information with the relevant information obtained from barcode reading. If any inconsistency is detected the RDC Detection may send a notification to the user e.g. by displaying a message to the smart phone or the home computer to reject the image and request re submission of the check image.

For example for security concerns a payee s bank may provide individualized check holder for a user to engage in remote deposit service e.g. the individualized check holder may comprise a barcode with embedded information of the user s account information and the payee s bank s routing number. If the user uses the check holder attempting to capture an image of a check belonging to his spouse child friends and or the like the payee s bank may reject the remote deposit.

In an alternative implementation if the RDC Detection determines the extracted deposit information from OCR matches the barcode information the RDC Detection may proceed with processing the deposit with 315.

In one embodiment a user may submit a remote deposit request by sending a MMS message to the RDC Detection platform . In one implementation a cellular messaging application server may be equipped at the RDC Detection platform associated with a MMS identification number. For example shows an exemplary diagram of RDC Detection remote deposit via multimedia messaging service MMS within embodiments of the RDC Detection wherein the user may send a message to phone number 1111 which represents the MMS deposit service.

In one implementation upon verification at the RDC Detection platform if the user is not registered a text message may be sent to deny deposit request . Otherwise if yes the user may generate and send a remote deposit message by taking a picture of the check and attach the captured image in a MMS message . For example the MMS message may comprise an image of the front side of the check and an image of the back side of the check. In one implementation the user may enter deposit information in the MMS body such as deposit amount deposit account number and or the like.

Within various embodiments deposit via MMS may require registration with the RDC Detection platform as discussed above. For example the RDC Detection platform may verify whether the user is a qualified member for MMS deposit service. In one implementation the user may register his cellular phone number with the RDC Detection platform as a member qualified for MMS service and RDC Detection may verify whether the cellular phone number associated with a MMS message is registered. If not the RDC Detection platform may send a message back to the user indicating transaction has been denied.

In another implementation the user may include a personal identifying pin in the MMS body for verification. For example in one implementation a qualified MMS deposit user may first send a text message to RDC Detection e.g. number 1111 as in to request deposit and may receive a verification pin from the RDC Detection platform. The user may then send the MMS deposit message including the identification pin as an authorization of the deposit.

In another implementation as shown at live video streaming of a check may be captured and transmitted to the RDC Detection platform. For example a user may request to establish a real time video streaming link with the RDC Detection platform when submitting the remote deposit request. In such cases the user device and the RDC Detection platform may employ streaming video streaming software packages such as Apple Quicktime Streaming Servers Marcromedia Communication Server and or the like. In one implementation the user may create a video in a common streaming media format such as MPEG4 3GPP and or the like and upload an encrypted HTTP streaming video on the RDC Detection web server. For example in one implementation a user may employ an Apple iPhone may establish HTTP live streaming to the RDC Detection platform via Quicktime Software systems.

In one embodiment upon receiving the MMS message from a user mobile phone the RDC Detection system may process the check image attached in the MMS message to extract deposit information such as discussed at . For example the check image may be enhanced deskewed dewarpped and cropped to generate a Check 21 image as further illustrated in .

In one embodiment if a video file is received or live video streaming is detected the RDC Detection may generate still check images from the video streaming . For example in one implementation the RDC Detection may utilize video screen capture software packages to generate screen frame grabs and save the grabbed image files. In one implementation software such as Apple QuickTime WM Capture CamStudio and or the like may be employed to obtain frame grabs of the check video streaming.

In one embodiment if the received digital deposit file is an image file or at least one check image file has been grabbed from the received video clip the RDC Detection may determine whether the check image is valid . In one implementation the RDC Detection may determine the usability and quality of the check image. For example in one implementation the RDC Detection may check whether the check image is in compliance with the image format requirement the resolution requirement e.g. at least 200 dpi and or the like.

In a further implementation the RDC Detection may perform an Optical Character Recognition OCR procedure on the generated check image to determine whether the characters on the check image is legible and or whether an endorsement is contained on the back side image of the check. Depending upon the standards imposed by the Check 21 Act and the payee s bank s own internal image standards the verification of the digital image may vary. For example the Check 21 Act may require that the image be of a certain image quality. Although there are several ways in which image quality may be determined one manner in which it may be done is to perform an OCR operation on the check to determine if at least a portion of the information in the image is determinable. The bank may first attempt to extract and recognize characters within the digital image. Any extracted characters may then be compared to previously known information or information submitted by the account owner in the deposit request. For example the bank may attempt to find and OCR the MICR line at the bottom of the digital image. If the MICR line is unreadable or the characters identified do not correspond to known and verifiable information the bank may reject the image.

In one implementation if the check image fails to meet the system requirements the RDC Detection may send a request to the user for resubmission of a check image . In another implementation if the check image is determined to be valid the RDC Detection may proceed to process the check deposit image including large image file compression image quantumization and enhanced edge corner detection and dewarping cropping the check image for presentment as will be further illustrated in . For example in one implementation the RDC Detection may compress the image file in order to save storage space e.g. 2 megabytes per image .

In one embodiment the RDC Detection may convert the processed check image for presentment and deposit . For example in one implementation the RDC Detection may save the check image in compliance with the requirements of the payee s bank for substitute checks such as a Check 21 X9.37 cash letter file and or the like.

As shown in the RDC Detection may determine whether the check image is a grayscale image . If not the RDC Detection may convert the color image into a grayscale check image . For example in one implementation the RDC Detection may turn the luminance value of every pixel of the color check image into a grayscale pixel luminance value and a C implementation may take a form similar to 

In one embodiment the RDC Detection may determine and divide the check image into a number of tiles sub images . For example a sub image may be parsed from the original check image at pixel with a width of 100 pixels and height of 50 pixels. In one implementation the number of tiles subimages may be pre determined by a system operator as a constant. In another implementation the number may be determined by a formula in proportion to the size of the image. In one embodiment for each tile sub image a histogram may be generated . shows an example histogram chart wherein the X axis denotes the gray value and the Y axis denotes the number of counts of gray.

In one embodiment grayscale threshold values for each histogram may be determined using a variety of algorithm such as but not limited to statistical analysis as will be further illustrated in minimum fuzziness algorithm as will be further illustrated in Otsu algorithm and or the like. In one embodiment grayscale threshold values may be determined by image binarization are then determined using statistical analysis of the histogram . In one embodiment the grayscale check image may be quantumized based the determined threshold values for each tile sub image. For example in one implementation the background of the check in a relatively dark color may be converted to black. For another example the grayscale check image may be binarized into black and white only i.e. if the gray value of a pixel is greater than the determined threshold value it is determined as white otherwise it is determined as black .

In one embodiment the RDC Detection may apply image filters to the quantumized image to generate a virtual image for corner detection. For example in one implementation each tiled image may be blurred by convolving the tiled grayscale thresholded image with an array of ones which causes dilation effect to the image whereby the dilation array may be a square matrix of ones of size 3 3 or 5 5 depending on the virtual image size.

In an alternative implementation a convolution filter matrix may be applied which is designed to sharpen and enhance edges of the quantumized check image. For example in one implementation the RDC Detection may employ a Java Advanced Image JAI package for one implementation of applying a sample edge enhancing convolution filter matrix which may take a form similar to 

In alternative embodiment a black and white virtual image may be obtained via a 3 3 kernel which may take a form similar to the following 

In one embodiment upon generating the virtual image the RDC Detection may recombine the quantumized and enhanced tiles subimages into a single check image and then proceed to detect edges corners of the check image as will be further illustrated in based on the enhanced image.

In one implementation first high may be located by going from left to right on the histogram and comparing the number of counts Y of each indexed value X to the previous value until the reaching a right X limit. This may be started with a maximum value number of gray level counts being the gray level count Y at point 0 0 of the histogram. The right X limit going from left to right is set to a mode value unless the second high X value is less than the mode value. In that case the right traversing limit becomes second high . The first high gray index X value is then obtained . For discrete distributions in one implementation the mode is the value with the greatest frequency and for continuous distributions it is the point where the probability density is at a maximum. It is possible for a distribution to have two or more modes.

In one embodiment the lowest Y value traversing from left to right on the histogram may be located denoted as first min . Also the lowest Y value traversing from right to left on the histogram may be located denoted as second min . In one implementation the procedures for locating first min and second min may be similar with that of finding first high and second high on the histogram within the interval bounded by first high and the mode value. The resulting point found is denoted as first min . In one implementation first min may be set to 0 by default. If nothing is found the index gray value is at point 0 0 or the gray value count for gray value zero black . In one implementation the RDC Detection may then locate second min by traversing from right to left on the histogram within the interval bounded by first min and second high. The resulting minimum value located is denoted as second min. 

In one embodiment first min and second min may be adjusted in special cases. In one implementation if first min and second min are the same then the RDC Detection may check whether second min is greater than a boundary value B1 wherein boundary values B1 and B2 are defined such that B1 is the upper bound of gray value encompassing significant magnitudes of order in gray value counts and B2 is the lower bound of the gray value on the histogram such that magnitudes of order in gray value counts converge to sufficiently small count value or zero from the histogram. For example in one implementation the image boundaries may be 0 and 255 if there exists a full gray value usage for a given image. In one implementation if the second min is greater than B1 then second min is reset to be the resulting value of second min minus the standard deviation times a scaling factor k e.g. a suggested scaling factor in such cases is k 0.3. In that case the adjusted second min would be second min standard deviation 0.3 the first min may then be set to B1.

In another implementation if the determined first min as of is greater than zero but the determined second min as of returns empty or by default is 0 then the second min may be reset to be first min subtracted by the standard deviation multiplied by a scaling constant k. In this case a suggested scaling constant is k 1.

For example in one implementation a Java implementation of the algorithm of locating first min second min on a given histogram by statistical analysis may take a form similar to 

In one embodiment threshold values may then be determined using the determined and adjusted first min and second min as lower and upper bounds . In one implementation an image processing clamp method may be adopted which requires input parameters such as the boundary gray level values first min and second min and returns the threshold value. For example in one implementation a Java implementation of a clamp function may take a form similar to 

In one embodiment the RDC Detection may determine the position with a minimum value of the calculated fuzziness measure and then define the grayscale threshold as the gray value corresponding to the minimum fuzziness position as shown in .

In one embodiment if the grayscale check image has vague corners or edges the enhanced quantumized image may contain reflection at the edge corners as shown in of . In one embodiment a reflection detection algorithm may be implemented to avoid false corner detection.

In one embodiment grayscale bin values N1 and N2 may be determined based on a predetermined bin count limit L satisfying i N1 and N2 are greater than or equal to the corresponding gray value of the bin count limit L ii N1 is less than the minimum fuzziness threshold T of the histogram and iii N2 is greater than the minimum fuzziness threshold T of the histogram. shows an example of determining N1 and N2 on a given histogram in one embodiment of the RDC Detection.

In one embodiment the RDC Detection may determine a minimum bin count value M and an average bin count value AVG within the histogram window defined by the range N1 1 N2 1 as illustrated by the red circle in . The RDC Detection may then proceed to calculate a reflection score of the histogram . For example in one implementation the reflection score may be calculated based on the following formula Score AVG M AVG M where the score is normalized to 0 1 .

In one embodiment if the calculated reflection score is less than a predetermined minimum score P e.g. P 0.4 then it may indicate a corner sub image without reflection. The RDC Detection may proceed to implement corner detection algorithm of the quadrant . In one implementation the corner detection may be performed on the generated virtual image of the check. For example a JAI application of corner detection may take a form similar to the following 

Within implementations the RDC Detection may detect edges of the check on the virtual image both inwardly and outwardly and when the inward and outward edge detection for a given spot matches the detected spot may be considered as a successfully detected point on the edge of the check image as further illustrated in .

In one embodiment if the reflection score is less than P then the corner sub image is considered to be with reflection and the corner detection implementation may be skipped to avoid a false or misleading corner. In this case the determined corners may be less than four. In one embodiment the RDC Detection may determine whether the determined corners are sufficient to project all four corners by symmetry . For example in one implementation if there are three corners with tolerable reflection levels and one corner with reflection or two diagonal corners without reflections then the position s of the corner s with reflection may be determined by symmetric projection . In another implementation if there is only one corner with tolerable reflection or two corners with tolerable reflection on a horizontal vertical line the RDC Detection may determine that there is not sufficient information to project all four corners. In that case the RDC Detection may implement corner detection algorithm of a quadrant with reflection e.g. a corner with relatively higher reflection score and provide additional information to determine all four corners of the check image .

Within alternative implementations the corner edges detection may also be applied to check images with other anomalies. For example in addition to reflections a check image may be captured under undesirable lighting conditions e.g. with poor room light with a dark background etc. interfered by reflective objects e.g. a coffee cup placed close to the check etc. with other objects e.g. miscellaneous items placed around the check etc. resulting in an image with shadows. In one implementation the RDC Detection may apply corner detection to remove such anomalies based on similar scoring procedure described in .

In one embodiment a received check image may contain a skewed distorted or warped image of a check. In such cases the check image needs to be dewarped prior to information extraction. For example skew is the difference in rotation off an axis between a feature in the digital image and the same feature in the physical embodiment of the digital image. The determination of skew of digital images captured using handheld digital cameras typically are computed in 3 dimensions. For exemplary purposes only the following deskew process uses an x and y axis though it should be understood that the principles and methods for determining skew in three 3 dimensions use the same principles and are considered to be incorporated into the present subject matter.

In another embodiment the digital image may be distorted to a degree so that the shape of the check image is not rectangular but rather trapezoidal as shown in the figure. The image may be distorted in other manners and thus the present subject matter is not limited to a trapezoidal distortion. It should be appreciated that an image may be distorted in ways other than the non limiting and exemplary trapezoidal distortion. The present disclosure is not limited to any one type of distortion.

For example in one implementation check has sides and corners . The check image may have a trapezoidal shape instead of a rectangle as sides and do not parallel parallel sides and do not have equal lengths be equal in length and the inner angles and are not 90 degrees. In such cases the RDC Detection may process the skewed image to recover the check image in a rectangular shape.

Within embodiments the deskewing dewarping process may be implemented for each quadrant of the check image. In an alternative embodiment the RDC Detection may perform dewarping deskewing after recombining the quadrants to generate an enhanced black and white virtual image .

In one implementation based on the detected four corners of the check image the RDC Detection may determine whether the check image is skewed warped or distorted . For example in one implementation the slope of a line between two corners may be used to determine the amount of distortion. If the line is strictly horizontal or vertical then the image is considered to be without distortion. Otherwise the image may be modified to remove the distortion.

In one implementation the RDC Detection may adjust skewed angles of the virtual image . For example to deskew the image the RDC Detection may determine the angle s of one or more reference line s within the check image. In one implementation the angle of the line or lines may be determined using a coordinate system as a reference. For example the angle of the line may be determined in reference to a set of horizontal and vertical axes established within the check image as shown in . The image may then be digitally rotated towards the direction that the check image may be horizontally positioned e.g. the angle may be zero.

In one implementation the RDC Detection may use reference points in the check to facilitate the proper rotation of the image. In one implementation a check may have several horizontal lines near the bottom of the check used by the check writer to sign the check and to note the use of the check. In such cases the RDC Detection may rely on the two long edges of the digital image and or the printed lines within the check as reference points lines. If the image is rotated so that the long lines and or the lines within the check are horizontal e.g. the angle between the reference line and the established horizontal axis is zero then the check image may be properly deskewed. In one implementation after the deskewing procedure the RDC Detection may then perform a test OCR to determine whether proper deposit information printed on the check may be extracted recognized and verified based on the check image.

In an alternative implementation the RDC Detection may take sample points from the check image to perform deskewing. For example four points at the upper edge and four points at the lower edge may be sampled an angle between the line connecting an upper and or lower corner point and the sampled point may be calculated to evaluate the level of skew and the check image within the detected edges may be rotated at the smallest angle to horizontalize the check image.

In one implementation after adjusting the skewed angle of the check image the RDC Detection may refine the corners edges by repeating the corner detection procedure.

In one implementation the RDC Detection may dewarp the image . For example the RDC Detection may stretch or flatten the check image if it is not in a rectangular shape based on the detected corner points. In one implementation the RDC Detection may implement techniques such as spatial transformation also known as image warping and or the like based on the determined four corners of the check image to remove distortion and skew. For example a Java implementation using the JAI packages of dewarping a check image may take a form similar to 

The RDC Detection may then crop the check image in a rectangular shape and return the cropped image for further deposit processing .

In one embodiment the RDC PLATFOR may apply edge refinement based on the sample points. In one implementation the RDC Detection may take the X mode e.g. finding the most recurrent X coordinate value of the vertical top left samples vertical top right samples vertical bottom left samples vertical bottom right samples and the Y Mode to find the most recurrent Y coordinate value the horizontal top left horizontal top right horizontal bottom left horizontal bottom right samples. Differences between the X coordinate and Y coordinate values to determine whether the upper or lower edges are horizontal or the left or right edges are vertical. For example if the difference between the Y coordinate values between horizontal bottom left samples and the horizontal bottom right samples is smaller than an acceptable constraint such as but not limited to 3 pixels then the horizontal bottom edge is considered to be strictly horizontal without skew.

In one implementation false samples due to noise or other unnecessary samples may be removed. For example vertical bottom samples whose Y coordinate values exceed the Y coordinate range defined by the horizontal samples as discussed above may be discarded.

In one implementation the RDC Detection may apply similar procedures on the top samples of the horizontal top left and right and see if the difference is smaller than the minimum constraint. If yes the vertical top left and right samples that exceeds the range defined by the horizontal Top Left and Top right may be discarded. In this way the RDC Detection may eliminate points that have reflection that hugged the top and bottom edges.

In one embodiment line projections may be performed based on the sample points in a progressive manner. For example in one implementation for every 10 sample points the RDC Detection may apply least squares to project a line and for every projected line base on the 10 sample points the angle of the current line with the last projected line . For another example the RDC Detection may project the sample line based on a different number of sample points e.g. determined based on the quality of the check image and or the like. If the angle is greater than a predetermined constraint denoted by AngleMax the current line may be discarded but may be kept track in place of the newly detected line. In one embodiment the entire array of sample points may be exhausted to search for the best line which may be the last available line that is within the constraint of AngleMax.

In one implementation if the Y coordinate values of sample points for detecting a horizontal line have a maximum variance less than the minimal distance constraint e.g. 3 pixels the average Y coordinate values of these samples may be calculated as the Y coordinate value of the horizontal line applying. Similarly for vertical line projections such average line calculation may be adopted if the X coordinate values of the sample points are sufficiently close.

In an alternative implementation for projected horizontal lines a Y coordinate value may be extracted from the currently projected line and the old projected line at the same X coordinate value. If the difference in the Y coordinate values is significantly large the currently projected line may be discarded to counter noise and reflection around the check image that may not be filtered out.

After detecting projected lines the RDC Detection may locate the four corners by calculating intersections of the four lines . For example in one implementation the Kramers Rule may be applied to use determinants to calculate the intersections for each line. In one implementation the RDC Detection may keep four lines two horizontal and two vertical to calculate the corners. In alternative implementations the RDC Detection may obtain at eight lines vertical left top vertical left bottom vertical right top vertical right bottom horizontal top left horizontal top right horizontal bottom left and horizontal bottom right to locate the corners. For example the intersection of the vertical top left line and horizontal top left line may be located as the top left corner.

In one implementation the RDC Detection may determine whether an intersection is a good corner by calculating the inner angles . For example in one implementation the four inner angles may be calculated and summed up. If the sum is equal to or within a sufficiently small difference to 360 degrees the corners are considered to be good. Otherwise in one implementation the RDC Detection may assume three out of the four corners are good and may detect the bad corner .

In one implementation the RDC Detection may calculate the differences between the angles to detect the bad corner. For example if the difference between the bottom left and bottom right angles the difference between the top right and bottom right angles are sufficiently small but the difference between the top left and top right angles is greater than a maximum tolerance level e.g. AngleMax the RDC Detection may determine the top left corner is a bad corner. In such cases the RDC Detection may re calculate the top left corner by rectangular projection based on the other three corners.

In an alternative implementation the RDC Detection may utilize the projected lines to re calculate the detected bad corner . In the above example if the top left corner is detected as bad which may imply the projected vertical left top line and the horizontal top left line are not accurate then the last available vertical left bottom sample line and the last available horizontal top right sample line may be extended so that there intersection may be re calculate as the top left corner .

In one implementation in the dewarping and cropping . the virtual images may be oriented to make the bottom horizontal based on the lines from the horizontal bottom projections. In one implementation if multiple bad corners exist the RDC Detection may apply a large median filter to the virtual image to remove noise and reapply the line projection to refine corners .

In another example the RDC Detection may implement detection algorithm such as the Moravec corner detection algorithm the multi scale Harris operator the Shi and Tomasi corner detection algorithm the level curve curvature approach LoG DoG and DoH feature detection the Wang and Brady corner detection algorithm the SUSAN corner detector the Trajkovic and Hedley corner detector the FAST feature detector automatic synthesis of point detectors with Genetic Programming affine adapted interest point operators and or the like . . . .

Within various embodiments upon receiving a deposit request from a user the RDC Detection platform may deliver a remote deposit processing component to the user device as discussed in A and B. In a further implementation the user may select to submit identification information for the deposit via the camera. For example the RDC Detection platform may receive and process biometrics data from the user e.g. a payee may be instructed to submit an image or video clip of himself by posing his face in front of the web camera or the cellular phone camera. In one implementation the remote deposit processing component running on the user s device may provide a user interface which instructs the user to position his face within a specified area in order to produce a quality front side view.

In one implementation the RDC Detection platform may take a snap picture of the video of the user to perform face recognition procedures for user authentication obtaining payee information for check clearance and or the like. In one implementation in order to obtain quality images of the user the RDC Detection platform may automatically take multiple snap images from the video. If none of the obtained photos is qualified during the facial recognition for example the photo is too blurred the user submitting a profile view of his face and or the like the RDC Detection platform may request the user to re submit identifying information. In one implementation the user may select re producing facial recognition video or switch to other identifying methods such as submitting login information and or the like.

Upon identifying the user the RDC Detection platform may instruct the user to hold the check in front of the camera to produce video capture . For example the RDC Detection platform may display a message please hold your check up to your web camera via the user interface of the remote deposit application running on the user s computer and display another message you may remove the check now after a short period of time e.g. 3 seconds etc. during which the remote deposit application has captured a video clip of the check holding in front of the camera.

In one implementation the user may send the whole video clip file to the RDC Detection platform to generate snap images from the video clips . In an alternative implementation as a video file is usually large to achieve efficiency the remote processing component may generate images from the video clip . For example in one implementation the RDC Detection system may utilize video screen capture software packages to generate screen frame grabs and save the grabbed image files. In one implementation software such as Apple QuickTime WM Capture CamStudio and or the like may be employed to obtain frame grabs of the check video streaming.

In another implementation the remote deposit application at the user s computer may automatically take consecutive snap pictures of the check when the user holds the check in front of the camera. For example the user may be requested to hold the check in position for 3 seconds during which the remote deposit application may capture snap pictures every 100 ms to generate 30 frames of the check and submit the images to the RDC Detection platform.

In one implementation the RDC Detection system may determine whether the snapped images are usable . For example the resolution and file format of the check images may be checked. For another example the RDC Detection system may perform an initial OCR on the images to examine whether the texts in the image are legible. If the RDC Detection system obtains multiple images of the check then the image with the best quality may be used to optimize performance. For example the RDC Detection system may select the image with the highest solution with the least corner reflection as discussed in with the least skewness or distortion as discussed in and or the like. In one embodiment if none of the images is qualified the RDC Detection may request the user to re produce check images via the camera at . In one implementation the user device may transmit the grabbed frames of check to the RDC Detection platform in real time so that the RDC Detection may examine the received images in real time to select an optimal shot and or notify the user whether re capture is required due to poor image quality.

In one embodiment upon obtaining check images the RDC Detection system may proceed to extract deposit information and complete the deposit. The RDC Detection may further utilize the user camera for check destruction. In one implementation the RDC Detection may request the user to destroy the physical check after successful deposit. For example in one implementation the RDC Detection system may display a message Please tear the check to your camera. The user may then submit a video clip of tearing the check while the deposit application may take snap shots. In one implementation the RDC Detection system may verify validity of the check destruction e.g. verifying the check shown in the received snap pictures is the same as the deposited one and then send a deposit acknowledgement message to the user to confirm the deposit .

In one implementation the RDC Detection system may implement user face recognition capturing snap pictures of the check and capturing destruction of the check in real time. In another implementation the RDC Detection system may process the video deposits in a batch. For example the RDC Detection system may request the user to submit snap shots of the check and then soft posts the fund. The RDC Detection system may then request the user to destroy the check after check clearance in batch time as discussed in .

In another embodiment if no such void check indication is found the RDC Detection may compare check identification data with the check identification data within a limited subset of previously deposited checks e.g. checks deposited to the same payee s account within the past ten months the last one hundred deposits to the same payee s account etc. For example in one implementation check identification data may comprise Check identification data is any data that identifies the financial instrument in a relatively unique fashion. For example check identification data may comprise MICR data such as payer account number payer bank routing number and check number payer information such as payer name and address the deposit amount of the check and or the like. In one implementation check image characteristics such as a combination of characteristics from a payer signature line may also be used as check identification data. In one implementation log files containing check identification data may be kept for all deposits. Transaction logs may be maintained for customer accounts or for the financial institution as a whole.

In one implementation if there is a match with any previously deposited check the RDC Detection may flag delay or terminate the deposit transaction . For example in one implementation flagging the transaction may indicate to setting a flag that will cause some further scrutiny of the transaction at a later time. The subsequent transaction analysis may automatically analyze further aspects of the check and comparing it to a suspected duplicate check or may report to a system operator e.g. bank clerks etc. . For another example the RDC Detection may delay transaction by causing the transaction to be delayed and processed at a later time. In one implementation delaying and flagging may be used together to provide adequate time for additional scrutiny required by the flag. In a further implementation the RDC Detection may terminate and abort the transaction.

In one embodiment when the transaction is flagged delayed or terminated a notification may be sent to a customer advising them of the action and optionally of the reason for the action as well. In one embodiment the customer may be notified that the check has been identified as a possible duplicate and may be instructed to provide additional check identification data such as re capturing and submission of a new check image.

In one embodiment if there is no match detected in the comparison of the RDC Detection may determine whether to enlarge the comparison range of previously deposited checks . If so the RDC Detection may enlarge the comparison range to compare check identification data within a full set of previously deposited checks . For example in one implementation the RDC Detection may further search and compare the check identification data with all the stored deposit information in the database.

In one implementation the limited subset comparison may be performed in real time and the remainder of the comparison may be conducted at a later time. For example in one implementation the RDC Detection may perform a multiple representment check within a 6 month database in real time on all RDC Detection channels and records. In another implementation the RDC Detection may call a service to handle bulk transactions at batch time and to obtain a consolidated re presentment report response as will be further illustrated in .

After a full set comparison if a match is located the RDC Detection may perform subsequent transaction analysis of the check deposit. Otherwise the check is considered to be valid and the RDC Detection may proceed to deposit funds to the payee s account.

In one embodiment the representment detection in one embodiment of the RDC Detection as shown in may be implemented in a real time manner at the RDC Detection platform and or the payee s bank prior to soft posting. In another embodiment the RDC Detection and or the payee s bank may send deposit data to a centralized warning system such as an external agency a clearinghouse bank and or the like to detect check representment. In one implementation the centralized warning system may inspect deposit data with financial institutions other than the payee s bank to identify checks that have already been presented. In a further embodiment the centralized warning system may provide representment service both in real time and at batch time and subscribe a payee s bank for check presentment notification. provides a combined logic and block diagram illustrating an example implementation of representment service at a centralized warning system in one embodiment of the RDC Detection.

In one embodiment when the RDC Detection receives a check presentment to a payee s bank the RDC Detection may process the request and send extracted deposit information and check images to a centralized warning system for presentment services . In one embodiment the presentment services may include registration service real time detection service and batch detection service . In one implementation the payee s bank may subscribe via the registration service in order to receive presentment notification published by the warning system. In one implementation attributes associated with the payee s bank may be maintained in a registration repository such as a list of the transit routing numbers the payee s bank owns callback service URL for presentment notification callback credentials and or the like. For example in one implementation when a payee s bank sent check information and check images to the centralized warning system for representment check the system may send check presentment notifications to a variety of subscribed banks .

In one embodiment the real time detection service may implement a representment search within a centralized repository of previously deposits. In one implementation the real time detection service may take a form similar to the process shown in .

In one embodiment the batch detection service may process representment detection for bulk transactions in an off line manner. For example in one implementation a payee s bank may use this service to send all remote deposit transactions at the end of each day for re presentment validation and expects a next day response. In one implementation an X9.37 image cash letter containing the remote deposit transactions may be submitted to the centralized warning system and a response report containing presentment re presentment information may be published to the payee s bank.

In one embodiment the clearinghouse bank may provide check identification service to identity a type of the check . For example in one implementation a check type identifier at the clearinghouse bank may determine whether the deposited check is s U.S. Treasury check a U.S. Postal money order a cashier s check a Federal Reserve Bank check a certified check a Federal Home Loan Bank check a teller s check a state local government check an on us check and or the like based on the received check information. In one implementation the check type identifier may inspect the MICR information on the check to determine its type. In one embodiment if the check type identifier is unable to determine the type of the check the identification service may proceed to other inspection procedures to determine whether the deposited check is a fraudulent. For example in one implementation the identification service may send alerts and present the check data to fraudulence experts.

In one embodiment the external agency or clearinghouse bank may return an indication of the check type to the payee s bank. In one implementation the payee s bank may determine whether the check is a Regulation CC compliant based on the received check deposit data and the check type indication from the clearinghouse. For example in one implementation U.S. treasury checks certified checks and or the like may be considered as Regulation CC safe and eligible for next business day availability of deposit confirmation . In another implementation if the check is not Regulation CC safe the payee s bank may inspect the payee s account to ensure ensures full funds availability in account to cover the deposited amount upon fraud and apply appropriate holds and limits on the deposit amount . The deposit may render limited fund availability from the payee s bank.

For example in one implementation a user may request to deposit a 1000.00 non Regulation CC safe check but only has 500.00 existing amount in the account. In such cases the RDC Detection may receive and verify remote deposit data from the user and the payee s bank may provisionally credit 1000.00 to the user s account. In one implementation the payee s bank may generate a substitute check and send the substitute check for clearinghouse check. In one implementation if the payee s bank receives a clearinghouse result indicating that the deposited check is not Regulation CC compliant the payee s bank RDC Detection may notify the user via a user interface to provide a variety of options of deposit e.g. display messages on the RDC Deposit website send emails instant messages to the user device and or the like. For example the user may choose to deposit the maximum allowable funds at the moment or to cancel the deposit or to provisionally post the check but mail the physical check to the bank for clearance and or the like.

In an alternative embodiment a dead check repository may be employed to store records of negotiable instruments such as checks that have been processed by a network of financial institutions. The records accessible when preparing to deposit either remotely or physically a negotiable instrument serve as an indication to a financial institution as to whether the negotiable instrument has been previously presented. Thus accessing the record before confirming the deposit secures deposits by preventing re presentment of negotiable instruments.

Alternately at the record of the check may be created by financial institution and may include forming a representation of the check from information contained on the check. The representation may be an image. For example if the electronic data representative of the check is in the form of a digital image the digital image may be used as the record of the check. Alternatively the representation may be a data string including one or more identifying characteristics of the check organized in a predefined order.

Alternate to or at if the electronic data representative of the check is a digital image of the check the record of the check may be created by financial institution and may include forming an image of one or more portions of the electronic data representative of the check. In this manner one or more portions of the check deemed to include identifying characteristics may be used as the record of the check. If more than one portion is used to create the record the portions may be subsequent portions with each portion containing one or more identifying characteristics. Or the image may comprise non subsequent portions of the check. For example the portion of the check containing the date and check number may be placed next to the portion of the check containing the signature of the payer to form the record of the check.

Other means of creating a record of the check may be employed. Furthermore financial institution may not be responsible for creating the record of the check and may instead provide by way of network for example the electronic data representative of the check to an outside source not shown or to another financial institution capable of creating the record. The outside source or other financial institution may create the record by forming a representation of the check from information contained on the check by forming an image of one or more portions of the check or by other means. The record may then be sent to financial institution through network for example.

An analysis may be performed to determine whether the record of the check created by one of financial institution or an outside source is unique or has already been created and stored in the repository. The analysis may include comparing the created record to a plurality of records stored in dead check repository.

If the record of the check has not already been stored in the repository the record may serve as an indication that the check attempted to be deposited by payee has not previously been deposited. Accordingly financial institution may proceed with the remote deposit as desired by payee. Additionally financial institution may perform actions to assist in subsequent record assessments used to determine if subsequent remote and or physical deposits may be processed.

At the unique record of the check is stored in dead check repository. At following the storing of the check in a dead check repository the remote deposit is processed. At funds associated with the check are credited to account held with financial institution. At the funds identified by the check are deducted from the account of payer for example account associated with the check.

If it is determined that the record of the check already exists in dead check repository then the remote deposit is desirably rejected and or other predetermined actions may be taken e.g. notify the payer the payee the financial institution other financial institutions . Alternatively the dead check repository may detect similarities but not an exact match between the record being verified and a record stored in dead check repository. For example one inconsistency between the record being verified and a stored record may exist while multiple portions of the record being verified may match the stored record. If such an inconsistency leads to an uncertainty in the unique record determination at financial institution may proceed depending upon predetermined rules developed by financial institution.

At financial institution upon receipt of the check obtains identifying characteristics of the check. Several identifying characteristics may include but are not limited to the signature of payer the date as indicated by payer and the account number associated with account from which the funds identified on the check will be deducted. At a digital image comprising some or all the portions of the electronic data representative of the check and or the identifying characteristics may be formed. The digital image may be a smaller sized image than the electronic data representation of the check for example.

At a record of the check in a format consistent with the format of the records stored in dead check repository is created. The creation of the record in a format consistent with the stored records may include for example forming a composite digital image comprising each digital image of each portion. Each digital image may be arranged in a predefined manner to form the composite digital image consistent with the plurality of records stored in the dead check repository.

At a confirmation process is implemented to determine if the record of the check is unique or has already been stored in the repository. As the record has been formed to be consistent with the format of the other records stored in dead check repository the confirmation process may include a direct comparison between the created record and the stored records. Optionally at the record of the check is stored with the plurality of records currently stored in the database. If the record matches a record already stored in the repository the record may be stored with the previously stored record to serve as an indication that the check associated with the record was presented for re presentment for example.

At payee is provided with a notification related to the uniqueness or verification of the negotiable instrument based on a comparison of a record created based on the negotiable instrument and previously generated records stored in a repository for example. The notification may be provided electronically though email or text message over network for example. If the notification is that the negotiable instrument is unique or does not already exist in the repository then at payee receives indication that the appropriate funds have been deposited into account owned by payee. If on the other hand the notification indicates that the negotiable instrument is not unique or already exists in the repository at payee receives an indication and e.g. a notification to visit or otherwise contact financial institution in order to attempt to deposit the negotiable instrument.

At payee may be required by for example financial institution to void the negotiable instrument. This may include sending a copy of the negotiable instrument to financial institution or to an entity as indicated by financial institution. Payee may be required to perform the void process within a predetermined period of time.

When a negotiable instrument is deposited using electronic means there may arise the situation when the physical negotiable instrument transforms to exist in essentially two forms the original physical negotiable instrument and the newly generated digital form. While the newly generated digital form may undergo processing through the federal check clearinghouse the physical form is typically left in possession of the bearer of the negotiable instrument e.g. the person that deposited the check. Although a financial institution may send instructions to the depositor to destroy or transfer possession of the physical negotiable instrument upon transmission of the digital form the financial institution may have little to no way to force the depositor to actually destroy the negotiable instrument without limiting access to the funds. Unless the depositor destroys the negotiable instrument the duality described above may continue to propagate i.e. both the physical negotiable instrument and the digital form may continue to exist contemporaneously.

Thus a financial institution may wish to cause the alteration of the physical negotiable instrument with or without the assistance of the depositor to render the physical form of the negotiable instrument non negotiable. In other words the financial institution may cause the alteration of the appearance of the physical negotiable instrument to a point that makes it difficult or impossible to present the physical negotiable instrument in another transaction thus effectively destroying the negotiable instrument with or without the participation of the depositor. For example the appearance of the negotiable instrument may be changed to show the term VOID . Thus if the negotiable instrument is presented again the term may indicate that the holder negotiable instrument has previously deposited or attempted to deposit the negotiable instrument. The negotiable instrument may be altered in other ways and is not limited to the term used above.

In one embodiment check also has unmodified modifiable section . Unmodified modifiable section may use various types of modifiable inks or other mechanisms so that when a stimulus is applied to unmodified modifiable section the ink or mechanism changes in appearance or structure to indicate a deposit process may have occurred. The change may be permanent or temporary. There are various types of ink that may be used the present disclosure not being limited to any one particular type. Some examples of modifiable inks are inks sensitive to light heat or sound. An ink that is sensitive to light may be configured to modify based upon exposure to a certain magnitude of light for a certain period of time. For example a light sensitive ink may change its appearance based upon a bright light such as a light from a scanner being applied for a long period of time. The time may be determined based upon various scan speeds of a typical scanner. For example the scan speed of a scanner at a high resolution may be slower than the scan speed of a scanner at a low resolution.

If the ink is sensitive to heat the ink may be configured to modify its appearance based upon the heat generated by the application of a bright light source such as one that may be found in a scanner. If the light source is applied for a long period of time the ink may be configured such that the heat generated by the absorption of the light by the ink will create a certain amount of heat within the ink thus causing the change in the ink. Unmodified modifiable section may also have a mechanism sensitive to other types of stimuli such as a radio frequency identification RFID tag. When the RFID tag receives a particular radio signal the RFID tag may be modified. When the RFID tag is read at a later time the modification may indicate that the deposit of the negotiable instrument may have occurred. The RFID tag may also among other uses be used to track the location of check .

In an alternative embodiment check has modified modifiable section which was unmodified modifiable section . After the application of a stimulus to unmodified modifiable section the ink or mechanism within unmodified modifiable section may be changed to show modified modifiable section . Check now shows the term VOID within modified modifiable section . The change may be used to provide information to prevent a second or subsequent presentment of check for deposit.

In an alternative embodiment an ink sensitive to various stimuli that modifies after removal of a protective cover may be employed. Check has removable coating which seals modifiable ink section from exposure to stimuli. The stimuli may be of various types including but not limited to air or light. For example prior to deposit of the negotiable instrument there may be a requirement to remove coating to indicate the underlying code which is shown as VO . Upon removal of coating ink section is exposed to light causing the ink to modify to show VO . Thus coating may be of a range of materials that blocks the exposure of section to a stimulus.

Once exposed ink section may be permanently or temporarily modified. Ink section indicia may also be encoded to increase the difficulty of defeating the void process. For example ink section may be a bar code unique to check itself and may be designed in a manner that is difficult to determine what the bar code will be. In order to deposit check coating may be removed to show the encoded indicia. If the indicia is encoded the user may be forced to remove coating because of the difficulty of determining the code without exposing the indicia by removing coating

After the deposit is processed bank may wish to prevent the use of check in another deposit operation. In one exemplary and non limiting embodiment bank may cause the modification of check to prevent a subsequent presentment of check . Bank may send a communication to account owner to void the check. The communication may be directed at scanner with or without the knowledge of account owner . In other words bank may not complete the deposit operation if account owner intercedes in the void operation. Bank may send a signal to scanner to scan a surface of check at a speed to cause the modification of an ink section on check as described above. Once the scan operation is completed bank may wait to complete the deposit operation until a communication or notice is received that check was voided. The notice may include the slow scanned image showing the 3 modification of check .

In an alternative embodiment a user receives a check from another individual for example if the user is owed money or the check is used as payment for a good or service. The user endorses the check by signing the check thus indicating the intent to deposit the check into an account. The user generates a digital image file by scanning at least one surface of the check using a scanner. The user sends the digital image file to the bank which controls the user s account. After processing the deposit request a communication is generated and transmitted to void the check. The communication may be directed to the user and or may be directed to another mechanism. For example the communication may be directed to the user s scanner with or without the knowledge of the user. The communication may contain instructions to re scan the check at a certain speed to cause the application of a stimulus to modify the check.

In an alternative embodiment the bank receives a deposit request from a user. After acknowledging the deposit request the bank then receives a digital image of the check. The digital image may be used by the bank to process the deposit request. The digital image may be used alone or in conjunction with additional information such as MICR information. After verifying the digital information the bank processes the deposit request. The verification may include but is not limited to the verification of the quality of the digital image the verification of any data retrieved from the digital image the verification of additional information received along with the digital image and or the verification that the check has not been deposited before. After the bank verifies the digital information received and processes the deposit request the bank then may transmit a void signal to void the check. As described earlier there may be various manners in which to void the check including but not limited to the application of a stimulus such as light heat or sound. Upon application of the stimulus the check is voided .

In an alternative embodiment a scanner is used to apply the stimulus. A bank receives a deposit request. The bank then receives a digital image of the check and account information. The bank verifies the information and processes the deposit request. After the deposit is in process to complete the process the bank transmits a void signal to the user s scanner. The void signal may contain instructions to rescan a surface of the check at a certain speed to cause the application of a stimulus. The ink may be modified based upon the application of a certain magnitude or brightness of light or heat may be generated by that brightness of light for a certain amount of time which may correspond to a scan speed. After the stimulus is applied the bank deposits the funds into the user s account.

The present disclosure may incorporate a check modifiable by various stimuli. In an alternative embodiment a system may use radio waves to modify a check. Check has embedded RFID tag . RFID tag is an object that is sensitive to radio signals and can be incorporated into check . RFID tag can be read and modified at various distances. Typically an RFID tag such as RFID tag has two parts an integrated circuit for storing and processing information as well as receiving instructions via radio waves and an antenna for receiving and transmitting a signal. Some RFID tags do not have the integrated circuit thus reducing cost and bulk of using an RFID tag.

The RFID tag may be programmed to initially indicate that check has not been deposited. Account owner may use scanner to deposit check into account of bank using communication pathway . After check is deposited into account bank may wish to modify RFID tag to indicate that check has been deposited. Thus when the information contained by RFID tag is subsequently read RFID tag may indicate that check has previously been deposited. Bank may cause radio transmitter to transmit a radio communication through communication connection to RFID tag of check . The radio signal may cause RFID tag to modify its information to indicate that check has been previously deposited. Communication connection may be of various types including but not limited to a wireless cellular connection or an internet connection. Additionally radio transmitter may be of various types including but not limited to a local internet access point and a cellular transceiver.

The type of scanner used may also be of various types. In an alternative embodiment a scanner designed for the deposit and voiding of checks through remote means may be employed. Deposit machine is configured to provide deposit services. Deposit machine may be an integrated machine or a system having various parts including a scanner to create a digital image of a check such as check and a stimulus generator to cause the application of a stimulus to check . Account owner initiates deposit machine to generate a digital image of check the image being transmitted to bank via communication connection for deposit into account . After the bank processes the deposit of check bank may transmit a void signal to deposit machine to initiate a void process.

The void signal may be transmitted using various communication methods including but not limited to an internet connection a telephone connection such as a wireless telephone or a facsimile transmission if deposit machine is configured to receive facsimile messages. Deposit machine may void check according to the configuration of deposit machine and or the void message received. For example deposit machine may be configured to apply an ultraviolet light in response to a void signal. Deposit machine may also be configured to rescan check and send the rescanned digital image to bank to show that the void stimulus has been applied and that check has been voided.

In one embodiment as shown in the user may type the Online ID and the PIN via the user interface. Upon authentication the RDC Detection may display a list of available accounts associated with the user and the user may select to deposit into the account Four Star Checking . As shown in upon selection the user may enter a deposit amount 3578.00. In one implementation the RDC Detection may request the user capture front of check and provide specific instructions . For example in one implementation the RDC Detection may request the user to smooth the check and place it on a dark colored well lit and non reflective surface. shows the user may place the check in front of the built in camera of the mobile device to fit in the indicated area displayed on screen. Upon taking a picture of front side of the check the RDC Detection may instruct the user to sign and capture back of the check in a similar manner .

In one embodiment as shown in the RDC Detection may present the captured images of the check both front and back sides to the user for confirmation and then process the deposit . In one implementation the RDC Detection may send a notice of successful deposit to the user showing deposit amount account number and a confirmation number.

In one embodiment as shown in if the images of the checks are not properly taken e.g. the check is misaligned and the resulting images are incomplete submission of such unusable check images may lead to error messages. In one implementation as shown in the RDC Detection may inform the user the deposit can not be performed and provide additional information such as a customer assistance phone number. In an alternative implementation the RDC Detection may request the user to re take and re submit images of the check.

In one embodiment the RDC Detection may prompt the user to login with an online ID and password . Upon successful login the RDC Detection may provide deposit account information to the user and allow the user to input a deposit amount . In one embodiment the RDC Detection may provide details for the user on digital signature verification of the website and instruct the user to scan a paper check . In one implementation the RDC Detection may remotely control a scanner connected to the personal computer of the user and let the user choose the scanner from a drop down list .

The RDC Detection component enabling access of information between nodes may be developed by employing standard development tools and languages such as but not limited to Apache components Assembly ActiveX binary executables ANSI Objective C C and or .NET database adapters CGI scripts Java JavaScript mapping tools procedural and object oriented development tools PERL PHP Python shell scripts SQL commands web application server extensions web development environments and libraries e.g. Microsoft s ActiveX Adobe AIR FLEX FLASH AJAX D HTML Dojo Java JavaScript jQuery UI MooTools Prototype script.aculo.us Simple Object Access Protocol SOAP SWFObject Yahoo User Interface and or the like WebObjects and or the like. In one embodiment the RDC Detection server employs a cryptographic server to encrypt and decrypt communications. The RDC Detection component may communicate to and or with other components in a component collection including itself and or facilities of the like. Most frequently the RDC Detection component communicates with the RDC Detection database operating systems other program components and or the like. The RDC Detection may contain communicate generate obtain and or provide program component system user and or data communications requests and or responses.

The structure and or operation of any of the RDC Detection node controller components may be combined consolidated and or distributed in any number of ways to facilitate development and or deployment. Similarly the component collection may be combined in any number of ways to facilitate deployment and or development. To accomplish this one may integrate the components into a common code base or in a facility that can dynamically load the components on demand in an integrated fashion.

The component collection may be consolidated and or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing and or development techniques. Multiple instances of any one of the program components in the program component collection may be instantiated on a single node and or across numerous nodes to improve performance through load balancing and or data processing techniques. Furthermore single instances may also be distributed across multiple controllers and or storage devices e.g. databases. All program component instances and controllers working in concert may do so through standard data processing communication techniques.

The configuration of the RDC Detection controller will depend on the context of system deployment. Factors such as but not limited to the budget capacity location and or use of the underlying hardware resources may affect deployment requirements and configuration. Regardless of if the configuration results in more consolidated and or integrated program components results in a more distributed series of program components and or results in some combination between a consolidated and distributed configuration data may be communicated obtained and or provided. Instances of components consolidated into a common code base from the program component collection may communicate obtain and or provide data. This may be accomplished through intra application data processing communication techniques such as but not limited to data referencing e.g. pointers internal messaging object instance variable communication shared memory space variable passing and or the like.

If component collection components are discrete separate and or external to one another then communicating obtaining and or providing data with and or to other component components may be accomplished through inter application data processing communication techniques such as but not limited to Application Program Interfaces API information passage distributed Component Object Model D COM Distributed Object Linking and Embedding D OLE and or the like Common Object Request Broker Architecture CORBA Jini local and remote application program interfaces JavaScript Object Notation JSON Remote Method Invocation RMI SOAP process pipes shared files and or the like. Messages sent between discrete component components for inter application communication or within memory spaces of a singular component for intra application communication may be facilitated through the creation and parsing of a grammar. A grammar may be developed by using development tools such as lex yacc XML and or the like which allow for grammar generation and parsing capabilities which in turn may form the basis of communication messages within and between components.

where Value1 is discerned as being a parameter because http is part of the grammar syntax and what follows is considered part of the post value. Similarly with such a grammar a variable Value1 may be inserted into an http post command and then sent. The grammar syntax itself may be presented as structured data that is interpreted and or otherwise used to generate the parsing mechanism e.g. a syntax description text file as processed by lex yacc etc. . Also once the parsing mechanism is generated and or instantiated it itself may process and or parse structured data such as but not limited to character e.g. tab delineated text HTML structured text streams XML and or the like structured data. In another embodiment inter application data processing protocols themselves may have integrated and or readily available parsers e.g. JSON SOAP and or like parsers that may be employed to parse e.g. communications data. Further the parsing grammar may be used beyond message parsing but may also be used to parse databases data collections data stores structured data and or the like. Again the desired configuration will depend upon the context environment and requirements of system deployment.

For example in some implementations the RDC Detection controller may be executing a PHP script implementing a Secure Sockets Layer SSL socket server via the information server which listens to incoming communications on a server port to which a client may send data e.g. data encoded in JSON format. Upon identifying an incoming communication the PHP script may read the incoming message from the client device parse the received JSON encoded text data to extract information from the JSON encoded text data into PHP script variables and store the data e.g. client identifying information etc. and or extracted information in a relational database accessible using the Structured Query Language SQL . An exemplary listing written substantially in the form of PHP SQL commands to accept JSON encoded input data from a client device via a SSL connection parse the data to extract variables and store the data to a database is provided below
