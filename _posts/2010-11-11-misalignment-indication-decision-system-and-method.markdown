title: Misalignment indication decision system and method
abstract: Systems and methods for deciding whether or not to indicate misalignment. In some examples, an analysis of parametric data relating to tests sensitive to misalignment is performed in order to determine which data is incongruous and to identify corresponding probes or socket contacts as suspected misaligned. In some examples, additionally or alternatively, a spatial analysis quantifies the placement of a set of identified suspected misaligned probes, which were identified from pass/fail test data and/or parametric test data, with respect to a contiguous or non-contiguous area on one or more wafers.

During wafer testing electrical contact is preferably made between tester channels or power supplies and the bondpads also known as pads or pins of the one or more dies AKA devices being tested by means of a probecard. The probecard is constructed with a multitude of metallic probes that are attached to a printed circuit board. The traces of the PC board are electrically connected to tester channels and power supplies while the probes often in the format of tungsten needles make temporary contact to the surface of the bondpads. The metallic probes provide a mechanical and electrical interface through which electrical signals and power supply voltages are applied to the device during testing and also pass voltage responses from the device back to the tester for evaluation. Each device on a wafer will contain multiple bondpads sometimes hundreds per die and in some cases during parallel test operations multiple devices at a time will be probed. Therefore a probecard may have as many as several thousand probes in the probe array spanning an area of several centimeters. During a sequential test operation each die is tested separately. During a parallel test operation a subset of all of the dies on a wafer or all of the dies on the wafer are tested simultaneously. Therefore depending on the testing conditions one or several passes may be made through the wafer in order to contact and to test all of the dies on the wafer. Each pass is referred to as a touchdown .

For each touchdown for each wafer during wafer testing each probe in the probe array should be aligned to fall on the correct corresponding bondpad. Note that alignment relates to any of the X dimension the Y dimension the Z dimension for probe array planarity and or rotationally so called theta dimension referring to the angular dimension .

If an alignment problem remains undetected and worsens the integrity of the electrical signals involved in testing dies on a wafer may eventually degrade to a point in which spurious failures of dies being tested appear. Additionally or alternatively an alignment problem may cause a loss in yield due to mechanical damage of die bondpads. Additionally or alternatively after probing in a misaligned condition the probecard may require special cleaning and or other maintenance for example due to having probed on the insulating layer typically surrounding the bondpads . Additionally or alternatively an alignment problem may cause a requirement for wafer s to be reprobed for example due to invalid yield loss which may necessitate special handling and may consume manufacturing capacity.

Similarly during testing of packaged devices units electrical contact is preferably made between tester channels or power supplies and the pins of a packaged device. The term pins is commonly used to refer to the external package contact point that is electrically connected to the die bondpads internal to the package. Note that each packaged device may include one or more die . A packaged device is inserted into a socket which is mounted on a loadboard. The traces of the loadboard are electrically connected to tester channels and power supplies and the loadboard also provides a rigid surface to physically support the socket. The test socket contacts make temporary contact to the surface of the pins of the packaged device. The metallic test socket contacts provide a mechanical and electrical interface through which electrical signals and power supply voltages are applied to the packaged device during testing and also pass voltage responses from the packaged device back to the tester for evaluation. Each packaged device may contain multiple pins sometimes hundreds per device . During a sequential test operation each packaged device is tested separately. During a parallel test operation a plurality of packaged devices may be tested in parallel in a plurality of sockets and the handler may perform the socketing and unsocketing of the plurality of packaged devices in parallel.

During testing each test socket contact should be aligned to fall on the correct corresponding pin. Note that alignment relates to any of the X dimension the Y dimension the Z dimension and or rotationally so called theta dimension referring to the angular dimension .

If an alignment problem remains undetected and worsens the integrity of the electrical signals involved in testing packaged devices may eventually degrade to a point in which spurious failures of packaged devices being tested appear. Additionally or alternatively an alignment problem may cause a loss in yield due to mechanical damage of pins. Additionally or alternatively after socketing unsocketing in a misaligned condition the test socket may require special cleaning and or other maintenance. Additionally or alternatively an alignment problem may cause a requirement for packaged devices to be resocketed for example due to invalid yield loss which may necessitate special handling and may consume manufacturing capacity.

Described herein are some embodiments for deciding whether or not to provide an indication of misalignment. Hereinbelow unless expressly stated otherwise the term misalignment refers to probe to pad misalignment or to socket contact to pin misalignment as appropriate.

In some of the embodiments discussed below the terms misalignment misaligned probe s misaligned socket contact s suspected misaligned probe s suspected misaligned socket contact s and variants thereof are variously used to refer to failure or suspected failure in achieving the desired relative alignment of bondpad s to probe s or package pin s to socket contact s . These terms should therefore be construed to include embodiments where the misalignment is due or the suspected misalignment may be due to incorrect positioning of bondpad s package pin s and or due or to incorrect positioning of probe s socket contact s .

Some embodiments of the invention refer to contact resistance testing but do not limit implementation of contact resistance testing. In various embodiments contact resistance measurements can refer to actual measurements of resistance or corresponding measurements of voltage or current in which resistance is implied derived from known test conditions. An ideal implementation of contact resistance testing is given in Microelectronics Reliability 47 2007 titled Measurement and Analysis of Contact Resistance in Wafer Probe Testing by D. S. Liu M. K. Shih and W. H. Huang which describes measurements made with a low resistance voltage current meter such as ADEX model AX 115A with the meter set to the 1 ohm scale giving a measurement range of 0.0 1.5 ohm with a resolution of 100 micro ohms under a measurement current of 100 mA. In the described implementation measurements are made between a clean tungsten probe and various specimen surfaces such as a sheet of copper foil providing an idealized environment for the measurements. In such an embodiment contact resistances with typical nominal values less than 1 ohm may easily be resolved. In some of the embodiments that will be described below by contrast measurement is made in situ while probing wafer bondpads or contacting packaged device leads during VLSI chip manufacturing test operations. Measurements in such embodiments could be made using digital voltage current meter resources of tester sometimes in the form of an integrated Parametric Measurement Unit PMU . However other implementations are additionally or alternatively possible depending on the embodiment. Additionally in embodiments involving in situ contact resistance measurements during manufacturing test operations there may be parasitic electrical elements in the current path that result in deviation from the ideal measurement environment described by D. S. Liu et al typically seen even under DC test conditions. For example in the path of current generated from a tester PMU current source routed through the test system fixturing to the device bondpad or external package lead there may be long runs of wire and PC board traces as well as electronic relays that add resistance to that current path segment. From the device bondpad or external package lead under bias current then flows through internal device circuitry which frequently includes one or more diodes in the current path and additional path resistance. Finally in the current s return path to the tester the current flows from the device to tester ground or power supplies again via test system fixturing that includes additional resistive elements. 2 Point resistance measurement embodiments performed by forcing a known current level into a probe or package lead while measuring the resulting voltage level are well known to those with ordinary skill in the art. A brief description may be referenced for example in the proceedings of the March 2003 Burn In and Test Socket Workshop in the presented paper A Method for Measuring and Evaluating Contact Resistance in Burn in and Test Sockets by Angelo Giaimo. The specific bias conditions of any given measurement will depend on the various factors above and will vary depending on the embodiment. For example if driving current into a given bondpad or package lead requires forward biasing a diode internal to the device under test then sufficient current must be supplied by the tester PMU to drive the diode above its turn on voltage while if no such internal diode is present for example if the bondpad or package lead being driven is used as device ground then a lower current level and voltage measurement may be applied. As may be seen in this last example within any given test program for any given device measurement conditions may be varied according to pin type. Since the resistance measurements unavoidably include not only the contact resistance but also the resistive parasitic elements in the current path described above the resulting values may be much higher than in an ideal case in some embodiments in the range of 200 ohms to 1 500 ohms. In the description below in order to facilitate the reader s interpretation of the various examples and figures disclosed below the extraneous non contact related resistive components described here have been excluded from the illustrative resistance measurement values given and idealized values of contact resistance are instead used in the figures and examples

In some embodiments an analysis of parametric data relating to tests sensitive to misalignment is performed in order to determine which data is incongruous and to identify corresponding probes or socket contacts as suspected misaligned. In some embodiments additionally or alternatively a spatial analysis quantifies the placement of a set of identified suspected misaligned probes which were identified from pass fail test data and or parametric test data with respect to a contiguous or non contiguous area on one or more wafers. These embodiments as well as additional and or alternative embodiments are described below.

It is noted that there are many styles of probecards and many types of probe technologies in use and that the embodiments described herein are not limited to any particular type of probecard or probe technology. A variety of bondpad structures also exist ranging from simple planar bondpads to bondpads processed with bumps and the embodiments described herein are not limited to any particular bondpad style. Similarly there are many types of test sockets loadboards and many types of package types and handlers and the embodiments described herein are not limited to any particular type of test socket loadboard package type or handler. A variety of forms and structures of package pins and sockets contacts also exist for example varying with package type and the embodiments described herein are not limited to any particular form structure of package pin or socket contact.

In the following detailed description numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. However it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details.

Reference in the specification to one embodiment an embodiment some embodiments another embodiment other embodiments one instance some instances one case some cases other cases or variants thereof means that a particular feature structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment s is included in at least one embodiment of the invention. Thus the appearance of the phrase one embodiment an embodiment some embodiments another embodiment other embodiments one instance some instances one case some cases other cases or variants thereof does not necessarily refer to the same embodiment s .

It should be appreciated that certain features of the invention which are for clarity described in the context of separate embodiments may also be provided in combination in a single embodiment. Conversely various features of the invention which are for brevity described in the context of a single embodiment may also be provided separately or in any suitable sub combination.

For example these terms may refer in some cases to the action and or processes of a programmable machine that manipulates and or transforms data represented as physical such as electronic quantities within the programmable machine s registers and or memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the programmable machine s memories registers or other such information storage transmission or display elements.

Referring now to the figures in more detail some embodiments of a wafer testing system are illustrated in . For simplicity s sake in the description herein a module or arrow is labeled with a number and the letter A or B when referring specifically to the module or arrow in and respectively. However a module or arrow is labeled with only a number when referring to the module in either or B and or in both . illustrates a wafer testing system A and illustrates a wafer testing system B according to various embodiments of the present invention. In the illustrated embodiments wafer testing system e.g. system A and or B is configured to test semiconductor wafers.

In the illustrated embodiments wafer testing system comprises a tester configured to test dies on a wafer a misalignment indication decision system configured to make a decision on whether or not to indicate misalignment and a prober configured to contact probes on a probecard with bondpads on a wafer for example by moving a wafer chuck on which wafer is mounted.

In various embodiments of the invention any of the modules in may be made up of any combination of software hardware and or firmware that performs the functions as described and explained herein. In some embodiments wafer testing system A and or B may include fewer more and or different modules than shown in and respectively. For example in some of these embodiments some or all of tester and misalignment indication decision system may be integrated together. In some embodiments the functionality of wafer testing system A and or B may be divided differently than illustrated among the modules illustrated in and respectively. In some embodiments wafer testing system may include additional less and or different functionality than described herein.

In the illustrated embodiments of wafer testing system A misalignment indication decision system and tester communicate with one another via a channel and tester and prober communicate with one another via a channel A. In the illustrated embodiments of wafer testing system B misalignment indication decision system communicates with tester via channel and misalignment indication decision system communicates with prober via a channel B.

In some embodiments the communication between prober and other modules of system for example with tester in via channel A or with misalignment indication decision system in via channel B may occur in some cases via any suitable channel including inter alia parallel digital communication RS 232 serial communication a Transmission Control Protocol Internet Protocol TCP IP network a GPIB bus General Purpose Interface Bus also known as a IEEE 488 or HP IB bus Hewlett Packard Instrument Bus a Universal Serial Bus USB an IEEE 1394 Interface any appropriate channel using high speed electronic communication technology etc.

In some embodiments the communication between misalignment indication decision system and tester assuming different units is via any suitable channel including inter alia a local area network such as an Ethernet connection with a network protocol e.g.TCP IP a Universal Serial Bus USB an IEEE 1394 Interface any appropriate channel using high speed electronic communication technology etc.

In the illustrated embodiments tester applies electronic test sequences to the die or dies being tested in the current touchdown also known as devices under test DUTs through a test program . Test program digitally controls tester electronics for generating physical test signals such as pin electronics cards pattern generator boards power supplies and the like to drive test signals and to provide power to all probes in the probe array on probe card . Depending on the embodiment tester may support testing of multiple dies in parallel and or testing each die sequentially.

In the illustrated embodiments specification of the test content for example the desired signal transition timing voltage or current levels pass fail criteria vector data pattern selection vector data pattern sequences test subroutine and pattern content test flow sequencing and branching etc. is made through compiled or linked files constituting test program created for example using custom tester specific programming languages and a library of application programming interface API functions. In the illustrated embodiments the test content of test program includes pass fail test s and or parametric test s . A pass fail test is a single valued test which yields a single valued result indicating whether or not the tested value is greater than or in other testing less than a given value limit. If the tested value is greater than or less than the given limit the single valued result is failure but if not then the single valued result is pass . A parametric test yields a resulting measurement that can take on any of multiple values. Depending on the implementation the resulting measurement value for a particular parametric test may be provided by analog measurement equipment as part of testing electronics or may be honed in through the performance of a plurality of single valued tests. As an example of the latter implementation a series of single valued tests may be performed in which the given value limit is repeatedly varied until determination of a range of the actual measurement value to within the desired resolution. In some embodiments parametric test s include at least one or more different parametric tests whose resulting measurement values are sensitive to misalignment between probe s on probecard and pad s on the die s in wafer which are undergoing testing. In some embodiments additionally or alternatively pass fail test s include at least one or more different pass fail tests whose results are sensitive to misalignment between probe s on probecard and pad s on die s in wafer which are undergoing testing.

In some embodiments commercially available testers used for electronic device testing operations today along with their operating systems may be adapted to become tester . As an example the Verigy HP93K tester or the Teradyne J750 tester may be considered typical of such commercially available systems.

In the illustrated embodiments tester electronics are electrically connected to the traces of probecard while the probes in the probe array of probecard for example in the format of tungsten needles make temporary contact to the surface of bondpads of one or more dies of wafer currently being tested. The probes provide a mechanical and electrical interface through which electrical signals and power supply voltages are applied to the device during testing and also pass voltage responses from the device back to the tester for evaluation for example via tester probecard signal s . Probecard may have as many as several thousand probes attached for testing which may span an area of several centimeters.

In some embodiments it is assumed that after probecard has been mounted on prober but prior to beginning wafer testing for instance a wafer sort operation optical and or electrical procedures are used to try to align the probe array of probecard in the X Y Z and or theta dimensions. For example in some of these embodiments an automated or semi automated procedure may be performed to optically align the individual probe tips to bondpads through recognition and alignment with features visible under high magnification at the surface of the wafer . Additionally or alternatively for example in some of these embodiments an automated or semi automated procedure may be performed to electrically align the individual probe tips to bondpads. For instance contact pressure may be deliberately controlled by prober overdrive setting the probe tips of the probe array of probecard in the Z dimension somewhat below the plane of the bond pad surface to ensure good contact. As the overdrive setting is increased the contact resistance will initially decrease and then level off to a nominal low contact resistance value. This relationship is well known to those familiar with the art. In some cases any of the alignment procedures can include moving individual probe s on probecard prior to mounting probecard moving the entire probecard moving chuck and or moving any other prober fixture used to hold probecard and or chuck in place. In embodiments where optical and or electrical procedures are used to try to align the probe array of probecard it is assumed that if probecard was previously constructed and adjusted properly prior to mounting on prober then at the conclusion of alignment procedures the probes should be aligned to bondpads and testing can begin.

In some embodiments each probe tip should be precisely positioned within the XY plane of the wafer surface corresponding to the location of an associated bondpad should also be positioned properly in the Z dimension such that the tips of all the probes are within the same plane when the wafer is being contacted for testing and should also be rotationally aligned. In some of these embodiments good electrical contact between probes and bondpads can only be achieved when the tips of each of these probes are positioned within a few micrometers of the centers of the associated bondpads while also being correctly positioned in the Z and theta dimensions. In some of these embodiments maintaining the correct alignment of each one of the thousands of probes involved without error or adjustment while stepping across the surface of hundreds of successive wafers in a semiconductor manufacturing wafer testing operation is challenging.

In the illustrated embodiments misalignment indication decision system includes a suspected misaligned probe identifier configured to identify suspected misaligned probe s an attribute determiner configured to determine one or more attributes relating to identified suspected misaligned probe s a misprobe AKA suspected misaligned probe evaluator configured to evaluate the attribute s to decide whether or not a condition for indicating misalignment has been met and misalignment is to be indicated. In some embodiments misalignment indication decision system optionally also includes a distribution controller configured to distribute a misalignment indication a database configured to store a test data collection and or a look up table and or a processor manager configured to control the operation of one or more of the modules in misalignment indication decision system . Any of the modules in misalignment indication decision system may be made up of any combination of software hardware and or firmware that performs the functions as described and explained herein. In some embodiments misalignment indication decision system may comprise a machine specially constructed for the desired purposes and or may comprise a programmable machine selectively activated or reconfigured by specially constructed program code. In some embodiments misalignment indication decision system includes at least some hardware.

In some embodiments misalignment indication decision system may include fewer more and or different modules than shown in and . For example in some of these embodiments part or all of database may be separated out of misalignment indication decision system for example included instead in tester or in a separate unit or may be omitted. As another example in some embodiments suspected misaligned probe identifier may be separated out of misalignment indication decision system . As another example in some embodiments attribute determiner or just a position analyzer part may be separated out of misalignment indication decision system . For instance in some embodiments there may be advantages to the identification provided by suspected misaligned probe identifier and or the position attribute analysis provided by attribute determiner position analyzer even when separated from the functionality of the remainder of system . In some embodiments the functionality of misalignment indication decision system may be divided differently than illustrated among the modules illustrated in and . In some embodiments misalignment indication decision system may include additional less and or different functionality than described herein. For example misalignment indication decision system may include additional functionality relating to testing and or support functionality for additional modules such as computer terminals networked test program servers and or networked data storage systems.

In the illustrated embodiments test data collection is shown stored in database but in some embodiments some or all of test data collection is made accessible to identifier without being stored in database or without being stored at all. Test data collection includes test results from parametric tests and or pass fail tests relevant to a current decision on whether or not to indicate misalignment for example results of parametric and or pass fail tests which are sensitive to misalignment . For pass fail tests only failing results may be included in test data collection or both passing and failing results may be included.

Embodiments of the current invention do not limit test data collection . However for the sake of further illustration to the reader some examples will now be presented. Examples of test data collection include inter alia data over a plurality of touchdowns for a single probe data over a plurality of touchdowns for selected probe s data over a plurality of touchdown for probe s previously identified as suspected misaligned data over a plurality of touchdowns for all probes data from a single touchdown for selected probes data from a single touchdown for all probes etc. Depending on the embodiment a plurality of touchdowns may refer to selected touchdowns within a wafer selected touchdowns within a plurality of wafers in a lot selected touchdowns within a plurality of wafers in multiple lots all touchdowns within a wafer all touchdowns within a lot all touchdowns within a plurality of lots etc.

In some embodiments the scope of test data collection varies depending on the type of misalignment indication decision to be made based on that test data collection. For example if looking for variation within touchdown for instance due to individual misaligned probes then in some cases a particular test data collection may include data from a single touchdown. As another example if looking for variation between touchdowns for instance due to drift in one or more directions then in some cases a particular test data collection may include data from a plurality of touchdowns. As another example if looking for variation within wafer for instance due to tilt of probecard and or chuck then in some cases a particular test data collection may include data from a plurality or all touchdowns in wafer .

Depending on the embodiment the extent of test data collection may be defined a priori or may be dynamic. For example assume that n identified suspected misaligned probes n 1 are required in order to make a useful misalignment indication decision. In this example test data collection needs to include sufficient test data to allow the identification of at least n suspected misaligned probes. However since the amount of data which would be sufficient to allow identification of at least n suspected misaligned probes is not known a priori the extent of test data collection may either be dynamic based on the real time identification or may be predefined to be sufficiently large so that identification of n suspected misaligned probes n 1 is sufficiently probable to meet the demands of the implementation. In another example there may not be a requirement for n identified suspected misaligned probes n 1 nor any other requirements which cannot be determined a priori and therefore in this example the extent of test data collection may be predefined. In another example if in a previous misalignment indication decision certain probe s were identified as suspected misaligned but the decision was not to indicate misalignment then test data collection s used for subsequent misalignment indication decisions may focus on data relating to those probe s identified as suspected misaligned. Similarly in this example current test data collection may additionally or alternatively be reduced as needed while identification of suspected misaligned probes continues in order to focus on data relating to probes identified as suspected misaligned. In this example the extent of a particular test data collection may therefore be dynamically changed based on the identity of previously identified suspected misaligned probes. In another example the extent of a particular test data collection may be dynamically changed if a previous misalignment indication decision was borderline in order to allow for a more conclusive misalignment indication decision.

It is noted that depending on the embodiment only one test data collection may be accessible at a time or a plurality of test data collections each relevant for a different instance of a misalignment indication decision may be accessible at a time. In cases where a plurality of test data collections are accessible at a time the plurality may be accessed in parallel in order to make parallel misalignment decisions or the plurality may not be accessed at the same time. Assuming test data collection is stored on database then depending on the embodiment database may include only one data collection at a time or may include a plurality of data collections concurrently. Assuming different test data collections during the life of system which may or may not be accessible at the same time then depending on the embodiment each data collection which is used in a different decision on whether or not to indicate misalignment may include a unique set of data or each data collection does not necessarily include a unique set of data. As an example of the latter embodiment assuming each test data collection includes data from a plurality of touchdowns each data collection may include data relating to distinct touchdowns or two or more data collections may include data relating to at least one of the same touchdown.

In some embodiments of test data collection corresponding bondpads for test results are apparent. For example in some embodiments in wafer testing system A prober may transfer identification data of the die or dies currently being tested to tester for example die XY coordinates relating to the die position within wafer and optionally other identification data such as lot number wafer number etc. may also be provided to tester . In these embodiments tester integrates test results with identification data so that the test results identified by identification data can become part of test data collection . As another example in some embodiments of wafer testing system B misalignment indication decision system controls synchronization of testing and probing and therefore is aware of identification data of the die or dies currently being tested for example die XY coordinates relating to the die position within wafer and optionally lot number wafer number etc. Misalignment indication decision system can therefore integrate identification data with test results received from tester so that the test results identified by identification data can become part of test data collection . In various embodiments of either of the latter two examples corresponding bondpads for test results may be apparent because the test results are arranged in test data collection in a manner in which the corresponding bondpad is evident for example in consecutive order by bondpad number and or because the corresponding bondpad is explicitly indicated for each result.

In some embodiments additionally or alternatively test data collection includes data obtained from initial setup procedure s prior to testing for example from initial optical and or electrical alignment.

In the illustrated embodiments database additionally or alternatively includes a look up table or an equivalent correspondence module which associates bondpads with probe array coordinates. For example in some cases look up table comprises any convenient system readable file format such as American Standard Code for Information Interchange ASCII that includes information indicating which bondpad corresponds to which probe. Continuing with the example in some of these cases the correspondence may state that data from a certain bondpad on a die with particular X coordinate and given Y coordinate corresponds to a specific probe in the probe array. Depending on the embodiment a probe may correspond to any number of bondpads on wafer . For example a probe in some embodiments may correspond to the same number of bondpads as there are touchdowns in wafer . Depending on the embodiment look up table may be the same or may vary with test data collection . In some other embodiments look up table is included elsewhere in misalignment indication decision system . In some other embodiments the correspondence between bondpads and probes is hardcoded.

In some embodiments look up table includes entries relating to various products tested by wafer testing system and for each product that is tested table entries relating to that product are referenced. In some other embodiments each product that is tested by wafer testing system has a unique associated look up table or is uniquely hardcoded.

In some embodiments look up table includes other useful product specific information such as bondpad electrical and or physical characteristics including for example bondpad size dimensions bondpad layout and or bondpad structure etc. Additionally or alternatively in some of these embodiments look up table includes useful probecard information such as physical characteristics of probes. For example in some cases such product and or probecard specific information may be used as a basis for grouping data for common analysis see for example description of stage below and or for defining template s see for example description of template s below . In some other embodiments such product and or probecard specific information is included in a separate lookup table which does not include bondpad probe correspondence. In some other embodiments such product and or probecard specific information is not used in deciding whether or not to indicate misalignment or such product and or probecard specific information is hardcoded.

In some embodiments database may additionally or alternatively include other data for example test data irrelevant to misalignment etc.

Optionally suspected misaligned probe identifier includes a parametric analyzer configured to analyze parametric data in test data collection relating to misalignment and or a pass fail evaluator configured to evaluate pass fail data in test data collection relating to misalignment. In some embodiments with suspected parametric analyzer the analysis relates to determining whether or not there is data incongruity as will be discussed in more detail below.

Optionally attribute determiner includes a logger configured to log non position attribute s relating to suspected misaligned probe s . For example logger may log any of the following inter alia incidence e.g. number of times that a particular probe is identified as suspected misaligned the badness explained further below of a particular suspected misaligned probe incongruous parametric data the total number of and or fraction of identified suspected misaligned probe s within the probe array the likelihood ratio e.g. as described in tested die tested touchdown location of tested touchdown in wafer and or tested wafer during which a particular probe was identified each time as suspected misaligned enabling for instance independent computation of incidence per touchdown location statistical values derived from incongruous testing data parametric congruous testing data for example in order to provide a contrast electrical functionality of bondpad corresponding to particular identified suspected misaligned probe unusual physical characteristic of bondpad corresponding to particular identified suspected misaligned probe and or unusual physical characteristic of particular identified suspected misaligned probe statistical values derived from congruous testing data statistical values derived from testing data of all probes both those identified as suspected misaligned and those not so identified change in any of the above as a function of touchdown iteration number of touchdowns since the last probecard clean operation touchdown index and or touchdown identity trend etc. In various embodiments statistical values can include any appropriate statistical value such as for example mean median maximum minimum standard deviation and or rolling average etc.

Optionally additionally or alternatively attribute determiner includes a position analyzer configured to determine a position attribute of probe s identified as suspected misaligned. In some cases position analyzer includes one or more templates in order to facilitate the determination of position attribute s where each template represents a contiguous or non contiguous area on one or more wafer s . The scope of the contiguous or non contiguous area on one or more wafer s is not limited by embodiments of the invention but for the sake of further illustration to the reader some examples are now given. Examples of embodiments where the contiguous or non contiguous area is on one or more wafer s include where the area is on part of one wafer where the area is on all of one wafer where the area is on part of each of two or more wafer s where the area is on all of one wafer and on part of one or more other wafer s where the area is on all of two or more wafers where the area is on two or more wafers and on part of one or more other wafer s etc. When reference is made below to an area on one or more wafer s it should be understood that the area may be contiguous or non contiguous as appropriate in various embodiments unless explicitly stated otherwise. Depending on the embodiment of these cases each template may be of any shape size and position.

In some embodiments with templates each template consists of any convenient system readable file format that contains information assigning probes to region s of the template. In some embodiments each template may include one or more defined regions. Any useful and physically meaningful regions may be defined. Depending on the embodiment the number of probes assigned to each region assuming two or more regions may or may not be identical. Depending on the embodiment there may or may not be different templates for different anticipated misalignment problems. For example if there are different templates for different anticipated misalignment problems then in some cases different template s may be designed to highlight a rotational alignment problem say a probecard with an angular offset with respect to the wafer s X and Y axes rather than a Z alignment problem say a probecard with a tilt in the plane of the probe tips of the probe array with respect to the wafer s XY plane . As another example if there are different templates for different anticipated misalignment problems then in some cases different template s may be designed to highlight a misalignment problem particular to probes with specific physical characteristics and or particular to probes corresponding to bondpads with specific physical and or electrical characteristic s rather than to highlight a misalignment problem unrelated to probe and or bondpad physical and or electrical characteristic s .

As mentioned above each template represents a contiguous or non contiguous area on one or more wafer s . In some embodiments each template represents a touchdown and therefore each probe in the probe array is assigned as a member of one of the region s of the template.

In other embodiments there may be additionally or alternatively one or more templates to each of which are assigned a smaller number of probes larger number of probes and or different probes than in the probe array. For example even in the case of a touchdown with a plurality of dies a template may represent a die and therefore only those probes in the probe array corresponding to that die are assigned to region s of the template. As another example additionally or alternatively a template may represent some but not all dies in a touchdown and therefore only those probes in the probe array corresponding to those dies are assigned to region s of the template. As another example additionally or alternatively a template may represent a wafer and therefore assuming multiple touchdowns per wafer probes in the probe array are assigned multiple times to region s of the template. As another example additionally or alternatively a template may represent part or all of multiple wafers and therefore some or all of the probes in the probe array are assigned multiple times to region s of the template. As another example additionally or alternatively a template may represent only some of the bondpads on a die and therefore only those probes in the probe array corresponding to those bondpads are assigned to region s of the template. As another example additionally or alternatively each region of a template with two or more regions does not necessarily represent contiguous bondpads. For instance in some cases each region of the template may represent not necessarily contiguous bondpads with particular physical electrical characteristics or which correspond to probes with particular physical characteristics. Continuing with these cases assume embodiments where a probe array includes probes of varying lengths with the longer probes tending to exhibit greater variation in hitting the intended bondpads than the shorter probes. In some of these embodiments a template may be defined which is comprised of regions with each region representing non contiguous bondpads corresponding to either long or short probes.

Depending on the embodiment there may or may not be different templates for different types of data. For example in embodiments where a template represents a touchdown there may or may not be different templates for different touchdowns on wafer . In this example if there are different templates for different touchdowns then in some cases the defined region s and probe membership by region may be defined differently for templates corresponding to different touchdowns on wafer . As another example in embodiments where a template represents a die there may or may not be different templates for different dies. Similar examples would correspond to templates representing other types of areas.

In the illustrated embodiments misprobe evaluator includes misalignment indication condition so that misprobe evaluator can evaluate attribute s determined by attribute determiner singly and or in combination and decide whether or not a misalignment indication condition has been met. Depending on the embodiment condition may necessitate a particular attribute or combination of attributes or condition may be fulfilled by any of two or more stipulations where each stipulation requires a particular attribute or combination of attributes. Depending on the embodiment misalignment indication condition may be predetermined and or may be created and or adapted by system . If misalignment indication condition has been met then misalignment is to be indicated. For example in some embodiments misprobe evaluator provides a misalignment indication to distribution controller . Continuing with the example in system A distribution controller outputs a misalignment indication for example to an operator or engineering personnel e.g. indication and or to tester e.g. indication via channel with the indication optionally forwarded by tester to prober e.g. via channel A . Continuing with the example in system B distribution controller outputs a misalignment indication for example to an operator or engineering personnel e.g. indication to tester e.g. indication via channel and or to prober e.g. indication B via channel B As another example in some embodiments distribution controller is omitted and any misalignment indication is outputted to an operator engineering personnel tester and or prober by misprobe evaluator . As another example distribution controller and misprobe evaluator may both output misalignment indications.

In some embodiments control of the operation of one or more of the modules in misalignment indication decision system by process manager includes triggering suspected misaligned probe identifier to attempt to identify if there are any suspected misaligned probes. For example process manager may monitor the testing status and trigger attempts accordingly.

Optionally process manager includes a trigger configuration file . Trigger configuration file may comprise any convenient system readable file format such as ASCII which stipulates trigger point s within a test flow. In some cases trigger configuration file can also include any of the following specifications for each specified trigger point which test data collection to access see stage below how to group parametric data see stage below how to analyze a group of parametric data see stage method and other procedures for performing stage discussed below how to divide identified suspected misaligned probe s into set s for attribute determination see stage below which attributes to determine see stage below which template s to use see stage below how to perform spatial analysis see stage below which misalignment indication condition to apply see stage below which misalignment indication decision to decide see stage below any combination of the above etc. In some cases a particular trigger point may trigger access to a plurality of test data collections in order to make a plurality of independent misalignment indication decisions and therefore in some of these cases one or more of the above specifications may need to be specified per test data collection for that trigger point. In cases where a particular trigger point triggers access to a plurality of test data collections in order to make a plurality of misalignment indication decisions the triggering may be performed consecutively or in parallel. In some embodiments some or all of the above specifications may not be included in configuration file for example because the specification is the same for each trigger point included in configuration file .

In some other embodiments process manager may be omitted and triggering point s for suspected misaligned probe identifier to attempt identification may be defined a priori for instance as a static set of default conditions embedded in the logic of system for example in suspected misaligned probe identifier and or other module s . In these embodiments specification s for each trigger point may in some cases also be embedded in the logic of system .

In the illustrated embodiments a first subprocess includes any of stages to . In the illustrated embodiments in stage probes on probecard make temporary contact with bondpads of one or more dies on wafer during a current touchdown and tester executes a test program including for example one or more parametric tests and or one or more pass fail tests . Depending on the embodiment prober can perform any kind of maneuvering so that the probes make temporary contact including for example maneuvering chuck .

It is assumed that test program executed in stage includes at least one parametric test and or pass fail test whose result is sensitive to probe to pad misalignment in any dimension X Y Z or theta . Embodiments of the invention do not limit the types of parametric tests and or pass fail tests whose results are sensitive to misalignment but for the sake of further illustration to the reader some examples are now presented. One example of a parametric test that may reflect misalignment and or other issues is a contact resistance CRES test. Bondpads typically are coated with aluminum or another metal. Bondpads are typically surrounded by insulating material e.g. glassy layer also known as the passivation. Good electrical contact between probes and bondpads can only be achieved when the tips of each of these probes are positioned within a few micrometers of the centers of the corresponding bondpads while also being correctly positioned in the Z dimension and theta dimension. Under good electrical contact there would be some inherent contact resistance whose value would depend on one or more factors such as the bondpad and or probing technology measurement procedure resistance definition for example including or excluding series resistance added by measurement fixturing etc. For example in some cases the inherent contact resistance may be less than 1 ohm whereas in other cases with different factor s the range may be about 2 to 3 ohms. Any type of misalignment which alters the probe to pad force e.g. too light or too heavy depending on Z alignment and or which causes the probe tip to incompletely contact the bondpad metal surface may have an impact on contact resistance. For example if the position of a probe s tip is off target in the XY plane or rotationally misaligned so that the probe tip incompletely contacts the bondpad metal surface and or partially or fully falls on the passivation and or if the probe s tip position in the Z dimension is higher than the nominal probe tip position i.e. too little prober overdrive and too light a probe to pad force then higher than inherent contact resistance between probe and bondpad may result. At an extreme instance if a probe lands completely off the bondpad but on the passivation instead the probe will not make electrical contact with the bondpad and the measured bondpad electrical contact resistance will be infinite optionally limited by tester overvoltage protection. Lower than inherent contact resistance may alternatively or additionally occur if the probe s tip position extends substantially below the plane of the surface of wafer than the nominal probe tip Z position i.e. too much prober overdrive and too high a probe to pad force . It is noted that higher than inherent contact resistance can alternatively or additionally indicate other conditions in some embodiments such as a need for probecard cleaning as probes slowly become increasingly resistive with repeated use a damaged probe a probe blocked by a particle etc.

As another example a pass fail test which may be sensitive to misalignment is an opens test. A bondpad will fail the test typically if misalignment is severe although in some embodiments the opens test can be defined to fail for less severe misalignment. For example in some cases X Y and or theta misalignment and or Z alignment due to too little overdrive too little probe to pad force may cause an opens test failure. It is noted that in some embodiments a bondpad may additionally or alternatively fail an opens test due to other conditions such as a damaged probe a probe tip blocked by a particle etc.

Other examples of tests whose results may be sensitive to misalignment include pin leakage tests tests for a specific product whose results are affected by increases in contact resistance e.g. power supply drop on chip data latch etc a resistive drop in power supply voltages reaching the chip s internal Vdd bondpad an unusual RC delay in a high speed signal path etc.

In some embodiments at least one parametric test and or pass fail test whose result is sensitive to even slight probe to pad misalignment is included so that early detection of misalignment is possible.

In some embodiments not all tests which are sensitive to misalignment are performed. For example in some cases the tests which are performed may depend on the product. As another example in some cases the tests which are performed may depend on results of earlier performed tests. Continuing with the example and assuming that the opens test is scheduled before the contact resistance test in some of these cases if a bondpad failed an opens test contact resistance may not be measured for that bondpad.

In the illustrated embodiments in stage test data are generated. The test data can include results of tests performed in stage and generated by tester identification data of the dies currently being tested etc. As mentioned above identification data may be generated by prober by misalignment indication decision system and or otherwise.

Although the generation of test data and the format of the test data is not limited by embodiments of the invention for the sake of further illustration to the reader two examples are now given. In the first example where a device had eight input output bondpads that were submitted to the an opens test test data may include the die XY coordinates and the pass fail results in a format such as 23 18 OPENS PPPFPPPP where the die coordinates are X 23 and Y 18 the test is the opens test and of the eight bondpads the fourth failed and the rest passed the test. As another example assuming the same device with eight input output pins had contact resistance measured test data may include the die XY coordinates and the measurements in a format of 23 18 CRES 1.115 1.121 0.998 0.999 1.002 1.107 1.101 1.103 where CRES indicates that the test was contact resistance measurement.

In the illustrated embodiments in stage the generated test data is made accessible to identifier . For example in some embodiments generated test data may be stored in database so as to be accessible to identifier . As another example the generated test data may be passed to identifier for processing without storage.

In the illustrated embodiments in stage it is determined if testing has been completed. If testing has been completed then stages to are not repeated. If testing has not been completed then stages to are repeated for the next touchdown. The next touchdown may be the next touchdown on the same wafer the first touchdown on the next wafer in the same lot the first touchdown on the first wafer of the next lot etc.

In the illustrated embodiments a second sub process of method including any of stages to illustrates possible stages in some embodiments for deciding whether or not to indicate misalignment. In some embodiments the second subprocess is performed by misalignment indication decision system . Embodiments of the invention do not limit the timing of the second subprocess in relation to the timing of the first subprocess. For example in some embodiments once the second subprocess has triggered in stage various remaining stages of the second subprocess may be performed without regard to which stages of the first subprocess are being performed. As another example in some embodiments additionally or alternatively once the second subprocess has triggered at least some of the remaining stages of the second subprocess are preferably performed between various passes of stage i.e. when no touchdown of die s is currently being tested . As another example in some embodiments additionally or alternatively once the second subprocess has triggered at least some of the remaining stages of the second subprocess are preferably performed in parallel with stage i.e. when a touchdown of die s is actually being tested . As another example in some embodiments additionally or alternatively once the second subprocess has triggered at least some of the remaining stages of the second subprocess may be performed after testing has ended i.e. after a yes in stage 

In the illustrated embodiments in stage it is determined if a trigger occurred which causes the remaining stages of the second subprocess to be executed. If not method waits for a trigger. If a trigger has occurred then method proceeds to stage . In some embodiments process manager monitors the wafer testing for example monitors subprocess to and triggers the remaining stages of the second subprocess in accordance with trigger configuration file described above. In some embodiments additionally or alternatively the remaining stages of the second subprocess are triggered according to a static set of default conditions integrated for example in suspected misaligned probe identifier and or other module s in misalignment indication decision system .

Embodiments of the invention do not limit the trigger s . However for the sake of further illustration to the reader some examples will now be presented. For example trigger point s can include any of the following material processing event s after each touchdown has completed testing after a plurality of touchdowns have completed testing after a wafer has completed testing after a plurality of wafers have completed testing after a lot has completed testing after a plurality of lots have completed testing etc. As another example additionally or alternatively trigger point s can include event s not directly related to material processing such as amount of data in a system data buffer time of day time based event e.g. after every N hours of runtime shiftly daily weekly etc manufacturing based event metric such as after the first N wafers have been tested following a set up conversion from Product Type A to Product Type B or when low yield has been observed etc after a maintenance operation for example after every probecard clean operation whenever misalignment indication decision system is available etc.

In some examples of trigger point s additionally or alternatively a specified trigger point for a particular misalignment indication is substantially soon after the required test data collection is complete. For instance in some of these examples after each touchdown a decision for a type of misalignment which could be manifested within an individual touchdown such as one or more probes that are out of alignment may be triggered with test data collection possibly including data from that touchdown. Additionally or alternatively for instance in some of these examples a decision for a type of misalignment which could be manifested after a plurality of touchdowns such as a gradual continuous drift from time zero in one or more directions monotonically getting worse in X Y Z and or theta dimension may be triggered after a plurality of touchdowns with test data collection possibly including data from those touchdowns. Additionally or alternatively for instance in some of these examples a decision for a type of misalignment which may be manifested at the wafer level such as probe chuck and or probecard that is tilted in the Z direction causing touchdowns near the high Z part of the wafer to have too much probe force and touchdowns near the low Z part of the wafer having too little probe force may be triggered after a wafer has completed testing with test data collection possibly including data from all touchdowns of that wafer. However in some other examples of trigger point s additionally or alternatively a specified trigger point may be at a point later in time than when the test data collection needed for the misalignment indication decision is complete. For instance a trigger point may be deferred in order to postpone the analysis necessary for the misalignment indication decision to a time when tester and or system is idle. Continuing with this instance in some of these examples the trigger point for a misalignment indication decision may be when the current wafer or lot is being switched even if the misalignment indication decision does not require testing data from later touchdowns in the current wafer or lot because there is typically more idle time during the switching of the wafer or lot than at other times such as when indexing between touchdowns. In examples where a misalignment indication decision is deferred any action resulting from a decision to indicate misalignment would also be deferred.

As mentioned above depending on the embodiment a trigger point may trigger access to one data collection and one pass of remaining stages of subprocess to in order to make a misalignment decision or multiple accesses to a plurality of test data collections and a plurality of passes in order to make a plurality of independent misalignment decisions consecutively or in parallel. For simplicity of explanation it is assumed in the description below that access to one data collection and one pass of the remaining stages of subprocess to is triggered at trigger point .

In the illustrated embodiments in stage test data collection is accessed for example by suspected misaligned probe identifier . Test data collection includes inter alia data generated and made accessible in one or more iterations of stages and which will be analyzed in one pass of stages to in order to make a decision on whether or not to indicate misalignment. See above description of for additional details on various embodiments of test data collection .

Depending on the embodiment in the current pass of method stages to may be performed stages to may be performed and or both stages to and stages to may be performed. In embodiments where both stages to and stages to are performed stages to may or may not be performed in parallel with stages to .

In the illustrated embodiments of stage pass fail data relating to misalignment in test data collection is examined for example by pass fail evaluator .

In the illustrated embodiments of stage it is determined for example by pass fail evaluator whether or not any bondpads failed tests relating to misalignment. Refer again to the example of test data which in the form of 23 18 OPENS P P P F P P P . Pass fail evaluator may detect the F in the fourth position indicating that the fourth bondpad failed the test while the P s in the other positions indicate that the other bondpads passed the test.

If there are any failing bondpads yes to stage then stage is performed. If there are no failing bondpads then stage is skipped.

In some embodiments test data in test data collection which relate to pass fail tests may only include failure results. In these embodiments stages to may be simplified because there are no passing results to be examined.

In the illustrated embodiments in stage probe s corresponding to failing bondpad s are identified as suspected misaligned probe s for instance by pass fail evaluator . In some embodiments the determination of which probe s correspond to the failing bondpad s is facilitated by the usage of lookup table . In some embodiments data corresponding to identified suspected misaligned probes is indexed to probe identity e.g. position within probe array of probecard and or touchdown identity e.g. serialized by within wafer and within lot probing sequence and or by wafer identify and position within wafer of individual touchdown .

In the illustrated embodiments in stage it is determined for instance by pass fail evaluator whether or not all pass fail data required for attribute determination has been processed. In some embodiments all pass fail data related to misalignment in test data collection is processed in one or more iterations of stages to prior to determining attribute s . Depending on the embodiment the amount of pass fail data processed in each iteration may vary. If another iteration is required yes to stage then method iterates back to stage . If no more iterations are required then method proceeds with stage optionally after waiting for stages to to also be completed .

In the illustrated embodiments in stage a group of parametric data in test data collection relating to misalignment is analyzed for instance by parametric analyzer . Depending on the embodiment the group may include all the parametric data in test data collection relating to misalignment or may include only part of the parametric data. It is assumed that any feature or artifact that increases the standard deviation of measurements of a group of parametric test data being analyzed together could possibly lead to a false conclusion of defective subpopulations and or may mask the presence of actual defective subpopulations. Therefore in some embodiments each group includes parametric test data results preferably resulting from the same parametric test which are expected to be sufficiently similar to one another under identical physical probe to pad contact conditions.

For example assume test data collection relates to all bondpads or selected bondpads tested during one or more touchdowns. Further assume in this example that bondpads can be classified according to the characteristic electronic design and or physical characteristics so that each group of parametric data relates to performing a given test on bondpads with similar electrical and or physical characteristics. Continuing with the example assume as a simplified instance that test data collection includes CRES measurements for 16 bondpads with similar physical characteristics but of which eight are bidirectional input output bondpads four are dedicated input bondpads e.g. clock input output enable etc and two are power supply bondpads. Due to differences in the electronic circuits of the device design that are connected to the various types of bondpads the electrical characteristics under CRES measurement may differ producing different CRES measurement values even under identical probe to pad contact conditions. Therefore in this example the CRES test results relating to bidirectional input output bondpads dedicated input bondpads and power supply bondpads are analyzed in separate groups. In another example assume that the bondpads of the previous example also differ based on relevant physical characteristics such as bondpad location structural dimensions film thicknesses and or structure some of which may be related to natural variation in fabrication conditions and or to bondpad design. In this example CRES measurements can be divided into groups each of which is distinguished by electrical characteristic and or physical characteristic from the other groups. In some embodiments of these examples the division into groups may be facilitated by probecard and or product specific information which may be provided for example by look up table .

Depending on the embodiment of stage the analysis may or may not be statistical. Further below some embodiments of analysis procedures for stage are described.

In the illustrated embodiments of stage it is assumed that the analysis of stage enables determination if there is data incongruity in the group. If data incongruity exist yes to stage then method continues with stage . If on the other hand data incongruity does not exist no to stage then method skips stages and .

In the illustrated embodiments in stage it is determined which data is incongruous. For example it is determined which test result s are incongruous with other test results in the group.

In the illustrated embodiments in stage the probe s which correspond to bondpad s whose test results are incongruous are identified as suspected misaligned. In some embodiments the determination of which probe s correspond to the bondpad s with incongruous test results is facilitated by the usage of lookup table . It is noted that in some embodiments a particular bondpad may only have test result s which are either incongruous or congruous with group test results whereas in other embodiments this is not necessarily so and a particular bondpad may in some cases have test result s which are incongruous as well as test result s which are congruous. In some embodiments data corresponding to identified suspected misaligned probes is indexed to probe identity e.g. position within probe array of probecard and or touchdown identity e.g. serialized by within wafer and within lot probing sequence and or by wafer identify and position within wafer of individual touchdown .

In the illustrated embodiments in stage it is determined if all groups which should be processed prior to attribute determination have been processed. If all groups have been processed yes to stage then method proceeds to stage optionally after waiting for stages to to also be completed . If all groups have not been processed no to stage then method iterates to process the next group beginning with stage .

In some embodiments each group may include unique data points compared to any other groups whereas in other embodiments this may not necessarily be the case and any particular data point may be common to one or more groups.

In some embodiments there may be one or more group s common to the current test data collection and to test data collection s used in previous misalignment decision indication passes. In some of these embodiments the common group s may be again analyzed in stages to in order to identify suspected misaligned probes in the group s if any. In other of these embodiments the common group s may not be re analyzed in stages to but the identities of any suspected misaligned probes relating to the common group s which were previously identified may be retrieved.

It is noted that identifying a probe as being suspected misaligned in stage or does not necessarily mean that the probe is misaligned. For example as noted above other circumstances may lead to a probe being suspected for misalignment for example a dirty probe damaged probe a probe tip blocked by a particle. For this reason the term suspected is used.

In some embodiments the identification of suspected misaligned probe s is advantageous. Some examples of advantages will now be provided for further illustration to the reader but embodiments of the invention do not limit the possible advantages. For example in some embodiments the identification of suspected misaligned probe s in stage or enables tracking to see if the same probe s are consistently being identified as suspected misaligned for each iteration of stage or or there is instead inconsistency in which probe s are identified as suspected misaligned. Continuing with the example in some cases the consistency or inconsistency for example as recorded by an incidence attribute see below across touchdowns and or across wafers may be useful in making the decision of whether or not to indicate misalignment. As another example in some embodiments additionally or alternatively the identification of suspected misaligned probe s in stage or may cause future analysis to focus only on data relating to corresponding bondpad s or cause future analysis to focus more on such data than on data relating to other bondpads. Continuing with the example in some cases only data relating to bondpad s whose corresponding probe s were previously identified as suspected misaligned based on data from previous touchdown s is analyzed to see if there is an upward trend in parametric measurements such as CRES and or for other tracking purposes. As another example in some embodiments additionally or alternatively data relating to probe s identified as suspected misaligned in stage or is excluded from any calculations reserved for normal parametric measurements such as normal CRES measurements. Continuing with the example in some cases if it is desired to calculate the mean and standard deviation to model a nominal dataset for example for the unimodal model described below with reference to stage of data relating to identified suspected misaligned probe s may be excluded. As another example in some embodiments additionally or alternatively the identification of suspected misaligned probes in stage or enables the determination of common attributes between identified probes. Continuing with the example in some cases it can be determined if all identified suspected misaligned probes are associated with bondpads that are located at particular positions on a die or which have common electrical functionality. As another example in some embodiments additionally or alternatively the identification of suspected misaligned probes in stage or enables position attribute analysis across more than one touchdown and or for the same touchdown s across more than one wafer. As another example additionally or alternatively the identity of the suspected misaligned probe s and optionally other analysis results as identified in stage or can be reported to engineering personnel and or an operator for use in determining the root cause of the problem. Continuing with the example in some cases identified suspected misaligned probe s may be subsequently optically inspected in order to narrow down the list of hypothetical root cause problems.

It should be apparent from the above advantages that in some cases it may be advantageous to identify suspected misaligned probe s even outside the context of a misalignment indication decision or in a different misalignment indication system than described with respect to method . Similarly suspected misaligned probe identifier may in these cases be useful even separate from a misalignment indication system or within a different misalignment indication system than system .

In the illustrated embodiments in stage one or more attributes of a set of one or more identified suspected misaligned probe s is determined for example by attribute determiner .

Depending on the embodiment the determination of attribute s of identified suspected misaligned probe s can be performed on one or more sets of identified suspected misaligned probe s . Embodiments of the invention do not limit the division into sets but for the sake of further illustration to the reader some examples are now given. For example in some embodiments all identified suspected misaligned probe s may belong to the same set and attributes s for the set may be determined. In another example in some embodiments additionally or alternatively suspected misaligned probe s identified via pass fail test data may be part of one set analyzed for attribute s and suspected misaligned probe s identified via parametric test data may be part of a different set which is separately analyzed for attribute s . In another example suspected misaligned probe s corresponding to incongruous data with larger value s than congruous data may be part of one set analyzed for attribute s and suspected misaligned probe s corresponding to incongruous data with smaller value s than congruous data may be part of a different set analyzed for attribute s . In another example in some embodiments additionally or alternatively suspected misaligned probes from touchdowns on different locations on a wafer may be part of different sets. In another example additionally or alternatively in embodiments which include a plurality of templates used by a position analyzer to determine a position attribute each identified suspected misaligned probe may be included in a plurality of sets dependent on the number of relevant templates as will be explained in more detail below. In embodiments with more than one set each set may include unique identified suspected misaligned probe s or each set may not necessarily include unique identified suspected misaligned probe s and partial or full overlap among identified suspected misaligned probe s which are members of each set is possible.

The invention does not limit the possible attribute s which may be determined in stage . However for the sake of further illustration to the reader some examples will now be presented. Examples of possible attribute categories include any of the following inter alia actual test results statistical attribute s temporal attribute s e.g. history electrical and or physical characteristics attributes position geographical attribute s etc. Examples of possible attribute s which may or may not fit the listed attribute categories include any of the following inter alia incidence e.g. number of times that a particular probe is identified as suspected misaligned the badness explained below of a particular suspected misaligned probe incongruous parametric data corresponding to the set the total number of and or fraction of identified suspected misaligned probe s within the probe array the likelihood ratio e.g. as described in tested die tested touchdown location of tested touchdown in wafer and or tested wafer during which a particular probe was identified each time as suspected misaligned enabling for instance independent computation of incidence per touchdown location electrical functionality of bondpad corresponding to a particular identified misaligned probe unusual physical characteristic of bondpad corresponding to particular identified suspected misaligned probe and or unusual physical characteristic of particular suspected misaligned probe statistical values derived from incongruous testing data corresponding to the set parametric congruous testing data for example in order to provide a contrast statistical values derived from congruous testing data statistical values derived from testing data of all probes both those identified as suspected misaligned and those not so identified change in any of the above as a function of touchdown iteration number of touchdowns since the last probecard clean operation touchdown index and or of touchdown identity trend etc. In various embodiments separate statistical values may be derived from testing data which was analyzed in different groups or statistical values may be derived from testing data which was analyzed in all groups of the current pass. In various embodiments statistical values can include any appropriate statistical value such as for example mean i.e. average median maximum minimum standard deviation and or rolling average etc. Depending on the embodiment and the attribute determination of attributes derived for different sets of identified suspected misaligned probe s may or may not be cumulative for test data collection . For example in some embodiments an incidence attribute for a particular suspected misaligned probe which is included in more than one set cumulates over all sets in which the probe is included. In other embodiments of the same example accumulation is not required since suspected misaligned probes would be evaluated as one set for incidence attribute even though not necessarily for other attributes or because separate incidence counters for each set is preferable for making the misalignment indication decision. Assuming embodiments where if a particular bondpad fails a pass fail test sensitive to misalignment and parametric measurements for a test sensitive to misalignment is in any event performed on that bondpad in some of these embodiments if a probe is identified as suspected misaligned based on data from a pass fail test and also identified as suspected misaligned based on data from a parametric test where the data from both tests relates to the same touchdown the incidence attribute is incremented once whereas in other of these embodiments the incidence attribute is incremented twice.

In some embodiments with a badness attribute the badness of an individual suspected misaligned probe may be expressed in any appropriate manner for example by the incidence of a probe being identified as suspected misaligned by the incidence of a probe being identified as suspected misaligned per touchdown location in a wafer by the mean median or maximum values that have been observed for the corresponding probed bondpads etc. In some embodiments the badness attribute may additionally or alternatively be expressed as a function of the congruous testing data points or of the statistical parameters of a distribution of the congruous data points. For example in some of these embodiments the number of standard deviations from the average of the distribution of the congruous data points that were analyzed in the same group s as the incongruous data associated with an identified suspected misaligned probe or the average or maximum value of the incongruous data associated with an identified suspected misaligned probe may be computed and used as a parametric figure of merit of the badness .

In some embodiments an unusual physical characteristic for a bondpad may relate to an unusual layout feature such as a bondpad which is relatively small or large. Similarly in some embodiments an unusual physical characteristic for a probe may relate to an unusual design feature such as a probe which is relatively long or short.

In some embodiments the determined attribute s additionally or alternatively include position attribute s . In some of these embodiments position attribute s are determined by a spatial analysis. In some cases of spatial analysis spatial analysis calculates one or more metrics which quantifies the placement of the set of identified suspected misaligned probes with respect to a contiguous or non contiguous area on one or more wafers and the position attribute s include these calculated metric s . Embodiments of the invention do not limit the type of metric s but for further illustration to the reader some examples are now provided. Possible examples of metric s include spatial density computations such as spatial probabilities counts percentages ratios etc spatial variation a measure of randomness versus systematic dispersion of a plurality of identified suspected misaligned probes etc. Continuing with the example for probabilities spatial probabilities may in some embodiments include the probability of the actual placement of the set compared to the expected placement where the expected placement may depend on the embodiment. For instance the expected placement in this example may be random in one embodiment or non random in another embodiment. In some embodiments the calculated metric s allow the deduction of other possible position attribute s such as the likelihood of dispersion of the identified suspected misaligned probes being random versus systematic regions of clustering of the identified suspected misaligned probes within the area etc. In some embodiments determination of the position attribute s is facilitated through the usage of one or more template s . Embodiments of possible methods for determination of position attribute s are provided further below.

In the illustrated embodiments of stage it is determined if another set of identified suspected misaligned probe s needs to be processed for attribute determination prior to making a misalignment indication decision. If yes yes to stage then attribute s are determined for another set in another iteration of stage . If no other sets need to be processed then method continues with stage .

In the illustrated embodiments in stage it is decided for example by misprobe evaluator whether or not a misalignment indication condition has been met and misalignment is to be indicated. For instance misprobe evaluator may evaluate attribute s determined in stage and decide if misalignment indication condition has been met by the attribute s singly and or in combination. Depending on the embodiment condition for a misalignment indication may necessitate a particular attribute or combination of attributes or condition may be fulfilled by any one of two or more stipulations where each stipulation requires a particular attribute or combination of attributes. Depending on the embodiment misalignment indication condition and all possible stipulations may be predetermined or there may be a possibility for creating and or adapting misalignment indication condition and or one or more stipulations. As an example of the latter embodiment in some cases if a previous misalignment decision was to not indicate misalignment due to the absence of one stipulated attribute even though remaining stipulated attribute s were present then a current misalignment decision may be to indicate misalignment if the stipulated attribute that was previously absent is present even if one of the previously present stipulated attribute s is now absent.

Embodiments of the invention do not limit the attribute s which are required to meet the misalignment indication condition but for the sake of further illustration to the reader some examples are now given. For example in some embodiments an attribute required singly or in combination may be that a median or average value for all CRES measurements whose incongruity led to corresponding probes to be identified as suspected misaligned is above a predetermined threshold or that a median or average value for all CRES measurements whose incongruity led to corresponding probes to be identified as suspected misaligned is above a value threshold relative to the median or average value for all congruous data. As another example in some embodiments an attribute required singly or in combination may be that incidence of a probe being identified as suspected misaligned is above a predetermined threshold or that incidence of a probe being identified as suspected misaligned which was previously never flagged as suspected misaligned is above a predetermined threshold. As another example in some embodiments an attribute required singly or in combination may be incidence of a probe being identified as suspected misaligned in at least x out of the last y touchdowns. As another example in some embodiments an attribute required singly or in combination may be incidence of a probe being identified as suspected misaligned in touchdown a to d of the last few wafers. As another example in some embodiments an attribute required singly or in combination may be that spatial density such as spatial probability count ratio and or percentage of suspected misaligned probes in one or more regions of an area for example as represented by template s is are above a predetermined floor and or below a predetermined ceiling.

In the illustrated embodiments if it is determined that the misalignment indication condition has not been met and therefore misalignment is not to be indicated no to stage then method iterates back to stage waiting for the next trigger if any to make one or more new misalignment indication decision s . If instead it is determined that the misalignment indication condition has been met and misalignment is to be indicated yes to stage then misalignment is indicated in stage . For example misprobe evaluator may provide misalignment indication to distribution controller which in turn distributes misalignment indication s e.g. indication and or B outside of misalignment decision system . As another example additionally or alternatively misprobe evaluator may output misalignment indication s directly from misalignment decision system .

Embodiments of the invention do not limit the type of misalignment indication but for further illustration to the reader some examples will now be presented. For example a misalignment indication may include an automatic abort indication to tester and or prober e.g. indication and or B and or a notification indication to an operator and or engineering personnel e.g. indication which may include a hardware indication such as a red light and or may include an indication sent in any appropriate fashion including via email beeper and or as part of a report etc In some cases the notification may be recognizable to the operator as indicating that action is required for example manual abort review to see if aborting is necessary etc. In some cases the notification may additionally or alternatively be informative for example providing diagnostic output from execution of method . In some of these cases the diagnostic output can include the identity of the suspected misaligned probes and or any other appropriate data.

Embodiments of the invention do not limit consequences of an automatic or manual abort but for the sake of further illustration to the reader some examples are now given. Consequences may include for example not performing part or all of method . Continuing with the example in some cases at least performance of stage may be stopped. Consequences may additionally or alternatively include for example further diagnostic troubleshooting such as optical inspection of scrub marks left on the bond pads of a wafer which has been tested for instance either manually using a microscope attached to prober with the wafer remaining in place or off line using a specialized automated inspection tool. In some cases of troubleshooting system may be interfaced to diagnostic equipment in order to facilitate troubleshooting. Consequences may additionally or alternatively include one or more alignment procedures.

In some embodiments an indication which is not a misalignment indication may be provided even if the decision is to not provide a misalignment indication. For example diagnostic output may be provided despite the decision to not indicate misalignment. As another example additionally or alternatively an indication may be provided because the decision that misalignment condition was not met led to the determination that some other condition was met. Continuing with the example in some cases a clean or damaged probe indication may be output if the analysis led to that conclusion see for example discussion of further below . In some embodiments an indication unrelated to misalignment may be provided in addition to the misalignment indication.

In the illustrated embodiments after misalignment has been indicated in stage it is determined in stage whether or not to wait for any additional triggers. If it is decided to wait for any additional triggers yes to stage then method iterates back to stage waiting for the next trigger if any . If instead it is decided not to wait for any additional triggers no to stage then method ends. For example in some embodiments if the misalignment indication includes an automatic abort and or notification to manually abort then the decision is to not wait for any additional triggers. In these embodiments if the misalignment indication does not include an automatic abort nor a notification to manually abort then the decision is to wait for the next trigger if any . Alternatively in some embodiments even if the misalignment indication does not include an automatic abort nor a notification to manually abort the decision in some cases may be to not wait for any additional triggers. For example in some of these embodiments the decision may be to not wait for any additional triggers if the current misalignment indication was sufficiently informative to allow the operator to review and determine if manual abort is necessary.

Some embodiments of the current invention may be advantageous for any of the following reasons first identification of suspected misaligned probes may be advantageous compared to a method where there is no identification. See above description of some possible advantages of identification before description of stage . Second additionally or alternatively in embodiments with parametric data the decision of whether or not to indicate misalignment may in some cases be more fine tuned due to the analysis of parametric data that can take on any of multiple values compared to a method which only included analysis of binary pass fail test results. This fine tuning for example can in some of these cases lead to a misalignment indication being output at an advantageous time. Continuing with the example if a decision to indicate misalignment instead relied only on say the opens test then indicating misalignment after say only one failure may in some instances be not as advantageous because the failure may be due to wafer fabrication error rather than misalignment but indicating misalignment only after say 5 failures may in some cases be not as advantageous because the misalignment by then may be severe. Third additionally or alternatively in some cases tester and prober do not need to be adapted in order to implement method .

Fourth additionally or alternatively in embodiments with position attribute determination position attribute s may in some cases be useful in making a misalignment indication decision. In some of these embodiments as mentioned above position attribute s include metric s calculated by a spatial analysis which quantifies the placement of the set of identified suspected misaligned probes with respect to a contiguous or non contiguous area on one or more wafers . In these embodiments it may in some instances be advantageous to determine position attribute s by such a spatial analysis even outside the context of a misalignment indication decision or in a different misalignment indication system than described with respect to method . Similarly position analyzer may in these instances be useful even separate from a misalignment indication system or within a different misalignment indication system than system .

As mentioned above the parametric analysis of stage the determination whether or not there is incongruity in stage and or the determination of which data is incongruous in stage may in some cases be performed statistically. Additionally or alternatively as mentioned below with reference to the parametric analysis of stage the determination whether or not there is incongruity in stage and or the determination of which data is incongruous in stage may in some cases be performed statistically. One possible statistical method includes a maximum likelihood estimation method. An example of a maximum likelihood estimation method is illustrated in according to some embodiments of the invention. In some embodiments of the invention method is performed by parametric analyzer or . In some embodiments stages which are shown in as being executed sequentially may be executed in parallel. In some embodiments method may include more less and or different stages than illustrated in . In some embodiments stages may be executed in a different order than illustrated in .

In the illustrated embodiments method may be used for identifying multimodality i.e. bimodality or higher within a group of data being analyzed. For simplicity of description it is assumed that the group of data includes CRES measurements although in other embodiments other parametric data whose values are sensitive to misalignment may be used additionally or alternatively.

In the illustrated embodiments in stage the group of data points are divided into subgroups with the number of subgroups equaling the number of Gaussian modes AKA components sources distributions in the model. It is noted that this division into subgroups is based on a hypothesis not yet proven that the group of data is derived from a multimodal distribution consisting of two or more Gaussian components rather than from a unimodal distribution derived from a single Gaussian source. All data values in the group are numerically sorted and then the group of data values are divided equally into as many sub groups as are included in the multimodal model under consideration. It is initially assumed that each group s members are derived from a different Gaussian component and thus each group s data points are initially associated with the Gaussian distribution defined by the mean and standard deviation computed from those data. For a bimodal model for example the sorted data are divided into upper and lower halves and initial assignment is made of all of the lower valued data points to a low mean value model Gaussian and all of the higher valued data points to a high mean value model Gaussian.

In some embodiments for each of the defined sub groupings and for each of the data points the assignment of data points to sub groups is represented within a membership status array whose elements are initialized to values of 0 or 1 depending on whether or not a particular data point has been assigned to a particular sub group. For a bimodal model for example with a low value data point sub grouping designated by a 0 and a high value data point sub grouping designated by a 1 and also a data point index designated by j the membership status array Z sub group data point may be initialized such that Z 0 j 1 and Z 1 j 0 when j refers to data points in the lower half of sorted values while Z 0 j 0 and Z 1 j 1 when j refers to data points in the upper half of sorted values. In other embodiments rather than limiting the membership array to discrete values of 0 and 1 values in a continuous range from 0.0 to 1.0 may be assigned. In such embodiments sub group membership of a data value is quantified by this weighting factor for computational purposes in which values closer to 1.0 than to 0.0 indicate a higher likelihood of membership of the data value to the given sub group. This continuous range will be described in more detail further below.

In the illustrated embodiments in stage based on the initial assignment of data points described above an initial mean standard deviation and or mixing fraction are calculated for each of the defined sub groups using only the data points assigned to the subgroups. For a bimodal model for example the values of the membership array Z sub group data point are used as a multiplier to the data values in computing an initial mean and standard deviation for both the low value sub group and for the high value sub group causing individual data points to be either included or omitted from the calculations. The mixing fraction refers to the fraction of data points that have been assigned to each sub group and is designated by the variable sub group . For a bimodal model for example the initial mixing fraction values for both low value and high value sub groups would be 0.50.

In general the multimodal distribution is modeled as consisting of two or more Gaussian components. For a distribution model with g Gaussian components the mixture probability density function may be represented as

The above mixture probability density function provides a probability value for any given value of x given a multimodal distribution modeled as a linear combination of Gaussians each of a given mean and standard deviation with each weighted according to its respective mixing fraction.

In the illustrated embodiments a maximum likelihood estimation is calculated in stage . For ease of calculation it is actually the log likelihood value that is typically calculated in Maximum Likelihood Estimation given by L in the equation below where represents the full set of model parameters being used in the present calculation iteration. For instance in a bimodal model may include the mean and standard deviation for mode 1 the mean and standard deviation for mode 2 and the mixing fraction.

In the above equation variable i represents the sub group and is therefore incremented for summation over all of the multimodal Gaussian components of the model with i values ranging from 1 to g the total number of sub groupings . Variable j represents the data point and is therefore incremented for summation over all of the data points with j values ranging from 1 to N the total number of data points in the group . The probability density function for each Gaussian component is given by x which describes the probability of observing a sample data value of xfrom a Gaussian distribution where stands for the particular mean and standard deviation parameters that define the Gaussian . The Gaussian probability density function is well known in the art and will therefore not be further described here. The mixing fraction variable described above also appears in the equation as i as does the membership array appearing as Z i j .

In the illustrated embodiments beginning with a first iteration stage membership of the data points in the various subgroups is re evaluated in stage using the set of model parameters from the previous iteration or in the case of the first iteration then using the initial set of model parameters . For each of the Gaussian sub groups of the previous iteration s model or initial model in the case of the first iteration the density function probability for each point is computed and multiplied by the previous iteration s mixing fraction or in the case of the first iteration the initial mixing fraction for that sub group. The resulting set of numbers one for each data point Gaussian combination is proportional to the probability of individual data points belonging to a particular Gaussian of the multimodal model where larger numbers indicate higher probability. This is based on the fact that the likelihood of a given data point being associated with a particular Gaussian component is proportional both to the relative amplitude of that Gaussian to the other model components indicated by the mixing fraction and also to the statistical probability of encountering a data point with the given value from a sample of that Gaussian i.e. the Gaussian s density function probability for the particular data point value . By dividing each of the values obtained for a given data point by the sum of all values for that point summing across all Gaussian model components the values are normalized to a range from 0.0 to 1.0 and may be suitably used as improved estimates in the membership array Z i j . In some embodiments the revised values may be substituted with discrete values of 0 or 1 depending on whether the calculation yields a value closer to 0.0 or to 1.0. In embodiments in which the membership array Z i j contains non discrete values as described above the results of the calculation may be used as is.

In the illustrated embodiments having re evaluated in stage point membership of each of the Gaussian components of the multimodal model in stage a new mean standard deviation and mixing fraction are calculated for each subgroup to replace those of the previous iteration or in the case of the first iteration to replace the initial values . The means and standard deviations are calculated in the usual way except that in the summations across all data points of each sub group data point values are replaced with the product of each data point value and the membership array value for the data point sub group combination i.e. x Z sub group j . In addition the total number of data points N used in the usual calculations of mean and standard deviation is replaced with the sum of the values Z sub group j summed across all data points. In embodiments in which membership array Z i j contains discrete 0 and 1 values the calculation described amounts to either including or excluding individual points from the mean and standard deviation calculation of any given sub group. For embodiments in which membership array Z i j contains variable none discrete values ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 the calculation weights individual points in the mean and standard deviation calculations according to the degree of each point s sub group membership. For revision of the mixing fractions of the groups sub group the values of the membership array for each sub group Z sub group j are summed across all data points and is then divided by the total number of data points.

In the illustrated embodiments at the end of the current iteration in stage the revised values of the membership status array and of the various parameters that describe the Gaussian components of the model including for each sub group the mean standard deviation and mixing fraction are then used to calculate the maximum likelihood estimation using the equation for L previously given.

In the illustrated embodiments in stage the value of the maximum likelihood estimation calculated in the current iteration of stage is compared to the value obtained from the previous iteration or in the case of the first iteration then compared to the initial value calculated in stage . As the algorithm converges on the most probable Gaussian parameters of the multimodal model and data point assignment the value of L increases and the difference between L of the current iteration and the previous iteration or initial L in the case of the first iteration asymptotically approaches zero.

In the illustrated embodiments in stage it is determined if the difference between the L of the current iteration and the previous iteration or initial L in the case of the first iteration has fallen below a predetermined value and or a predetermined maximum number of iterations has been reached. The predetermined value and or predetermined maximum for example may have been defined by the operator. If the difference has not fallen below the predetermined value and the predetermined maximum number of iterations has not been reached no to stage then method continues to the next iteration stage beginning with stage . If the difference has fallen below the predetermined value or the maximum number of iterations has been reached yes to stage then the iteration loop described above is terminated and method continues to stage . In other embodiments only either the predetermined value or predetermined maximum may determine whether or not the iteration loop has terminated and or one or more other conditions may additionally or alternatively determine whether or not the iteration loop has terminated. At the conclusion of the last iteration the optimal multimodal model is defined by the values of the various parameters discussed here. The optimal multimodal model is the highest probability multi modal model for the given group of data.

In the illustrated embodiments in stage the maximum likelihood estimation for a unimodal model the alternate hypothesis is calculated. Under the unimodal model assumption consisting of a single Gaussian distribution the above maximum likelihood estimation calculations are greatly simplified requiring only a single calculation of the mean and standard deviation from the entire group of data and then performing the summation of the log of the density function of that model distribution across all values of the data group. The expression for calculation of L 1 the maximum likelihood estimation for such a unimodal model is given as 

In the illustrated embodiments in stage it is determined whether the multi modal model is more appropriate than the unimodal model. For example a decision that a multi modal model is more appropriate yes to stage is an example of a decision that there is incongruity yes to stage or which will lead to a determination of which data points are outliers stage which is an example of stage or so that probes or socket contacts corresponding to those data points may be identified as suspected misaligned in stage or . Continuing with the example a decision instead that a unimodal model is more appropriate no to stage is an example of a determination that there no incongruity no to stage or .

In some embodiments the determination in stage includes the computation of a likelihood ratio. In these embodiments the comparison of the multimodal for example bimodal model to the unimodal model is typically expressed as the natural log of the ratio of the unimodal maximum likelihood estimation value computed in stage to the multimodal e.g. bi modal maximum likelihood estimation value computed in the last iteration of stage times the number 2 . In these embodiments this log likelihood ratio statistic has the form Likelihood Ratio 2 ln 1 

In these embodiments when the value of the Likelihood Ratio is sufficiently large it may be concluded that for the given data set the multimodal e.g. bi modal model is a better fit to the data than a unimodal model. The conclusion depends partly on the number of data points that are applied to the calculation. In some cases it may be preferable that the number of data points N be greater than 50 to reliably reject the unimodal hypothesis in favor of a bimodal model. The definition of sufficiently large may vary depending on the implementation. In one non limiting implementation bi modality may be assumed rather than uni modality if the calculated likelihood ratio is greater than the maximum historical likelihood ratio when the unimodal model was appropriate e.g. greater than the maximum historical likelihood ratio prior to the onset of misalignment 

In some embodiments where a likelihood ratio is used a convenient feature of the form of the likelihood ratio given in the above equation is that for a sufficiently large number of data points and for a bimodal model in which the standard deviations of the two Gaussian components are similar in size an estimate of the statistical significance of the result may be derived from the well known chi squared distribution with the number of degrees of freedom equal to twice the difference between the number of parameters of the two models under comparison. For the comparison of a bimodal model whose parameters include two means and two standard deviations to a unimodal model whose parameters include one mean and one standard deviation the number of degrees of freedom would therefore be equal to 2. In some other embodiments particularly those in which the requirements of applying the chi squared statistics are not met the threshold for the likelihood Ratio being sufficiently large may be set empirically by users of the method rather than being based on a statistical confidence level.

In the illustrated embodiments if it was determined in stage that the multimodal model is more appropriate yes to stage then in stage it is determined which data points s are outlier s . Stage is an example of stage or in method or respectively in that the outlier s are an example of incongruous data. In some embodiments the data points which would be considered outliers are those data points which have greater calculated probability of belonging to one of the subgroups corresponding to one of the abnormal Gaussian components than to the normal Gaussian component. Depending on the embodiment the normal versus abnormal Gaussian components may be differentiated using various suitable procedures.

In one procedure the mixing fraction calculated in the last iteration for each of the sub groups which reflects the amplitude of the corresponding Gaussian component can be used as the basis of deciding which of the components is the normal component. For instance it may be assumed in some of these embodiments that the normal Gaussian component is the dominant one associated with the largest number of data points and therefore with the largest mixing fraction .

In another procedure additionally or alternatively the normal versus abnormal Gaussian components may be differentiated based on degree of similarity to a Gaussian unimodal distribution of data points where there is no suspected misalignment for instance a distribution computed using a group of data points corresponding to probes or socket contacts known to be aligned a group of data points where there is no incongruity or which exclude any incongruous data points a distribution computed using a group of data points where the unimodal model was considered more appropriate in stage etc . In these cases there are various statistical methods which can be used for performing a test of similarity between two Gaussian distributions such as the well known Student T Test .

Additionally or alternatively in another procedure relevant to wafer testing the normal versus abnormal Gaussian components may be differentiated based on the degree of similarity to a reference misaligned data set deliberately generated by probing in a misaligned condition so as to produce a reference data incongruous with data produced when probing in a non misaligned condition. For example in some embodiments in which Z dimension overdrive is of particular concern a detailed characterization of the Cres distribution as a function of Z overdrive is performed in which the characterization data may serve as a reference for determining which of the subpopulations detected are derived from usual desirable probe conditions versus conditions that are unusual undesirable. Continuing with the example in such characterizations deliberately applying excessive overdrive and therefore probe force may result in a Cres distribution with lower values and smaller standard deviation than seen at the nominal overdrive setting. The Cres distribution which corresponds to the excessive overdrive condition may in some cases serve as a reference misaligned data set. In these cases the subpopulation data which is statistically consistent with the misaligned reference data set corresponding to an overdrive characterization and therefore incongruous with a non misaligned data set would be classified as outlier s and therefore the corresponding probes as suspected misaligned . Similarly in bondpad technologies utilizing a metal stack construction such as bondpads based on copper metallurgy capped by an aluminum alloy excessive overdrive may result in the probe penetrating the top layer metallization to directly contact the underlying bondpad metal producing a subpopulation of Cres data distinct from the nominal population and inherently different than nominal due to the different probe bondpad metal contact interface after penetration. Although in some other cases a distribution of lower Cres values with a smaller standard deviation may be electrically desirable in such embodiments the concern over physical damage to the bondpads and or to the probes caused by excessive force is the motivation for indicating misalignment and terminating the probe operation.

In some embodiments the likelihood ratio discussed above is an attribute or one of the attributes which is used in making a decision on indication of misalignment.

Although embodiments of the invention do not limit applications of the above described methods and systems some examples relating to wafer testing will now be provided for further illustration to the reader. These examples will be based on the data shown in which is a graph of CRES measurements by touchdown number for three pins i.e. bondpads Pin Pin and Pin according to some embodiments of the invention. The measurements may have been generated for example using Monte Carlo procedures.

In the illustrated embodiments in one example statistical method described above with reference to is applied to the Pin CRES data of . Examples of the Likelihood Ratio calculated from the cumulative Pin data at the 70 90 and 110touchdown are shown in and respectively along with histograms of the CRES data included in the Likelihood Ratio calculation at those points according to some embodiments of the invention. It is assumed in this example that beginning with touchdown and then after each 20 touchdowns stage triggers. After stage has triggered analysis of cumulative data for pin is performed as a group in stages to using method Possibly an analysis of cumulative data for other pins each group having data from a single pin is also performed . It can be seen in that at the 70touchdown just prior to the beginning of an upward trend of the Pin CRES data a Likelihood Ratio of 2.642684 is found. In after the Pin CRES values have started trending up the bimodality of the data becomes apparent in the histogram and the Likelihood Ratio has increased to 3.452825. In conditions have continued to worsen with increasing bimodality seen in the histogram and the Likelihood Ratio has increased to 4.079738.

Continuing with this example illustrates the histogram of overlaid by two possible Gaussian components which could be used to model the CRES measurements according to some embodiments of the invention. In some embodiments the area under each of the Gaussian curves is proportional to the expected number of data points associated with that curve and the relative fraction of data points associated with each is the mixing fraction. In these embodiments roughly 70 data points are associated with the curve with the higher mean frequency and 40 data points are associated with the curve with the lower mean frequency giving mixing fraction values of 70 110 and 40 110 or 0.64 and 0.36 respectively.

Assume in another example that stage triggers after each touchdown. In this example cumulative data from all preceding touchdowns for each of Pin Pin and Pin is analyzed as a group using method possibly an analysis of cumulative data for other pins each group having data from a single pin is also performed . For instance calculations of the Likelihood Ratio using cumulative data within the first 70 touchdowns for each of Pin Pin and Pin are shown in according to some embodiments of the present invention. Since in these embodiments it is assumed that for the first 70 touchdowns the unimodal model is appropriate for each of the three pins the calculation of the Likelihood Ratio within the first 70 touchdowns may in some cases provide an indication of what may be an appropriate threshold in making a decision to indicate misalignment. With such nominal data the maximum Likelihood Ratio calculated has a value around 3 suggesting sufficient margin if a threshold were set to be for instance near the value of around 3.5 i.e. set for instance to the Likelihood Ratio which was calculated using the data of .

In some embodiments other procedures can be implemented in performing stages to additionally or alternatively to method described above with reference to .

An example of another procedure is now given not in order to limit applications of other procedures but to further illustrate embodiments of the invention to the reader. Referring again to the data of for pins and histograms for the combined dataset of Pin Pin and Pin are shown for the first 70 touchdowns touchdowns to and touchdown to in and respectively according to some embodiments of the invention. For example it may be assumed that the three pins are similar enough that data relating to the three pins may be analyzed together.

In the illustrated embodiments of this example it is assumed that the distribution is normal and similar for all material and therefore suitable historical data representative of normal CRES distributions may be used as a reference. In this example assuming the CRES distribution of is normal a model normal distribution with mean of 2.13 ohms and standard deviation of 0.72 ohms may be used as a basis for identification of subsequent points with statistically unlikely high CRES values for example those with values greater than the mean plus three standard deviations or 4.3 ohms for the example data group of . In excursions the CRES data distribution will be composed of one or more subdivisions as shown in and continuing in . Based on the calculated threshold of the present example the data associated with the high CRES values on the right hand side of the histogram are easily distinguished based on CRES values greater than 4.3 ohms.

Referring again to beginning at the dashed vertical line marking touchdown number Pin begins to exhibit elevated CRES values with most Pin values beyond that touchdown falling above 4.3 ohms.

As an aside it is noted that in some cases a clean rather than a misalignment problem may be distinguished by a unimodal distribution with a higher mean CRES than in earlier touchdowns. Refer to which shows histograms for the combined dataset of Pin Pin and Pin when cleaning is due to remove material buildup on probe tips according to some embodiments of the invention. It is evident that compared to the normal CRES distribution of the mean CRES in is higher but the distribution remains unimodal hinting that the entire probe population has become contaminated.

In another example of a procedure which can additionally or alternatively be implemented in performing stages to a parametric statistical analysis of CRES data may be used to distinguish sub populations of pins with unusually low or high mean values or unusually narrow or wide standard deviations. These subpopulations can potentially correlate with individual probes or groups of probes with misalignment problems.

In still another example of a procedure which can additionally or alternatively be implemented a rolling average of CRES measurements may be maintained for example for each pin over a certain number of touchdowns. Continuing with the example stage may be triggered after each touchdown with the rolling average analysis performed in stage on data from the last predetermined number of touchdowns. Refer to which illustrates rolling average CRES measurements for the most recent 16 touchdowns for Pin Pin and Pin by touchdown using the data from according to some embodiments of the invention. The dashed vertical line corresponds to touchdown . It can be seen that the rolling average of Pin diverges from the rolling averages of the other two pins going above 3 ohms whereas the rolling averages of the other two pins stay pretty constant. Refer also to which illustrates calculated CRES standard deviation based on a rolling 20 point 20 touchdown window for the data from on Pin according to some embodiments of the invention. It can be seen that there is a dramatic increase in standard deviation around touchdown and again around touchdown . These increases occur approximately at the touchdowns where the data in the rolling 20 point window includes both the older better CRES and the newer worse CRES data points.

In still another example of a procedure which can additionally or alternatively be implemented a body of reference data may be accrued over time. For instance CRES data relating to one or more individual probes from a rolling window of a certain number of consecutive touchdowns may be acquired with the cumulative data set treated as the reference distribution.

Continuing with the examples based on the data of after using method and or any other procedure for performing stages to and then performing stages and and or after performing stages to attribute determination can be performed in stage . In some embodiments attribute determination includes determination of incidence of a probe being identified as suspected misaligned. Illustrating such an embodiment again with the data of and applying a CRES threshold of e.g. 4.3 ohms it can be seen that the incidence counter for Pin would be incremented only once due to a single measurement of about 5.0 ohms at touchdown incidence 1 1 while the incidence counter for Pin would be incremented in almost every touchdown subsequent to touchdown . Therefore in these embodiments attribute determination would include one incidence of Pin being identified as suspected misaligned and multiple incidences of Pin being identified as suspected misaligned. In some embodiments additionally or alternatively attribute determination includes trend analysis. For instance referring again to the upward trend for Pin compared to Pins and is evident. Any other attribute determination including inter alia position attribute determination may additionally or alternatively be performed in any of the above examples which were based on the data of .

Continuing with the examples based on the data of any type of misalignment indication condition may be evaluated in stage . Although the type of condition is not limited for further illustration to the reader some instances are now provided. For instance in some embodiments a decision to indicate misalignment may be made when the Likelihood Ratio is at or above 3.5 or when the Likelihood Ratio is above 3.5 and other condition s have been met. In another instance additionally or alternatively a condition may require that the average CRES value of identified suspected misaligned probes exceeds a predetermined value or a value threshold relative to the average CRES value of probes which have not been identified as suspected misaligned. Continuing with this instance in some cases of the data of a decision to indicate misalignment may be made if the average CRES value of identified suspected misaligned probes exceeds e.g. 3 ohms or exceeds e.g. the mean plus four standard deviations of the distribution of CRES values from probes not identified as suspected misaligned. In another instance additionally or alternatively in some cases of the data of because the distribution is unimodal there may be a decision not to indicate misalignment.

As mentioned above with reference to stage and in some embodiments position attribute s may be determined and in some of these embodiments the determination may include spatial analysis. is a flowchart of an example of a method of determining position attribute s which includes spatial analysis according to some embodiments of the invention. In some embodiments position analyzer performs method . In some embodiments of the invention method is performed by parametric analyzer . In some embodiments stages which are shown in as being executed sequentially may be executed in parallel. In some embodiments method may include more less and or different stages than illustrated in . In some embodiments stages may be executed in a different order than illustrated in .

In the illustrated embodiments in optional stage it is determined if there are sufficient identified suspected misaligned probes to perform a spatial analysis. If there are sufficient identified suspected misaligned probes yes to stage then method proceeds to stage . If there are not sufficient identified suspected misaligned probes no to stage then method concludes in stage that a definitive position attribute may not be determined by method and therefore ends.

In some embodiments there may not be a minimum number of suspected misaligned probes needed to perform a spatial analysis and stages and may be omitted.

In stage a first template is provided. Depending on the embodiment template used as a first or subsequent template may represent any contiguous or non contiguous area on one or more wafers as described in more detail above. Depending on the embodiment the selection of template used as the first template or as a subsequent template may or may not be based on the type of data and or anticipated misalignment problem etc. as described in more detail above. Although method shows that if there is a plurality of templates the templates are consecutively applied in other embodiments with a plurality of templates some or all of the templates may be applied in parallel.

In the illustrated embodiments in stage a set of identified suspected misaligned probes is mapped to the template. Depending on the embodiment the set of identified suspected misaligned probes may include all identified suspected misaligned probes from stages or may include only some of the identified suspected misaligned probes. As an example of the latter embodiment in some cases where different templates represent different touchdowns suspected misaligned probes may be divided into different sets based on the position of the touchdown on the wafer when the testing data which was used for identifying the suspected misalignment was generated. In some embodiments where a probe which was assigned multiple times to a template is included in the set of suspected misaligned probes the mapping of the probe to the template may include the same number of mappings as assignments or may include less. For instance the number of mappings may be less if only data corresponding to the probe being positioned in some of the locations represented by the various assignments leads to suspected misaligned identification. Continuing with an example of this instance a probe s data may be referenced N times in a template for example if the template includes N touchdowns and each of those touchdowns includes that probe. However in this example if the probe has been classified as suspect in less than N touchdowns the number of mappings may be less than N.

In the illustrated embodiments in stage spatial analysis is performed in order to determine position attribute s for the set of identified suspected misaligned probes. In some embodiments spatial analysis calculates one or more metrics which quantifies the placement of the set of identified suspected misaligned probes with respect to a contiguous or non contiguous area on one or more wafers represented by template . For example the spatial analysis may include calculation of one or more spatial density metrics for each region of template such as spatial probability count percentage ratios etc and in this example spatial density per region is a type of position attribute. Continuing with the example for the case of spatial probabilities in some embodiments the expected density of suspected misaligned probes in all template regions is assumed to be the same approximated as the total number of suspected misaligned probes in all template regions combined divided by the total number of probes within all template regions combined including both suspected misaligned probes as well as those that are not suspected misaligned probes . Given this calculated average suspect misaligned probe spatial density in these embodiments a statistical model is then used to calculate the probability of the occurrence of the actual observed number of suspect misaligned probes within each region of the template. If the calculated probability of the observations within one or more of the template regions is very low which may for example be determined by comparison to a predefined limit then the conclusion is that the actual suspected misaligned probe spatial density of those template regions is either significantly higher or significantly lower than the expected suspected misaligned probe spatial density. In other embodiments of this example a statistical model may be used to compare the spatial densities of the expected to the actual identified suspected misaligned probes when the expected identified suspected misaligned probe spatial densities in each region of the template is not equal to the average suspected misaligned probe densities of all regions combined as described above but rather a variation in the densities between regions is expected and is included in the statistical calculation. In some embodiments of the statistical calculations described here the comparison of the probability of the actual number of suspected misaligned probes within each region to a predefined limit based on the probability of observing an expected suspected misaligned probe number within a region may be based on a cumulative probability density function in which the calculated probabilities and corresponding predefined limits are based on the occurrence of k or fewer or k or greater suspected misaligned probes within a region rather than on the occurrence of exactly k suspected misaligned probes . Therefore depending on the embodiment of the example calculated spatial probabilities may or may not be cumulative. Any appropriate statistical model can be used in this example in various embodiments including binomial for 2 regions where the spatial probabilities are binomial probabilities higher nomial statistics hypergeometric Poisson negative binomial trinomial higher nomial geometric distribution etc. It is noted that in some cases of this example assuming that the expected distribution is random the spatial analysis yields for a region a very high or very low spatial probability when it is more likely that the identified suspected misaligned probes are not randomly distributed among the regions but rather the distribution is systematic . It is also noted that in some cases of this example assuming that the expected distribution is random it can be concluded that there is clustering of identified suspected misaligned probes in template region s with high spatial probability for example corresponding to section s of a touchdown and or of a wafer etc. In another example with spatial densities the spatial analysis may include additionally or alternatively a simple count of the number of suspected misaligned probes per region. In this example the count per region the count per region as a percentage or ratio of the number of identified suspected misaligned probes the count per region as percentage or ratio of that a nominal reference region and or any other type of function of count per region may be a type of position attribute. In another example additionally or alternatively spatial analysis may include calculation of spatial variation for instance by calculating the position of a centroid or center of gravity of identified suspected misaligned probe locations in order to identify if there is systematic spatial variation and in this example spatial variation is a type of position attribute.

In the illustrated embodiments in stage it is determined if there is another template to examine. Depending on the embodiment there may be any number of templates 1 . If there is another template yes to stage then method iterates for a next template stage beginning with stage . Depending on the embodiment the same set of identified suspected misaligned probes or a different set with or without overlapping members may be mapped to the template. If there is no other template no to stage then method ends.

Depending on the embodiment with method the position attribute s derived by method may be used in any manner or may not be used at all in deciding whether or not misalignment indication condition has been met in stage . For example in some embodiments condition may require solely or in combination with other factors that distribution of identified misaligned probes is unlikely to be random and is therefore likely to be systematic . Continuing with the example in some of these embodiments distributions of suspected misaligned probes that are unlikely to be random may in some cases be demonstrated by spatial probabilities for regions on a template or for regions on each of a plurality of templates that are above a predetermined floor and or below a predetermined ceiling. As another example in some embodiments additionally or alternatively condition may require solely or in combination with other factors that the number of suspected misaligned probes per region the number per region as a percentage or ratio of the number of identified suspected misaligned probes the number per region as a percentage or ratio of that of a nominal reference region or similar calculation be above a predetermined floor and or below a predetermined ceiling. As another example in some embodiments additionally or alternatively condition may depend solely or in combination with other factors on which touchdown section s the identified suspected misaligned probes are clustered and or on which wafer section s the identified suspected misaligned probes are clustered etc. As another example in some embodiments condition may be vary depending on whether or not the distribution is likely to be random for instance with a different combination of attribute s required to be met for a distribution of suspected misaligned probes likely to be random than one likely to be systematic.

Although embodiments of the invention do not limit applications of the above described methods and systems some examples will now be provided for further illustration to the reader which include position attribute determination.

One example is based on . is a chart of probe misalignment offset from zero misalignment in the X or Y direction for a probe array where the misalignment values by probe location are random and the distribution of misalignment values is Gaussian according to some embodiments of the present invention. In chart the probe array includes 672 probes and it is assumed that 42 dies with 16 pins each can be tested in parallel in a touchdown. The shown offsets may be the initial offsets prior to beginning testing or may be representative of a point in time during testing. It is noted that in a case where there is a drift in the negative direction probes with negative offset such as probe are at a greater risk of eventually falling off the bondpads and probing the bondpad edge or the passivation rather than those with a positive offset . On the other hand if there is drift in the positive direction probes with positive offset such as probe are at a greater risk of eventually falling off the bondpads and probing the bondpad edge or the passivation rather than those with a negative offset .

A second example is based on . is a chart of probe misalignment offset from zero misalignment in the X or Y direction for a probe array where the misalignment values by probe location are not random according to some embodiments of the present invention. Probes near the top of the probe array and especially at the northeast corner are systematically skewed with negative misalignment. In chart the probe array also includes 672 probes and it is assumed that 42 dies with 16 pins each can be tested in parallel in a touchdown. The shown offsets may be the initial offsets prior to beginning testing or may be representative of a point in time during testing. It is noted that in a case where there is a drift in the negative direction probes with negative offset such as probe are at a greater risk of eventually falling off the bondpads and probing the bondpad edge or the passivation rather than those with a positive misalignment offset . On the other hand if there is drift in the positive direction probes with positive offset such as probe are at a greatest risk of eventually falling off the bondpads and probing the bondpad edge or the passivation rather than those with a negative offset .

The examples discussed below relate to X or Y misalignment because charts and show offsets in the X or Y dimension. However the examples could additionally or alternatively relate to misalignment in the Z or theta dimension.

In these examples in stages CRES data are measured for all pins of each DUT and or an opens test is executed optionally along with other tests of the test flow. The CRES data and pin level opens failure data are generated in stage and made accessible in stage .

In order to simplify the examples it is assumed that completion of testing of a touchdown or a plurality of touchdowns acts as a trigger in stage .

In some embodiments of these examples it is assumed that without having to perform a statistical analysis of parametric data suspected misaligned probes are identified using pass fail test s sensitive to misalignment such as the OPENs test in stages to .

In some of embodiments of the first example using chart and based on the offsets listed and an assumed negative drift it is assumed that the bondpad associated with the probe with the largest negative offset would be identified as suspected misaligned first due to failing first the pass fail test and then the bondpad associated with the probe with the next largest negative offset would be identified as suspected misaligned second due to failing second the pass fail test etc. Based on these assumptions the bondpad associated with the probe with offset would be identified as suspected misaligned first then the bondpad associated with the probe with offset next then the bondpad associated with the probe with offset next followed by the bondpad associated with the probe with offset followed by the bondpad associated with the probe with offset followed by the bondpad associated with the probe with offset followed by the bondpad associated with the probe with offset followed by the bondpad associated with the probe with offset followed by the bondpad associated with the probe with offset and followed by the bondpad associated with probe with offset . It is noted that the probes are labeled so that the reader can more easily follow the remainder of the discussion.

In some of embodiments of the second example using instead chart and based on the offsets listed and an assumed negative drift it is assumed that the bondpad associated with the probe with the largest negative offset would be identified as suspected misaligned first due to failing first the pass fail test and then the bondpad associated with the probe with the next largest negative offset would be identified as suspected misaligned second due to failing second the pass fail test etc. Based on these assumptions the bondpad associated with the probe with offset would be identified as suspected misaligned first then the bondpad associated with the probe with offset next then the bondpad associated with the probe with offset next followed by the bondpad associated with the probe with offset followed by the bondpad associated with the probe with offset followed by the bondpad associated with the probe with offset followed by the bondpad associated with the probe with offset followed by the bondpad associated with the probe with offset followed by the bondpad associated with the probe with offset and followed by the bondpad associated with probe with offset . It is noted that the probes are labeled so that the reader can more easily follow the remainder of the discussion.

In some embodiments of these examples additionally or alternatively some or all of suspected misaligned probes listed above may be identified in stages to using parametric data for instance CRES measurements. For example assume that after each touchdown the data of all 672 pins from that touchdown are analyzed together in one group or in separate groups for example depending on electrical and or physical characteristics of the pins. In this case since the analysis is performed after each touchdown timing of when the suspected misaligned probes are identified as suspected misaligned is accurate to the touchdown level. However in some embodiments the data of the pins from a range of a plurality of touchdowns may be analyzed together in one group or in separate groups for example dependent on electrical and or physical characteristics of the pins and in these embodiments the timing is accurate to the touchdown range.

In some embodiments of these examples in stage the determination of attribute s for a set of identified suspected misaligned probes includes at least the determination of position attribute s using spatial analysis for example as described above with reference to method of . In some embodiments of these examples it is assumed that the determination of position attribute s is performed after enough touchdowns have been completed for there to be sufficient identified misaligned probes to perform a spatial analysis.

In some embodiments of these examples user defined location template s are applied for instance in stage . For simplicity of description it is assumed that each template represents a touchdown and each template is divided into geometric regions that are anticipated to display enhanced suspected misaligned probe density in the event of the misalignment mechanisms being considered. An illustration of a simple series of four such templates is shown in each of for the first and second example respectively according to some embodiments of the invention. In these figures each of the eight templates is shown in a separate figure namely B C and D for the first example and B C and D for the second example and each template divides the probe array into two regions containing approximately equal numbers of probes. In some cases additional or different regions may be identified within the probe arrays of the user defined series of location templates.

In some embodiments of these examples referencing the probe offset scenario of the first example in the set of probes which are likely to be identified as suspected misaligned in the case of negative drift as discussed above is mapped onto each of the templates of comprising B C and in stage . Similarly referencing the probe offset scenario of the second example in the set of probes which are likely to be identified as suspected misaligned in the case of negative drift as discussed above is mapped onto each of the templates of comprising B C and D in stage . Each suspected misaligned probe is numbered in comprising B C and D and comprising B C and D in the order in which identification as suspected misaligned in the given scenario would be expected to occur. It is assumed for simplicity of description that with gradually worsening probe alignment the sequence in which the indicated probes are identified as suspected misaligned can be surmised based on the probe offset values of and as discussed above.

In some embodiments of these examples a numerical or statistical comparison of the density of the identified suspected misaligned probes occurring in the defined regions of each location template is performed as part of the spatial analysis of stage in order to determine if the density is statistically higher in one region that the other s or equivalently if the number of identified suspected misaligned probes for any given user defined region is statistically unlikely either too few or too many given the total number of suspect probes from across the entire probe array. The results of this spatial analysis indicate the nature of any non uniformity of identified suspected misaligned probe locations which may be used subsequently as a criterion for deciding on misalignment indication.

It is noted that in some embodiments of these examples if a drift in probe alignment occurs as probing progresses the location of the probes exhibiting abnormal CRES measurements may be a random or systematic in nature. In the illustrated embodiments of this example it is assumed that the statistical model used for comparing the densities is a binomial model and that cumulative binomial probabilities an example of spatial probabilities described above are therefore calculated. and show cumulative binomial probabilities for the random pattern in the first example and a systematic pattern in the second example respectively according to some embodiments of the invention. Referring first to the raw data shown on the left side of are derived from and showing for regions A and B of each the number and sequence of probes being identified as suspected misaligned up to point where the first ten suspected misaligned probes have been so identified. The left side of has a similar meaning based on data derived from and

In the illustrated embodiments of these examples in and the column with heading labeled Average Bad Probe Density indicates the fraction of probes within the probe array that have been identified as suspected misaligned. Thus in the first example in at the point of identification of the first suspected misaligned probe the fraction is 1 672 for a density of 0.001488 and at the point of the identification of the tenth suspected misaligned probe the fraction is 10 672 for a density of 0.01488. As the intermediate suspect probes appear the listed average suspect probe densities are calculated similarly. For simplicity and the convenience of this example as mentioned above each of the four user defined regions contain the same number of probes with 336 probes each for region A and region B as indicated in the row labeled probes region . In general this need not be the case.

In some embodiments of the first and second example in and respectively the columns of the right hand table are the calculated cumulative probabilities of observing the number of suspected misaligned probes found within the various user defined regions based on binomial statistics. In some of these embodiments the cumulative binomial probability of getting k or fewer suspected misaligned probes in one region out of n probes in the probe array is given by 

Referring for example to the bottom row of probabilities in that have been calculated for the Region A regions of the four templates reading 44 probability 26 probability 44 probability and 44 probability one finds the probability of those regions containing 4 or fewer suspect probes i.e. 44 and 3 or fewer suspect probes i.e. 26 out of the 336 total probes contained within each region at the calculated overall Average Bad Probe Density value of 0.01488. In the present example a lower probability value indicates that fewer suspect probes have been observed within the region than would be expected at the given Average Bad Probe Density.

In some embodiments of the first example as the data of and B C and D are derived from a spatially random series of initial probe offsets as shown in the probabilities associated with regions A and B of the four templates are only slightly polarized. The lowest probability value of 9 probability is associated with region A of at the point at which a total of 8 total suspected misaligned probes have been identified with only one located in region A versus 7 suspect probes within region B . Inspection of the location of the first ten suspect probes in confirms that there is some tendency for more to fall in the bottom half of the probe array region B than in the top half region A .

In some embodiment of the second example the data of and B C and D by comparison are derived from a set of initial probe offsets that are far less spatially random shown in . Thus the probabilities associated with regions A and B of the four templates in this example are highly polarized. The lowest probability values of 1 probabilities and are associated with region B of at the point at which a total of 10 total suspect probes have been identified. In this example none of the suspected misaligned probes are found to be located in the bottom half region B of or in the south east corner of the probe array region B of which is a very improbable result if a spatially random suspect probe distribution is given. A low probability value of 4 probability is also found for the south west corner of the probe array region A of . Inspection of the location of the first ten suspect probes in confirms that there is a very strong tendency for suspect probes to appear in the upper half of the probe array than in the lower half.

In some embodiments of these examples it is assumed that attribute determination in stage also includes incidence of each probe being identified as suspected misaligned. For instance if data from each touchdown is analyzed separately incidence may in some cases refer to the number of touchdowns in which the analyzed data leads to an identification of a probe as suspected misaligned.

In some embodiments of these examples the decision on whether condition for indication of misalignment has been met in stage depends at least partly on the calculated cumulative binomial probabilities. Additionally or alternatively the decision can be a function of other attribute s such as the number of probes identified as suspected misaligned the values of the incidence counters rolling time average CRES associated with suspected misaligned probes etc.

In some embodiments of these examples a primary criterion required for indicating misalignment is greater than or equal to 6 probes identified as suspected misaligned that is the cumulative total of identified unique suspected misaligned probes is six or greater and with 3 or more of these identified suspected misaligned probes having incident counter values greater than or equal to 2 that is at least three probes having been identified as suspected misaligned probes at least twice suggesting consistency . Further for example a secondary criterion may be applied to assign a signature of a systematic probe alignment problem to the probing problem if the probability of suspect probe location configuration for any or combination of region in a user defined spatial template is say 5 or less at the average bad probe density calculated when 6 probes have been identified as suspected misaligned of which 3 were identified twice. In the present examples if a probing problem has been determined by the primary criterion to exist but a systematic probe alignment problem has not been determined by the secondary criterion then the signature of the probing problem may in some cases be designated as random .

In some embodiments of the first example applying these hypothetical criteria to the data of and assuming that the given incident counter criterion of consistency of failure for at least three probes twice has been fulfilled it can be seen that the nature of the suspected misalignment can be analyzed when 6 probes have been identified as suspected misaligned. Given the spatial templates applied and probability calculations at this point the minimum probability of 20 probabilities and would exceed the 5 probability required for designating the problem as systematic and thus would be designated instead as random . In contrast in some embodiments of the second example based on the data of at the point when 6 probes have been identified as suspected misaligned the positional analysis reveals that three regions exhibit probabilities of 5 or less probabilities and causing the probing problem to be designated as systematic .

In some embodiments of these examples in cases where the probing problem has been designated as random there may be additional criteria stipulated by condition to indicate misalignment than when the probing problem has been designated as systematic. For instance if a probing problem has been determined to be random in nature then in some cases the additional criteria may include an average CRES value of probes identified as suspected misaligned exceeding a fixed value and or exceeding a value threshold relative to the average CRES value of probes which have not been identified as suspected misaligned. Similarly in some embodiments of these examples in cases where the probing problem has been designated as systematic there may be less criteria stipulated in condition to indicate misalignment than when the probing problem has been designated as random. For instance systematic classification may be sufficient reason to indicate misalignment and no additional attribute s evaluation may be required.

In other examples method proceeds as in the first and second example described above. However these examples separately track identified suspected misaligned probes for touchdowns in different sections of a wafer. In these examples templates may be defined that are touchdown specific that vary with the touchdown involved . Therefore in these embodiments the analysis of suspect probe positions as part of the attribute determination in stage is not performed for a cumulative series of suspect probe locations across all touchdowns of a wafer or series of wafers but performed rather on the suspected misaligned probe location data across multiple wafers cumulative for similarly located touchdowns. For instance if a probe alignment problem exhibits a specific dependence on the location being probed on a wafer in such a case the templates applied for positional analysis may need also to vary with the location being probed on a wafer i.e. touchdown location . illustrates a scenario in which templates are defined to highlight misalignment problems involving only probes that fall near the wafer edge according to some embodiments of the invention. In the templates highlight edge problems impacting the probabilities of becoming suspected misaligned in the labeled regions of each of the indicated touchdowns that overlap the wafer edge. shows the probecard being applied to the wafer in the labeled touchdown sequence to with probe array edges delineated by the heavy dashed lines. The edge of the wafer is indicated by the heavy solid line of the outer circle. It is noted that 12 of the 16 touchdowns in this example have associated with them a unique template for spatial analysis of wafer edge probing problems composed of the regions labeled by the letters A through L each bounded by the edges of the associated touchdown and by an arc at the wafer edge and an arc within the wafer interior. Region A is applied for analysis of Touchdown Region B for Touchdown and so on. As illustrated in this particular figure the templates within a given template series do not necessarily contain the same number of defined regions. For the template set illustrated in touchdown and consist only of a single region while the other twelve touchdowns each comprise two regions i.e. the labeled region and the region interior to the labeled region .

In these examples position attribute determination with respect to the defined regions of for a set of the identified suspected misaligned probes as part of stage may in some embodiments occur after each touchdown. In some of these embodiments the position attribute determination may be performed using data accumulated from similar touchdowns across multiple wafers. In some cases of these examples spatial probabilities are computed separately after each touchdown for the corresponding edge regions A through L and the corresponding unlabeled non edge interior regions. In other cases of these examples after a plurality of wafers have been tested spatial probabilities are computed separately for each edge region A through L and for each unlabeled non edge regions cumulatively across those wafers. In some embodiments of these examples the criteria for determining if misalignment indication condition has been met may involve comparing probabilities derived from the various edge regions A through L to the unlabeled non edge regions of these examples. In some embodiments of these examples the criteria for determining if a misalignment indication condition has been met may require combining the results of statistical analysis from several regions to establish a pattern spanning the entire wafer. For instance if only a few regions within a segment of the wafer edge are found to have systematically skewed probabilities perhaps indicating a wafer chuck and or probecard with a particular tilt causing one point at the wafer edge to be higher than the point at the opposite diagonal interpretation of the problem would be different than if all of the defined edge regions exhibit skewed probabilities.

The remainder of the description will focus on testing of packaged devices rather than devices contained on a wafer in die format.

Before describing in more details some embodiments of systems and methods of packaged device testing an overview will now be presented.

As mentioned above in packaged format temporary contact for testing purposes is made between test socket contacts and the pins of the packaged device. In some embodiments the form and structure of the package pins may vary depending on the embodiment as may the contacts of the package compatible test socket being used. There are myriad types of test sockets and of device packages however most or all have in common the need to establish extremely low resistance connections between individual package pins and the corresponding socket contacts. Thus these elements may in many cases take the form of tiny metallic pins formed leads balls and the like. When leads and contacts are clean properly socketed and well aligned each device pin and corresponding socket contact should touch one another with sufficient metal to metal cross sectional area overlap and sufficient force to allow for minimal contact resistance. Similar to the challenge of maintaining excellent probe to pad alignment during wafer probing the consistent alignment of pins to contacts while performing package test operations is made difficult by small package pin to pin pitch often less than 1 mm by the large number of pins within a package often several hundred in number and or by the repetitive mechanical stress associated with socketing unsocketing devices often involving tens of thousands of insertions during the lifetime of a socket . In test operations involving high temperature test conditions thermal stresses also come into play. In some cases the repetitive mechanical and thermal stresses a socket is subjected to during its normal use in manufacturing test operations may gradually cause socket elements to wear out eventually failing to comply with dimensional specifications and as a result may become prone to misalignment during packaged device insertions. In case of a misalignment event one or more of the device pins may not make contact with the corresponding package contact s with enough overlap area or force to produce the normal low contact resistance and may rather exhibit an elevated contact resistance. The condition may be electrically exhibited through a direct Cres measurement of the type described in more detail above and in some cases may in addition or instead be exhibited by other electrical measurements for example by a resistive drop in power supply voltages reaching the chip s internal Vdd bondpad or by an unusual RC delay in a high speed signal path.

In a high volume test manufacturing operation automated handling equipment AKA handler is used to insert the packaged parts into sockets on test loadboards prior to the testing and to remove them after testing has been completed. In some embodiments parallel test hardware is provided permitting simultaneous testing of multiple packaged devices seated in multiple sockets at the same time. Whether socketing and testing packaged devices individually or performing socketing and testing in a multiple device parallel fashion any misalignment between the package s and the socket s has the potential of causing an electrically measurable aberration. For example insertion of devices into sockets with inadvertent tilt in the Z dimension could cause the device pins that have not been inserted deeply enough into the socket to exhibit increased contact resistance because of reduced cross sectional area contact with socket contacts and or due to reduced pin to contact force. To provide another example with the wear on a socket that occurs over an extended use period the fit of packed parts within that socket could become less snug than required to guarantee consistent pin to contact connection on all pins. Misalignment in the X Y directions as well as rotational misalignment may eventually result. In this case some of the pins of devices inserted into that socket may suffer from electrical degradation during testing while others remain normal. To provide a final example with the wear on a socket that occurs over an extended use period random individual contacts within the socket may become physically deformed and or marginally misaligned eventually resulting in a poor electrical pin to contact connection on the corresponding device pins while remaining sound on pins corresponding to socket contacts that have not degraded. Given these examples a bimodality or multimodality in the distribution of relevant electrical measurements from the set of all pins within the package may in some cases occur and with traceability of the incongruous measurements to individual pin to contact positions within the packaged device and socket suspected misaligned contacts can be logged. In addition given these examples it is expected that if the misalignment described becomes severe the devices being tested may in some cases actually fail tests within the test flow with known pin continuity sensitivity such as opens and the identity of the associated failing contacts may also be logged.

In some embodiments the communication between handler and other modules of system for example with tester in via channel A or with misalignment indication decision system in via channel B may occur in some cases via any suitable channel including inter alia parallel digital communication RS 232 serial communication a Transmission Control Protocol Internet Protocol TCP IP network a GPIB bus General Purpose Interface Bus also known as a IEEE 488 or HP IB bus Hewlett Packard Instrument Bus a Universal Serial Bus USB an IEEE 1394 Interface any appropriate channel using high speed electronic communication technology etc.

In some embodiments the communication between misalignment indication decision system and tester assuming different units is via any suitable channel including inter alia a local area network such as an Ethernet connection with a network protocol e.g. TCP IP a Universal Serial Bus USB an IEEE 1394 Interface any appropriate channel using high speed electronic communication technology etc.

In the illustrated embodiments tester applies electronic test sequences to packaged devices currently being tested also known as devices under test DUTs through a test program . Test program digitally controls tester electronics for generating physical test signals such as pin electronics cards pattern generator boards power supplies and the like to drive test signals and to provide power to all socket contacts in socket . Depending on the embodiment tester may support testing of multiple packaged devices in parallel and or testing each package device sequentially.

In the illustrated embodiments specification of the test content for example the desired signal transition timing voltage or current levels pass fail criteria vector data pattern selection vector data pattern sequences test subroutine and pattern content test flow sequencing and branching etc. is made through compiled or linked files constituting test program created for example using custom tester specific programming languages and a library of application programming interface API functions. In the illustrated embodiments the test content of test program includes pass fail test s and or parametric test s . A pass fail test is a single valued test which yields a single valued result indicating whether or not the tested value is greater than or in other testing less than a given value limit. If the tested value is greater than or less than the given limit the single valued result is failure but if not then the single valued result is pass . A parametric test yields a resulting measurement that can take on any of multiple values. Depending on the implementation the resulting measurement value for a particular parametric test may be provided by analog measurement equipment as part of testing electronics or may be honed in through the performance of a plurality of single valued tests. As an example of the latter implementation a series of single valued tests may be performed in which the given value limit is repeatedly varied until determination of a range of the actual measurement value to within the desired resolution. In some embodiments parametric test s include at least one or more different parametric tests whose resulting measurement values are sensitive to misalignment between contact s on socket and pin s on packaged device which is undergoing testing. In some embodiments additionally or alternatively pass fail test s include at least one or more different pass fail tests whose results are sensitive to misalignment between contact s on socket and pin s on packaged device which is undergoing testing.

In some embodiments commercially available testers used for electronic device testing operations today along with their operating systems may be adapted to become tester . As an example the Verigy HP93K tester or the Teradyne J750 tester may be considered typical of such commercially available systems.

In the illustrated embodiments tester electronics are electrically connected to the traces of loadboard on which socket is mounted while the contacts of socket for example composed of gold plated beryllium copper structures make temporary contact to the surface of the leads of packaged device currently being tested. The specific contact structures and contacting mechanisms depend on package technology. Metal socket contacts may be variously formed as metal springs such as helical springs or as Pogo Pins as thin metal beams or as metal fingers clips or clamps to name a few examples. Contacting mechanisms in some package technologies may involve a simple insertion of packaged device into receiving socket while others for example may involve application of a clamping mechanism to maintain adequate lead to socket contact force after insertion has occurred. The socket contacts provide a mechanical and electrical interface through which electrical signals and power supply voltages are applied to the device during testing and also pass voltage responses from the device back to the tester for evaluation for example via tester socket signal s . Socket may have as many as several hundred socket contacts attached for testing which may span an area of several centimeters.

In some embodiments tester may be the same tester as tester described with reference to system above for example a tester which is adapted to perform wafer testing and or packaged device testing. In other embodiments tester may be a different tester than tester .

In some embodiments each packaged device pin should be precisely positioned within the XY plane corresponding to the positions of the contacts of the socket and should also be positioned properly in the Z dimension such that the device pins all are within the plane of the socket contacts when the packaged device has been inserted for testing and should also be rotationally aligned. In some of these embodiments good electrical contact between socket contacts and pins can only be achieved when these socket contacts are positioned within a few micrometers of the centers of the associated pins while also being correctly positioned in the Z and theta dimensions. In some of these embodiments maintaining the correct alignment of each one of the hundreds of socket contacts involved without error or adjustment while hundreds of successive packaged devices are inserted in a semiconductor manufacturing packaged device testing operation is challenging.

In the illustrated embodiments misalignment indication decision system includes a suspected misaligned socket contact identifier configured to identify suspected misaligned socket contact s an attribute determiner configured to determine one or more attributes relating to identified suspected misaligned socket contact s a miscontact AKA suspected misaligned socket contact evaluator configured to evaluate the attribute s to decide whether or not a condition for indicating misalignment has been met and misalignment is to be indicated. In some embodiments misalignment indication decision system optionally also includes a distribution controller configured to distribute a misalignment indication a database configured to store a test data collection and or a look up table and or a processor manager configured to control the operation of one or more of the modules in misalignment indication decision system . Any of the modules in misalignment indication decision system may be made up of any combination of software hardware and or firmware that performs the functions as described and explained herein. In some embodiments misalignment indication decision system may comprise a machine specially constructed for the desired purposes and or may comprise a programmable machine selectively activated or reconfigured by specially constructed program code. In some embodiments misalignment indication decision system includes at least some hardware.

In some embodiments misalignment indication system may be the same system as misalignment indication system described with reference to system above for example a misalignment indication system which is adapted for wafer testing and or packaged device testing. In other embodiments misalignment indication system may be a different system than misalignment indication system . More specifically in some embodiments any of suspected misaligned socket contact identifier attribute determiner miscontact evaluator process manager distribution controller and or database may be the same element as suspected misaligned probe identifier attribute determiner misprobe evaluator process manager distribution controller and or database respectively described above adapted for wafer testing and or packaged device testing. In some other embodiments additionally or alternatively any of suspected misaligned socket contact identifier attribute determiner miscontact evaluator process manager distribution controller and or database may be a different element than suspected misaligned probe identifier attribute determiner misprobe evaluator process manager distribution controller and or database respectively.

In some embodiments misalignment indication decision system may include fewer more and or different modules than shown in and . For example in some of these embodiments part or all of database may be separated out of misalignment indication decision system for example included instead in tester or in a separate unit or may be omitted. As another example in some embodiments suspected misaligned socket contact identifier may be separated out of misalignment indication decision system . For instance in some embodiments there may be advantages to the identification provided by suspected misaligned socket contact identifier even when separated from the functionality of the remainder of system . In some embodiments the functionality of misalignment indication decision system may be divided differently than illustrated among the modules illustrated in and . In some embodiments misalignment indication decision system may include additional less and or different functionality than described herein. For example misalignment indication decision system may include additional functionality relating to testing and or support functionality for additional modules such as computer terminals networked test program servers and or networked data storage systems.

In the illustrated embodiments test data collection is shown stored in database but in some embodiments some or all of test data collection is made accessible to identifier without being stored in database or without being stored at all. Test data collection includes test results from parametric tests and or pass fail tests relevant to a current decision on whether or not to indicate misalignment for example results of parametric and or pass fail tests which are sensitive to misalignment . For pass fail tests only failing results may be included in test data collection or both passing and failing results may be included.

Embodiments of the current invention do not limit test data collection . However for the sake of further illustration to the reader some examples will now be presented. Assuming for simplicity of description that test data collection relates the single socket then possible examples of test data collection may include inter alia data over a plurality of packaged devices for a single socket contact data over a plurality of packaged devices for selected socket contact s data over a plurality of packaged devices for socket contact s previously identified as suspected misaligned data over a plurality of packaged devices for all socket contacts data from a single packaged device for selected socket contacts data from a single packaged device for all socket contacts etc.

In some embodiments the scope of test data collection varies depending on the type of misalignment indication decision to be made based on that test data collection. For example if looking for variation within a packaged device for instance due to individual misaligned socket contacts then in some cases a particular test data collection may include data from a single packaged device. As another example if looking for variation in successive packaged devices socketings for instance due to drift in one or more directions then in some cases a particular test data collection may include data from a plurality of packaged device socketings.

Depending on the embodiment the extent of test data collection may be defined a priori or may be dynamic. For example assume that n identified suspected misaligned socket contacts n 1 are required in order to make a useful misalignment indication decision. In this example test data collection needs to include sufficient test data to allow the identification of at least n suspected misaligned socket contacts. However since the amount of data which would be sufficient to allow identification of at least n suspected misaligned socket contacts is not known a priori the extent of test data collection may either be dynamic based on the real time identification or may be predefined to be sufficiently large so that identification of n suspected misaligned socket contacts n 1 is sufficiently probable to meet the demands of the implementation. In another example there may not be a requirement for n identified suspected misaligned socket contacts n 1 nor any other requirements which cannot be determined a priori and therefore in this example the extent of test data collection may be predefined. In another example if in a previous misalignment indication decision certain socket contact s were identified as suspected misaligned but the decision was not to indicate misalignment then test data collection s used for subsequent misalignment indication decisions may focus on data relating to those socket contact s identified as suspected misaligned. Similarly in this example current test data collection may additionally or alternatively be reduced as needed while identification of suspected misaligned socket contacts continues in order to focus on data relating to socket contacts identified as suspected misaligned. In this example the extent of a particular test data collection may therefore be dynamically changed based on the identity of previously identified suspected misaligned socket contacts. In another example the extent of a particular test data collection may be dynamically changed if a previous misalignment indication decision was borderline in order to allow for a more conclusive misalignment indication decision.

It is noted that depending on the embodiment only one test data collection may be accessible at a time or a plurality of test data collections each relevant for a different instance of a misalignment indication decision may be accessible at a time. In cases where a plurality of test data collections are accessible at a time the plurality may be accessed in parallel in order to make parallel misalignment decisions or the plurality may not be accessed at the same time. Assuming test data collection is stored on database then depending on the embodiment database may include only one data collection at a time or may include a plurality of data collections concurrently. Assuming different test data collections during the life of system which may or may not be accessible at the same time then depending on the embodiment each data collection which is used in a different decision on whether or not to indicate misalignment may include a unique set of data or each data collection does not necessarily include a unique set of data. As an example of the latter embodiment assuming each test data collection includes data from a plurality of packaged device socketings in a given socket each data collection may include data relating to distinct packaged device socketings or two or more data collections may include data relating to at least one of the same packaged device socketing.

In some embodiments of test data collection corresponding pins for test results are apparent. For example in some embodiments in packaged device testing system A handler may transfer identification data of the packaged device s currently being tested to tester for example identification data such as lot number packaged device number etc. may also be provided to tester . In these embodiments tester integrates test results with identification data so that the test results identified by identification data can become part of test data collection . As another example in some embodiments of packaged device testing system B misalignment indication decision system controls synchronization of testing and socketing and therefore is aware of identification data of the packaged device s currently being tested for example lot number packaged device number etc. Misalignment indication decision system can therefore integrate identification data with test results received from tester so that the test results identified by identification data can become part of test data collection . In various embodiments of either of the latter two examples corresponding pins for test results may be apparent because the test results are arranged in test data collection in a manner in which the corresponding pin is evident for example in consecutive order by pin number and or because the corresponding pin is explicitly indicated for each result.

In the illustrated embodiments database additionally or alternatively includes a look up table or an equivalent correspondence module which associates pins with socket contacts. For example in some cases look up table comprises any convenient system readable file format such as American Standard Code for Information Interchange ASCII that includes information indicating which pin corresponds to which socket contact. Depending on the embodiment look up table may be the same or may vary with test data collection . In some other embodiments look up table is included elsewhere in misalignment indication decision system . In some other embodiments the correspondence between pins and socket contacts is hardcoded.

In some embodiments look up table includes entries relating to various products tested by packaged device testing system and for each product that is tested table entries relating to that product are referenced. In some other embodiments each product that is tested by packaged device testing system has a unique associated look up table or is uniquely hardcoded. In embodiments with a look up table the product table entries may in some cases be differentiated by package type and or by the semiconductor device s contained within the package.

In some embodiments look up table includes other useful product specific information such as pin electrical and or physical characteristics including for example pin type pin layout and or pin device signal association etc. Additionally or alternatively in some of these embodiments look up table includes useful socket information such as physical characteristics of contacts. For example in some cases such product and or socket specific information may be used as a basis for grouping data for common analysis see for example description of stage below . In some other embodiments such product and or socket specific information is included in a separate lookup table which does not include pin to socket contact correspondence. In some other embodiments such product and or socket specific information is not used in deciding whether or not to indicate misalignment or such product and or socket specific information is hardcoded.

In some embodiments database may additionally or alternatively include other data for example test data irrelevant to misalignment etc.

Optionally suspected misaligned socket contact identifier includes a parametric analyzer configured to analyze parametric data in test data collection relating to misalignment and or a pass fail evaluator configured to evaluate pass fail data in test data collection relating to misalignment. In some embodiments with suspected parametric analyzer the analysis relates to determining whether or not there is data incongruity as will be discussed in more detail below.

Optionally attribute determiner includes a logger configured to log attribute s relating to suspected misaligned socket contact s . For example logger may log any of the following inter alia incidence e.g. number of times that a particular socket contact is identified as suspected misaligned the badness explained further below of a particular suspected misaligned socket contact incongruous parametric data the total number of and or fraction of identified suspected misaligned socket contact s within the socket the likelihood ratio e.g. as described above in tested packaged device during which a particular socket contact was identified each time as suspected misaligned statistical values derived from incongruous testing data parametric congruous testing data for example in order to provide a contrast electrical functionality of pin corresponding to particular identified suspected misaligned socket contact unusual physical characteristic of pin corresponding to particular identified suspected misaligned socket contact and or unusual physical characteristic of particular identified suspected misaligned socket contact physical positions of identified suspected misaligned socket contacts within the socket statistical values derived from congruous testing data statistical values derived from testing data of all socket contacts both those identified as suspected misaligned and those not so identified change in any of the above as a function of socketing iteration number of socketings since the last socket maintenance procedure socketing index and or trend etc. In various embodiments statistical values can include any appropriate statistical value such as for example mean median maximum minimum standard deviation and or rolling average etc.

In the illustrated embodiments miscontact evaluator includes misalignment indication condition so that miscontact evaluator can evaluate attribute s determined by attribute determiner singly and or in combination and decide whether or not a misalignment indication condition has been met. Depending on the embodiment condition may necessitate a particular attribute or combination of attributes or condition may be fulfilled by any of two or more stipulations where each stipulation requires a particular attribute or combination of attributes. Depending on the embodiment misalignment indication condition may be predetermined and or may be created and or adapted by system . If misalignment indication condition has been met then misalignment is to be indicated. For example in some embodiments miscontact evaluator provides a misalignment indication to distribution controller . Continuing with the example in system A distribution controller outputs a misalignment indication for example to an operator or engineering personnel e.g. indication and or to tester e.g. indication via channel with the indication optionally forwarded by tester to handler e.g. via channel A . Continuing with the example in system B distribution controller outputs a misalignment indication for example to an operator or engineering personnel e.g. indication to tester e.g. indication via channel and or to handler e.g. indication B via channel B . As another example in some embodiments distribution controller is omitted and any misalignment indication is outputted to an operator engineering personnel tester and or handler by miscontact evaluator . As another example distribution controller and miscontact evaluator may both output misalignment indications.

In some embodiments control of the operation of one or more of the modules in misalignment indication decision system by process manager includes triggering suspected misaligned socket contact identifier to attempt to identify if there are any suspected misaligned socket contacts. For example process manager may monitor the testing status and trigger attempts accordingly.

Optionally process manager includes a trigger configuration file . Trigger configuration file may comprise any convenient system readable file format such as ASCII which stipulates trigger point s within a test flow. In some cases trigger configuration file can also include any of the following specifications for each specified trigger point which test data collection to access see stage below how to group parametric data see stage below how to analyze a group of parametric data see stage method and other procedures for performing stage discussed below how to divide identified suspected misaligned socket contact s into set s for attribute determination see stage below which attributes to determine see stage below which misalignment indication condition to apply see stage below which misalignment indication decision to decide see stage below any combination of the above etc. In some cases a particular trigger point may trigger access to a plurality of test data collections in order to make a plurality of independent misalignment indication decisions and therefore in some of these cases one or more of the above specifications may need to be specified per test data collection for that trigger point. In cases where a particular trigger point triggers access to a plurality of test data collections in order to make a plurality of misalignment indication decisions the triggering may be performed consecutively or in parallel. In some embodiments some or all of the above specifications may not be included in configuration file for example because the specification is the same for each trigger point included in configuration file .

In some other embodiments process manager may be omitted and triggering point s for suspected misaligned socket contact identifier to attempt identification may be defined a priori for instance as a static set of default conditions embedded in the logic of system for example in suspected misaligned socket contact identifier and or other module s . In these embodiments specification s for each trigger point may in some cases also be embedded in the logic of system .

In the illustrated embodiments a first subprocess includes any of stages to . In the illustrated embodiments in stage socket contacts on socket make temporary contact with pins of a packaged device and tester executes a test program including for example one or more parametric tests and or one or more pass fail tests . Depending on the embodiment handler can perform any kind of maneuvering of the packaged device so that the pins make temporary contact with socket contacts on socket .

It is assumed that test program executed in stage includes at least one parametric test and or pass fail test whose result is sensitive to socket contact to pin misalignment in any dimension X Y Z or theta . Embodiments of the invention do not limit the types of parametric tests and or pass fail tests whose results are sensitive to misalignment but for the sake of further illustration to the reader some examples are now presented. One example of a parametric test that may reflect misalignment and or other issues is a contact resistance CRES test. Pins are typically formed out of metals or metal alloys in various shapes and sizes for example as formed metal leads or as solder coated balls or solder bumps attached to the underside of the package. Pins are typically surrounded by the package s bulk material which is composed of insulating materials such as preformed ceramics or moldable compounds such as epoxy cresol novolac polymer. Under good electrical contact between pins and socket contacts there would be some inherent contact resistance whose value would depend on one or more factors such as the pin and or socketing technology measurement procedure resistance definition for example including or excluding series resistance added by measurement fixturing etc. For example in some cases the inherent contact resistance may be less than 1 ohm whereas in other cases with different factor s the range may be about 2 to 3 ohms. Any type of misalignment which alters the socket contact to pin force e.g. too light or too heavy depending on Z alignment and or which causes the socket contact to incompletely contact the pin metal surface may have an impact on contact resistance. For example if the position of a socket contact is off target in the XY plane or is rotationally misaligned so that the socket contact incompletely contacts the pin metal surface and or partially or fully falls on the package insulating bulk material then higher than inherent contact resistance between socket contact and pin may result. Additionally or alternatively if the socket contact s tip position in the Z dimension is lower than the nominal socket contact tip position e.g. socket with tilt in the Z dimension causing some device pins to not be inserted deeply enough and therefore have reduced cross sectional area contact with socket contacts and or reduced contact to pin force then higher than inherent contact resistance between socket contact and pin may result. At an extreme instance if a socket contact lands completely off the pin but on the bulk package material instead the socket contact will not make electrical contact with the pin and the measured pin electrical contact resistance will be infinite optionally limited by tester overvoltage protection. It is noted that higher than inherent contact resistance can alternatively or additionally indicate other conditions in some embodiments such as a need for socket cleaning as socket contacts slowly become increasingly resistive with repeated use a damaged socket contact a socket contact blocked by a particle etc.

As another example a pass fail test which may be sensitive to misalignment is an opens test. A pin will fail the test typically if misalignment is severe although in some embodiments the opens test can be defined to fail for less severe misalignment. For example in some cases X Y and or theta misalignment and or Z alignment due to too little insertion force too little socket contact to pin force may cause an opens test failure. It is noted that in some embodiments a pin may additionally or alternatively fail an opens test due to other conditions such as a damaged socket contact a socket contact tip blocked by a particle etc.

Other examples of tests whose results may be sensitive to misalignment include pin leakage tests tests for a specific product whose results are affected by increases in contact resistance e.g. power supply drop on chip data latch etc a resistive drop in power supply voltages reaching the chip s internal Vdd bondpad an unusual RC delay in a high speed signal path etc.

In some embodiments at least one parametric test and or pass fail test whose result is sensitive to even slight socket contact to pin misalignment is included so that early detection of misalignment is possible.

In some embodiments not all tests which are sensitive to misalignment are performed. For example in some cases the tests which are performed may depend on the product. As another example in some cases the tests which are performed may depend on results of earlier performed tests. Continuing with the example and assuming that the opens test is scheduled before the contact resistance test in some of these cases if a pin failed an opens test contact resistance may not be measured for that pin.

In the illustrated embodiments in stage test data are generated. The test data can include results of tests performed in stage and generated by tester identification data of the packaged device currently being tested etc. As mentioned above identification data may be generated by handler by misalignment indication decision system and or otherwise.

Although the generation of test data and the format of the test data is not limited by embodiments of the invention for the sake of further illustration to the reader two examples are now given. In the first example where a device had eight input output pins that were submitted to the an opens test test data may include an index unit counter and the pass fail results in a format such as Unit 14 OPENS PPPFPPPP where the index of the unit under test is 14 the test is the opens test and of the eight pins the fourth failed and the rest passed the test. As another example assuming the same device with eight input output pins had contact resistance measured test data may include the index unit counter and the measurements in a format of Unit 14 CRES1.115 1.121 0.998 0.999 1.002 1.107 1.101 1.103 where CRES indicates that the test was contact resistance measurement.

In the illustrated embodiments in stage the generated test data is made accessible to identifier . For example in some embodiments generated test data may be stored in database so as to be accessible to identifier . As another example the generated test data may be passed to identifier for processing without storage.

In the illustrated embodiments in stage it is determined if testing has been completed. If testing has been completed then stages to are not repeated. If testing has not been completed then stages to are repeated for the next packaged device to be socketed in socket . The next packaged device may be from the same lot or from the next lot.

In the illustrated embodiments a second sub process of method including any of stages to illustrates possible stages in some embodiments for deciding whether or not to indicate misalignment. In some embodiments the second subprocess is performed by misalignment indication decision system . Embodiments of the invention do not limit the timing of the second subprocess in relation to the timing of the first subprocess. For example in some embodiments once the second subprocess has triggered in stage various remaining stages of the second subprocess may be performed without regard to which stages of the first subprocess are being performed. As another example in some embodiments additionally or alternatively once the second subprocess has triggered at least some of the remaining stages of the second subprocess are preferably performed between various passes of stage i.e. when no packaged device is currently being tested . As another example in some embodiments additionally or alternatively once the second subprocess has triggered at least some of the remaining stages of the second subprocess are preferably performed in parallel with stage i.e. when packaged device is actually being tested . As another example in some embodiments additionally or alternatively once the second subprocess has triggered at least some of the remaining stages of the second subprocess may be performed after testing has ended i.e. after a yes in stage 

In the illustrated embodiments in stage it is determined if a trigger occurred which causes the remaining stages of the second subprocess to be executed. If not method waits for a trigger. If a trigger has occurred then method proceeds to stage . In some embodiments process manager monitors the testing for example monitors subprocess to and triggers the remaining stages of the second subprocess in accordance with trigger configuration file described above. In some embodiments additionally or alternatively the remaining stages of the second subprocess are triggered according to a static set of default conditions integrated for example in suspected misaligned probe identifier and or other module s in misalignment indication decision system .

Embodiments of the invention do not limit the trigger s . However for the sake of further illustration to the reader some examples will now be presented. For example trigger point s can include any of the following material processing event s after each socketing after a plurality of devices have been processed through a socket after a plurality of lots have completed testing etc. As another example additionally or alternatively trigger point s can include event s not directly related to material processing such as amount of data in a system data buffer time of day time based event e.g. after every N hours of runtime shiftly daily weekly etc manufacturing based event metric such as after the first N devices have been tested following a handler set up conversion from Product Type A to Product Type B or when low yield has been observed on a series or set of devices tested on a given socket etc after a maintenance operation for example after every socket clean operation whenever misalignment indication decision system is available etc.

In some examples of trigger point s additionally or alternatively a specified trigger point for a particular misalignment indication is substantially soon after the required test data collection is complete. For instance in some of these examples after each socketing a decision for a type of misalignment which could be manifested within an individual socketing such as one or more socket contacts that are out of alignment may be triggered with test data collection possibly including data from that socketing. Additionally or alternatively for instance in some of these examples a decision for a type of misalignment which could be manifested after a plurality of socketings such as a gradual continuous drift from time zero in one or more directions monotonically getting worse in X Y Z and or theta dimension may be triggered after a plurality of socketings with test data collection possibly including data from those socketings. However in some other examples of trigger point s additionally or alternatively a specified trigger point may be at a point later in time than when the test data collection needed for the misalignment indication decision is complete. For instance a trigger point may be deferred in order to postpone the analysis necessary for the misalignment indication decision to a time when tester and or system is idle. Continuing with this instance in some of these examples the trigger point for a misalignment indication decision may be when the current lot is being switched even if the misalignment indication decision does not require testing data from later packaged devices in the current lot because there is typically more idle time during the switching of the lot than at other times such as socketing and unsocketing packaged devices. In examples where a misalignment indication decision is deferred any action resulting from a decision to indicate misalignment would also be deferred.

As mentioned above depending on the embodiment a trigger point may trigger access to one data collection and one pass of remaining stages of subprocess to in order to make a misalignment decision or multiple accesses to a plurality of test data collections and a plurality of passes in order to make a plurality of independent misalignment decisions consecutively or in parallel. For simplicity of explanation it is assumed in the description below that access to one data collection and one pass of the remaining stages of subprocess to is triggered at trigger point .

In the illustrated embodiments in stage test data collection is accessed for example by suspected misaligned contact identifier . Test data collection includes inter alia data generated and made accessible in one or more iterations of stages and which will be analyzed in one pass of stages to in order to make a decision on whether or not to indicate misalignment. See above description of for additional details on various embodiments of test data collection .

Depending on the embodiment in the current pass of method stages to may be performed stages to may be performed and or both stages to and stages to may be performed. In embodiments where both stages to and stages to are performed stages to may or may not be performed in parallel with stages to .

In the illustrated embodiments of stage pass fail data relating to misalignment in test data collection is examined for example by pass fail evaluator .

In the illustrated embodiments of stage it is determined for example by pass fail evaluator whether or not any pins failed tests relating to misalignment. Refer again to the example of test data which in the form of Unit 14 OPENS P P P F P P P . Pass fail evaluator may detect the F in the fourth position indicating that the fourth pin failed the test while the P s in the other positions indicate that the other pins passed the test.

If there are any failing pins yes to stage then stage is performed. If there are no failing pins then stage is skipped.

In some embodiments test data in test data collection which relate to pass fail tests may only include failure results. In these embodiments stages to may be simplified because there are no passing results to be examined.

In the illustrated embodiments in stage socket contact s corresponding to failing pin s are identified as suspected misaligned socket contact s for instance by pass fail evaluator . In some embodiments the determination of which socket contact s correspond to the failing pin s is facilitated by the usage of lookup table . In some embodiments data corresponding to identified suspected misaligned socket contacts is indexed to socket contact identity e.g. corresponding to a particular contact within socket to socket identity e.g. corresponding to a particular socket from the set of all sockets in use in a parallel test operation and or to socketing iteration identity e.g. corresponding to one particular socketing from a serialized within lot socketing sequence .

In the illustrated embodiments in stage it is determined for instance by pass fail evaluator whether or not all pass fail data required for attribute determination has been processed. In some embodiments all pass fail data related to misalignment in test data collection is processed in one or more iterations of stages to prior to determining attribute s . Depending on the embodiment the amount of pass fail data processed in each iteration may vary. If another iteration is required yes to stage then method iterates back to stage . If no more iterations are required then method proceeds with stage optionally after waiting for stages to to also be completed .

In the illustrated embodiments in stage a group of parametric data in test data collection relating to misalignment is analyzed for instance by parametric analyzer . Depending on the embodiment the group may include all the parametric data in test data collection relating to misalignment or may include only part of the parametric data. It is assumed that any feature or artifact that increases the standard deviation of measurements of a group of parametric test data being analyzed together could possibly lead to a false conclusion of defective subpopulations and or may mask the presence of actual defective subpopulations. Therefore in some embodiments each group includes parametric test data results preferably resulting from the same parametric test which are expected to be sufficiently similar to one another under identical physical socket contact to pin contact conditions.

For example assume test data collection relates to all pins or selected pins tested during one or more socketings. Further assume in this example that pins can be classified according to the characteristic electronic design and or physical characteristics so that each group of parametric data relates to performing a given test on pins with similar electrical and or physical characteristics. Continuing with the example assume as a simplified instance that test data collection includes CRES measurements for 16 pins with similar physical characteristics but of which eight are bidirectional input output pins four are dedicated input pins e.g. clock input output enable etc and two are power supply pins. Due to differences in the electronic circuits of the device design that are connected to the various types of pins the electrical characteristics under CRES measurement may differ producing different CRES measurement values even under identical socket contact to pin contact conditions. Therefore in this example the CRES test results relating to bidirectional input output pins dedicated input pins and power supply pins are analyzed in separate groups. In another example assume that the pins of the previous example also differ based on relevant physical characteristics such as pin location within the package. In this example CRES measurements can be divided into groups each of which is distinguished by electrical characteristic and or physical characteristic from the other groups. In some embodiments of these examples the division into groups may be facilitated by socket and or product specific information possibly including and optionally differentiated according to the package type which may be provided for example by look up table .

Depending on the embodiment of stage the analysis may or may not be statistical. Some embodiments of analysis procedures for stage are described elsewhere in this description for example with reference to and or further below.

In the illustrated embodiments of stage it is assumed that the analysis of stage enables determination if there is data incongruity in the group. If data incongruity exist yes to stage then method continues with stage . If on the other hand data incongruity does not exist no to stage then method skips stages and .

In the illustrated embodiments in stage it is determined which data is incongruous. For example it is determined which test result s are incongruous with other test results in the group.

In the illustrated embodiments in stage the socket contact s which correspond to pin s whose test results are incongruous are identified as suspected misaligned. In some embodiments the determination of which socket contact s correspond to the pin s with incongruous test results is facilitated by the usage of lookup table . It is noted that in some embodiments a particular pin may only have test result s which are either incongruous or congruous with group test results whereas in other embodiments this is not necessarily so and a particular pin may in some cases have test result s which are incongruous as well as test result s which are congruous. In some embodiments data corresponding to identified suspected misaligned socket contacts is indexed to socket contact identity e.g. corresponding to a particular contact within socket to socket identity e.g. corresponding to a particular socket from the set of all sockets in use in a parallel test operation and or to socketing iteration identity e.g. corresponding to one particular socketing from a serialized within lot socketing sequence .

In the illustrated embodiments in stage it is determined if all groups which should be processed prior to attribute determination have been processed. If all groups have been processed yes to stage then method proceeds to stage optionally after waiting for stages to to also be completed . If all groups have not been processed no to stage then method iterates to process the next group beginning with stage .

In some embodiments each group may include unique data points compared to any other groups whereas in other embodiments this may not necessarily be the case and any particular data point may be common to one or more groups.

In some embodiments there may be one or more group s common to the current test data collection and to test data collection s used in previous misalignment decision indication passes. In some of these embodiments the common group s may be again analyzed in stages to in order to identify suspected misaligned socket contacts in the group s if any. In other of these embodiments the common group s may not be re analyzed in stages to but the identities of any suspected misaligned socket contacts relating to the common group s which were previously identified may be retrieved.

It is noted that identifying a socket contact as being suspected misaligned in stage or does not necessarily mean that the socket contact is misaligned. For example as noted above other circumstances may lead to a socket contact being suspected for misalignment for example a dirty socket contact damaged socket contact a contact blocked by a particle. For this reason the term suspected is used.

In some embodiments the identification of suspected misaligned socket contact s is advantageous. Some examples of advantages will now be provided for further illustration to the reader but embodiments of the invention do not limit the possible advantages. For example in some embodiments the identification of suspected misaligned socket contact s in stage or enables tracking to see if the same socket contact s are consistently being identified as suspected misaligned for each iteration of stage or or there is instead inconsistency in which socket contact s are identified as suspected misaligned. Continuing with the example in some cases the consistency or inconsistency for example as recorded by an incidence attribute see below across packaged devices may be useful in making the decision of whether or not to indicate misalignment. As another example in some embodiments additionally or alternatively the identification of suspected misaligned socket contact s in stage or may cause future analysis to focus only on data relating to corresponding pin s or cause future analysis to focus more on such data than on data relating to other pins. Continuing with the example in some cases only data relating to pin s whose corresponding socket contact s were previously identified as suspected misaligned based on data from previous socketing s is analyzed to see if there is an upward trend in parametric measurements such as CRES and or for other tracking purposes. As another example in some embodiments additionally or alternatively data relating to socket contact s identified as suspected misaligned in stage or is excluded from any calculations reserved for normal parametric measurements such as normal CRES measurements. Continuing with the example in some cases if it is desired to calculate the mean and standard deviation to model a nominal dataset for example for the unimodal model described above with reference to stage of data relating to identified suspected misaligned socket contact s may be excluded. As another example in some embodiments additionally or alternatively the identification of suspected misaligned socket contacts in stage or enables the determination of common attributes between identified socket contacts. Continuing with the example in some cases it can be determined if all identified suspected misaligned socket contacts are associated with pins that are located at particular positions in a packaged device or which have common electrical functionality. As another example additionally or alternatively the identity of the suspected misaligned socket contact s and optionally other analysis results as identified in stage or can be reported to engineering personnel and or an operator for use in determining the root cause of the problem. Continuing with the example in some cases identified suspected misaligned socket contact s may be subsequently optically inspected in order to narrow down the list of hypothetical root cause problems.

It should be apparent from the above advantages that in some cases it may be advantageous to identify suspected misaligned socket contact s even outside the context of a misalignment indication decision or in a different misalignment indication system than described with respect to method . Similarly suspected misaligned socket contact identifier may in these cases be useful even separate from a misalignment indication system or within a different misalignment indication system than system .

In the illustrated embodiments in stage one or more attributes of a set of one or more identified suspected misaligned socket contact s is determined for example by attribute determiner .

Depending on the embodiment the determination of attribute s of identified suspected misaligned socket contact s can be performed on one or more sets of identified suspected misaligned socket contact s . Embodiments of the invention do not limit the division into sets but for the sake of further illustration to the reader some examples are now given. For example in some embodiments all identified suspected misaligned socket contact s may belong to the same set and attributes s for the set may be determined. In another example in some embodiments additionally or alternatively suspected misaligned socket contact s identified via pass fail test data may be part of one set analyzed for attribute s and suspected misaligned socket contact s identified via parametric test data may be part of a different set which is separately analyzed for attribute s . In another example suspected misaligned socket contact s corresponding to incongruous data with larger value s than congruous data may be part of one set analyzed for attribute s and suspected misaligned socket contact s corresponding to incongruous data with smaller value s than congruous data may be part of a different set analyzed for attribute s . In embodiments with more than one set each set may include unique identified suspected misaligned socket contact s or each set may not necessarily include unique identified suspected misaligned socket contact s and partial or full overlap among identified suspected misaligned socket contact s which are members of each set is possible.

The invention does not limit the possible attribute s which may be determined in stage . However for the sake of further illustration to the reader some examples will now be presented. Examples of possible attribute categories include any of the following inter alia actual test results statistical attribute s temporal attribute s e.g. history electrical and or physical characteristics attributes position geographical attribute s etc. Examples of possible attribute s which may or may not fit the listed attribute categories include any of the following inter alia incidence e.g. number of times that a particular socket contact is identified as suspected misaligned the badness explained below of a particular suspected misaligned socket contact incongruous parametric data corresponding to the set the total number of and or fraction of identified suspected misaligned socket contacts s within the socket the likelihood ratio e.g. as described in tested packaged device during which a particular socket contact was identified each time as suspected misaligned electrical functionality of pin corresponding to a particular identified suspected misaligned socket contact unusual physical characteristic of pin corresponding to particular identified suspected misaligned socket contact and or unusual physical characteristic of particular identified suspected misaligned socket contact physical positions of identified suspected misaligned socket contacts within the socket statistical values derived from incongruous testing data corresponding to the set parametric congruous testing data for example in order to provide a contrast statistical values derived from congruous testing data statistical values derived from testing data of all socket contacts both those identified as suspected misaligned and those not so identified change in any of the above as a function of socketing iterations number of socketing s since the last socket maintenance operation socketing index and or trend etc. In various embodiments separate statistical values may be derived from testing data which was analyzed in different groups or statistical values may be derived from testing data which was analyzed in all groups of the current pass. In various embodiments statistical values can include any appropriate statistical value such as for example mean i.e. average median maximum minimum standard deviation and or rolling average etc. Depending on the embodiment and the attribute determination of attributes derived for different sets of identified suspected misaligned socket contact s may or may not be cumulative for test data collection . For example in some embodiments an incidence attribute for a particular suspected misaligned socket contact which is included in more than one set cumulates over all sets in which the socket contact is included. In other embodiments of the same example accumulation is not required since suspected misaligned socket contacts would be evaluated as one set for incidence attribute even though not necessarily for other attributes or because separate incidence counters for each set is preferable for making the misalignment indication decision. Assuming embodiments where if a particular pin fails a pass fail test sensitive to misalignment and parametric measurements for a test sensitive to misalignment is in any event performed on that pin in some of these embodiments if a socket contact is identified as suspected misaligned based on data from a pass fail test and also identified as suspected misaligned based on data from a parametric test where the data from both tests relates to the same packaged device the incidence attribute is incremented once whereas in other of these embodiments the incidence attribute is incremented twice.

In some embodiments with a badness attribute the badness of an individual suspected misaligned socket contact may be expressed in any appropriate manner for example by the incidence of a socket contact being identified as suspected misaligned by the mean median or maximum values that have been observed for the corresponding pins etc. In some embodiments the badness attribute may additionally or alternatively be expressed as a function of the congruous testing data points or of the statistical parameters of a distribution of the congruous data points. For example in some of these embodiments the number of standard deviations from the average of the distribution of the congruous data points that were analyzed in the same group s as the incongruous data associated with an identified suspected misaligned socket contact or the average or maximum value of the incongruous data associated with an identified suspected misaligned socket contact may be computed and used as a parametric figure of merit of the badness .

In some embodiments an unusual physical characteristic for a pin may relate to an unusual layout feature such as a pin which is located at the corners of a packaged device. Similarly in some embodiments an unusual physical characteristic for a socket contact may relate to an unusual design feature such as a socket contact which is located at the corners of a socket.

In the illustrated embodiments of stage it is determined if another set of identified suspected misaligned socket contact s needs to be processed for attribute determination prior to making a misalignment indication decision. If yes yes to stage then attribute s are determined for another set in another iteration of stage . If no other sets need to be processed then method continues with stage .

In the illustrated embodiments in stage it is decided for example by miscontact evaluator whether or not a misalignment indication condition has been met and misalignment is to be indicated. For instance miscontact evaluator may evaluate attribute s determined in stage and decide if misalignment indication condition has been met by the attribute s singly and or in combination. Depending on the embodiment condition for a misalignment indication may necessitate a particular attribute or combination of attributes or condition may be fulfilled by any one of two or more stipulations where each stipulation requires a particular attribute or combination of attributes. For example a misalignment indication related to a socketing condition in which a packaged device is seated in a socket with a small rotational misalignment may be defined by one or more of the socket s contacts positioned at the socket corners being identified as suspect misaligned at least 3 times in the last 30 device socketings while simultaneously no socket contacts are identified as suspect misaligned from among a specified set of contacts positioned near the center of the socket also based on the last 30 device socketings. Thus in this example a determination of rotational misalignment involves a combination of two stipulations each utilizing a socket contact positional attribute and an attribute related to the frequency of socket contacts being identified as suspect misaligned .

Depending on the embodiment misalignment indication condition and all possible stipulations may be predetermined or there may be a possibility for creating and or adapting misalignment indication condition and or one or more stipulations. As an example of the latter embodiment in some cases if a previous misalignment decision was to not indicate misalignment due to the absence of one stipulated attribute even though remaining stipulated attribute s were present then a current misalignment decision may be to indicate misalignment if the stipulated attribute that was previously absent is present even if one of the previously present stipulated attribute s is now absent.

Embodiments of the invention do not limit the attribute s which are required to meet the misalignment indication condition but for the sake of further illustration to the reader some examples are now given. For example in some embodiments an attribute required singly or in combination may be that a median or average value for all CRES measurements whose incongruity led to corresponding socket contacts to be identified as suspected misaligned is above a predetermined threshold or that a median or average value for all CRES measurements whose incongruity led to corresponding socket contacts to be identified as suspected misaligned is above a value threshold relative to the median or average value for all congruous data. As another example in some embodiments an attribute required singly or in combination may be that incidence of a socket contact being identified as suspected misaligned is above a predetermined threshold or that incidence of a socket contact being identified as suspected misaligned which was previously never flagged as suspected misaligned is above a predetermined threshold. As another example in some embodiments an attribute required singly or in combination may be incidence of a socket contact being identified as suspected misaligned in at least x out of the last y socketings.

In the illustrated embodiments if it is determined that the misalignment indication condition has not been met and therefore misalignment is not to be indicated no to stage then method iterates back to stage waiting for the next trigger if any to make one or more new misalignment indication decision s . If instead it is determined that the misalignment indication condition has been met and misalignment is to be indicated yes to stage then misalignment is indicated in stage . For example miscontact evaluator may provide misalignment indication to distribution controller which in turn distributes misalignment indication s e.g. indication and or B outside of misalignment decision system . As another example additionally or alternatively miscontact evaluator may output misalignment indication s directly from misalignment decision system .

Embodiments of the invention do not limit the type of misalignment indication but for further illustration to the reader some examples will now be presented. For example a misalignment indication may include an automatic abort indication to tester and or handler e.g. indication and or B and or a notification indication to an operator and or engineering personnel e.g. indication which may include a hardware indication such as a red light and or may include an indication sent in any appropriate fashion including via email beeper and or as part of a report etc . In some cases the notification may be recognizable to the operator as indicating that action is required for example manual abort review to see if aborting is necessary etc. In some cases the notification may additionally or alternatively be informative for example providing diagnostic output from execution of method . In some of these cases the diagnostic output can include the identity of the suspected misaligned socket contacts and or any other appropriate data.

Embodiments of the invention do not limit consequences of an automatic or manual abort but for the sake of further illustration to the reader some examples are now given. Consequences may include for example not performing part or all of method . Continuing with the example in some cases at least performance of stage may be stopped. Consequences may additionally or alternatively include for example further diagnostic troubleshooting such as optical inspection of the pins of a packaged device which has been tested and or inspection of the socket in question for instance either manually or using a specialized automated inspection tool. In some cases of troubleshooting system may be interfaced to diagnostic equipment in order to facilitate troubleshooting. Consequences may additionally or alternatively include one or more alignment procedures.

In some embodiments an indication which is not a misalignment indication may be provided even if the decision is to not provide a misalignment indication. For example diagnostic output may be provided despite the decision to not indicate misalignment. As another example additionally or alternatively an indication may be provided because the decision that misalignment condition was not met led to the determination that some other condition was met. Continuing with the example in some cases a clean or damaged socket contact indication may be output if the analysis led to that conclusion see for example discussion of further below . In some embodiments an indication unrelated to misalignment may be provided in addition to the misalignment indication.

In the illustrated embodiments after misalignment has been indicated in stage it is determined in stage whether or not to wait for any additional triggers. If it is decided to wait for any additional triggers yes to stage then method iterates back to stage waiting for the next trigger if any . If instead it is decided not to wait for any additional triggers no to stage then method ends. For example in some embodiments if the misalignment indication includes an automatic abort and or notification to manually abort then the decision is to not wait for any additional triggers. In these embodiments if the misalignment indication does not include an automatic abort nor a notification to manually abort then the decision is to wait for the next trigger if any . Alternatively in some embodiments even if the misalignment indication does not include an automatic abort nor a notification to manually abort the decision in some cases may be to not wait for any additional triggers. For example in some of these embodiments the decision may be to not wait for any additional triggers if the current misalignment indication was sufficiently informative to allow the operator to review and determine if manual abort is necessary.

Some embodiments of the current invention may be advantageous for any of the following reasons first identification of suspected misaligned socket contacts may be advantageous compared to a method where there is no identification. See above description of some possible advantages of identification before description of stage . Second additionally or alternatively in embodiments with parametric data the decision of whether or not to indicate misalignment may in some cases be more fine tuned due to the analysis of parametric data that can take on any of multiple values compared to a method which only included analysis of binary pass fail test results. This fine tuning for example can in some of these cases lead to a misalignment indication being output at an advantageous time. Continuing with the example if a decision to indicate misalignment instead relied only on say the opens test then indicating misalignment after say only one failure may in some instances be not as advantageous because the failure may be due to packaged device fabrication error rather than misalignment but indicating misalignment only after say 5 failures may in some cases be not as advantageous because the misalignment by then may be severe. Third additionally or alternatively in some cases tester and handler do not need to be adapted in order to implement method .

Although embodiments of the invention do not limit applications of the above described methods and systems some examples relating to packaged device testing will now be provided for further illustration to the reader.

The examples of previously discussed in the context of Cres data gathered in a wafer sort operation apply equally to a package test operation. In such an embodiment the graph of may be interpreted as showing CRES measurements by touchdown or socketing sequence for three pins Pin Pin and Pin during testing of a series of packaged devices through a given socket.

Statistical method described with reference to may be applied in some embodiments to the Pin CRES data of when those data have been derived from a package test operation. In these embodiments in which the data of and are derived from a package test operation the calculation of the Likelihood Ratio from the cumulative Pin data at the 70th 90th and 110th socketing shown in and respectively proceeds exactly as in the wafer sort embodiments described above and the meaning and interpretation of the resulting Likelihood Ratio values is also the same. continues to be a useful illustration in some package test embodiments of the fitting of two Gaussian curves to the example of a bimodal Pin data distribution found in a sequence of 110 package test socketings specifically highlighting the meaning and calculation of the mixing fraction values for the two fitted curves as described previously.

For embodiments in which stage of triggers after each package test socketing the Likelihood Ratio may be calculated based on cumulative data from the present and a prior set of test operations performed using the socket being analyzed. In for example according to some embodiments of the present invention the cumulative data from the first 70 socketings for each of Pin Pin and Pin data up to dashed line of are analyzed as a group using method of possibly an analysis of cumulative data for other pins each group having data from a single pin is also performed . In such package test embodiments the calculations and interpretation of the Likelihood Ratio are as previously described and for the given example may provide an indication of what may be an appropriate threshold in making a decision to indicate misalignment. With such nominal data the maximum Likelihood Ratio calculated has a value around 3 suggesting sufficient margin if a threshold were set to be for instance near the value of around 3.5 i.e. set for instance to the Likelihood Ratio which was calculated using the data of .

In some embodiments other procedures can be implemented in performing stages to additionally or alternatively to method described above with reference to .

An example of another procedure that may be applied to embodiments concerning package test socketings is now given not in order to limit applications of other procedures but to further illustrate embodiments of the invention to the reader. Referring to the data of for pins and some embodiments of histograms for the combined dataset of Pin Pin and Pin with reference to package testing are shown for the first 70 socketings socketings to and socketings to in and respectively. For example it may be assumed that the three pins are similar enough that data relating to the three pins may be analyzed together.

In the illustrated embodiments of this example it is assumed that the distribution is normal and similar for all material and therefore suitable historical data representative of normal CRES distributions may be used as a reference. In this example assuming the CRES distribution of is normal a model normal distribution with mean of 2.13 ohms and standard deviation of 0.72 ohms may be used as a basis for identification of subsequent points with statistically unlikely high CRES values for example those with values greater than the mean plus three standard deviations or 4.3 ohms for the example data group of . In excursions the CRES data distribution will be composed of one or more subdivisions as shown in and continuing in . Based on the calculated threshold of the present example the data associated with the high CRES values on the right hand side of the histogram are easily distinguished based on CRES values greater than 4.3 ohms.

Referring to beginning at the dashed vertical line marking touchdown number Pin begins to exhibit elevated CRES values with most Pin values beyond that touchdown falling above 4.3 ohms.

As previously discussed in wafer sort embodiments similarly in some package test socketing embodiments a clean rather than a misalignment problem may be distinguished by a unimodal distribution with a higher mean CRES than in earlier touchdowns. Refer to which shows some embodiments of histograms for the combined dataset of Pin Pin and Pin when cleaning is due to remove material buildup on socket contacts. It is evident that compared to the normal CRES distribution of the mean CRES in is higher but the distribution remains unimodal hinting that the entire contact population has shifted.

In another example of a procedure which can additionally or alternatively be implemented in performing stages to a parametric statistical analysis of CRES data may be used to distinguish sub populations of pins with unusually low or high mean values or unusually narrow or wide standard deviations. These subpopulations can potentially correlate with individual contacts or groups of contacts with misalignment problems.

In still another example of a procedure which can additionally or alternatively be implemented a rolling average of CRES measurements may be maintained for example for each pin over a certain number of socketings. Continuing with the example stage may be triggered after each socketing with the rolling average analysis performed in stage on data from the last predetermined number of socketings. Refer to which in the context of package testing illustrates some embodiments of rolling average CRES measurements for the most recent 16 socketings for Pin Pin and Pin by socketing using the data from . The dashed vertical line corresponds to socketing . It can be seen that the rolling average of Pin diverges from the rolling averages of the other two pins going above 3 ohms whereas the rolling averages of the other two pins stay pretty constant. Refer also to which illustrates some embodiments of calculated CRES standard deviation based on a rolling 20 point 20 socketing window for the data from on Pin . It can be seen that there is a dramatic increase in standard deviation around socketing and again around socketing . These increases occur approximately at the socketings where the data in the rolling 20 point window includes both the older better CRES and the newer worse CRES data points.

In still another example of a procedure which can additionally or alternatively be implemented a body of reference data may be accrued over time. For instance CRES data relating to one or more individual socket contacts from a rolling window of a certain number of consecutive socketings may be acquired with the cumulative data set treated as the reference distribution.

Continuing with the examples based on the data of after using method and or any other procedure for performing stages to and then performing stages and and or after performing stages to attribute determination can be performed in stage . In some embodiments attribute determination includes determination of incidence of a socket contact being identified as suspected misaligned. Illustrating such an embodiment again with the data of and applying a CRES threshold of e.g. 4.3 ohms it can be seen that the incidence counter for Pin would be incremented only once due to a single measurement of about 5.0 ohms at socketing incidence 1 1 while the incidence counter for Pin would be incremented in almost every socketing subsequent to socketing . Therefore in these embodiments attribute determination would include one incidence of Pin being identified as suspected misaligned and multiple incidences of Pin being identified as suspected misaligned. In some embodiments additionally or alternatively attribute determination includes trend analysis. For instance referring again to the upward trend for Pin compared to Pins and is evident. Any other attribute determination including inter alia position attribute determination may additionally or alternatively be performed in any of the above examples which were based on the data of .

Continuing with the examples based on the data of as applied to package testing any type of misalignment indication condition may be evaluated in stage . Although the type of condition is not limited for further illustration to the reader some instances are now provided. For instance in some embodiments a decision to indicate misalignment may be made when the Likelihood Ratio is at or above 3.5 or when the Likelihood Ratio is above 3.5 and other condition s have been met. In another instance additionally or alternatively a condition may require that the average CRES value of identified suspected misaligned socket contacts exceeds a predetermined value or a value threshold relative to the average CRES value of socket contacts which have not been identified as suspected misaligned. Continuing with this instance in some cases of the data of a decision to indicate misalignment may be made if the average CRES value of identified suspected misaligned socket contacts exceeds e.g. 3 ohms or exceeds e.g. the mean plus four standard deviations of the distribution of CRES values from socket contacts not identified as suspected misaligned. In another instance additionally or alternatively in some cases of the data of because the distribution is unimodal there may be a decision not to indicate misalignment.

It will also be understood that in some embodiments a system or part of a system according to the invention may be a suitably programmed machine. Likewise some embodiments of the invention contemplate a computer program being readable by a machine for executing a method of the invention. Some embodiments of the invention further contemplate a machine readable memory tangibly embodying program code readable by the machine for executing a method of the invention.

While the invention has been shown and described with respect to particular embodiments it is not thus limited. Numerous modifications changes and improvements within the scope of the invention will now occur to the reader.
