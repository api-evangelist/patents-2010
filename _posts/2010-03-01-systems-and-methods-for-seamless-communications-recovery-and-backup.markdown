title: Systems and methods for seamless communications recovery and backup
abstract: A recovery network may provide communication recovery and backup services to an organization. The recovery network may be communicatively coupled to the existing communication infrastructure of an organization via one or more alternative communication paths. The alternative communication paths may couple the recovery network to the organization independently of a public communication network. Upon activation of recovery services, the recovery network may receive communication requests directed to the organization from the public communication network. The recovery network may service one or more of the requests using one or more of the alternative communication paths. Similarly, the recovery network may service outbound communication requests originating at the organization over an alternative communication path. Communication requests may be backed up (e.g., within a voicemail or other backup system) until an alternative path or communication network becomes available and/or may be redirected to other addresses within the public communication network.

This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 156 349 filed Feb. 27 2009 and entitled Systems and Methods for Seamless Communications Recovery and Backup which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

This disclosure relates to communication systems and in particular to systems and methods for providing seamless communications recovery and backup services.

Communication systems are critical for many organizations. However it may be difficult to regain control of incoming and outgoing communications during emergency or other conditions such as equipment failure cabling failure power system anomalies disaster conditions e.g. fire earthquake etc. and the like.

The communication system of the organization includes a private branch exchange PBX to couple the communications devices of the organization to the PCN via a communications line . In addition various computing devices may be coupled to a network via the PBX and or PCN . Although organization is shown as connected to the PCN via a PBX any connection method and or connection device could be used under the teachings of this disclosure such as an internet router integrated access device or the like.

The communications line may include a fiber optic line e.g. a T1 line and or any other data communications medium known in the art e.g. copper cabling wireless transmission or the like . The communications devices of the organization may include but are not limited to telephones fax machines computing devices e.g. personal computers automated calling systems voicemail systems voice conferencing systems group messaging systems radio systems and the like.

The connection between the organization and the PCN may allow the organization to communicate with other entities . The entities may communicate with the organization using various communications devices and according to various communications protocols including but not limited to fax cellular telephone land line telephone satellite phone computing device e.g. over the Internet and the like.

Communications between the entities and the organization can be disrupted by a fault condition occurring within the PCN and or between the PCN and the organization e.g. on the communication line and or within the organization itself e.g. the PBX . As used herein a fault condition may refer to any condition wherein services provided to the organization by the PCN are disrupted or degraded.

For example portions of the PCN may experience equipment failure power loss congestion or the like. These faults may disrupt the connection between the PCN and the organization e.g. PBX . Alternatively or in addition a fault not directly related to the PCN s connection to the organization may cause loss of services for the organization . For example due to faults in other portions of the PCN the PCN may allocate resources normally used to service the organization to servicing other customers not shown which may degrade the services available to the organization . Similarly faults may occur on the communications line connecting the organization to the PCN such as a line cut or other physical damage.

A fault condition may additionally encompass any condition within the organization that would preclude normal operation of the communication system e.g. a robbery within a banking organization a fire chemical spill hardware and or software failure of the PBX power failure or the like . Therefore although selected fault types and fault scenarios are discussed herein one skilled in the art would recognize that there are virtually unlimited different ways in which the services between the PCN and the organization could be disrupted. Each of these possible fault types and or scenarios falls within the scope of this disclosure. Therefore this disclosure should not be read as limited to any particular fault type or fault scenario.

A recovery network may provide communication recovery services to the organization . The recovery services may be activated during a fault condition or other disruption of service between the organization and the PCN . As used herein recovery services may include a full replacement of the communications services provided by the PCN replacement of a different or alternative set of communications services and or supplemental replacement of the services provided by the PCN e.g. the recovery network may provide communications services in parallel with the PCN . The nature of the recovery services provided to the organization may be defined by configuration information maintained by the organization . As will be discussed below the configuration information may include one or more recovery rules to specify how particular communications are to be processed by the recovery network .

The recovery network may provide an alternative communication path by which communication between the entities and the organization may be maintained during a disruption of service in the PCN or elsewhere. For example in some embodiments the PCN may be configured either manually or automatically as described below to divert incoming communication requests directed to the organization e.g. incoming calls faxes email messages etc. to the recovery network . The recovery network may service the communication requests using an alternative communication path such as a satellite network as shown in .

As will be discussed below when active the recovery network may selectively service communication requests directed to the organization using one or more alternative communications paths by routing the requests to alternative addresses e.g. phone numbers within the PCN by providing equivalent services e.g. providing a phone tree directory etc. and or by backing up the communication requests. The determination of which requests should be handled in which manner as opposed to handling the requests using other recovery mechanisms may be specified in configuration information maintained within the recovery network . For instance the configuration information for the organization may include a recovery rule to specify that requests directed to a particular number within the organization e.g. premier customer hotline be routed directly to the organization via the satellite network . Other recovery rules may specify how the recovery network is to process other communication requests. For instance a recovery rule may specify that calls to a general customer information telephone number be routed to an automated phone tree or to another destination in the PCN such as a cellular telephone or landline e.g. to save bandwidth on the satellite network for more important communications .

As shown in the alternative communication path satellite network may provide a communication link between the recovery network and organization that is independent of the PCN . Therefore the recovery network may be capable of providing communications services for the organization regardless of e.g. independently of the organization s connectivity to the PCN .

Although the alternative communication path is shown in as a satellite network any alternative communication path known in the art could be used. Examples of alternative communication paths include but are not limited to one or more wireless networks e.g. a wireless point to point network one or more radio frequency RF networks a dedicated wired network an IP network a cellular network a combination of networks or the like. Therefore this disclosure should not be read as limited to any particular type of alternative communication path.

The organization may be communicatively coupled to the satellite network by connecting equipment appropriate for accessing satellite services to the same communication system the organization uses to connect to the PCN . In the example the organization is coupled to the satellite network via a satellite interface . The satellite interface and or satellite network may be capable of supporting the equivalent of one of more T1 connections e.g. such as the connection to the PCN which can be used for both voice and data communications. The communications bandwidth available through the satellite network and or interface may be further expanded by compressing the data transmitted thereon discussed below .

The satellite interface includes appropriate power and other equipment e.g. satellite dish and modem for reception and transmission of data over the satellite network . In some embodiments the satellite interface may further include a backup power source not shown to power the satellite interface and or the other communications components of the organization e.g. components and in the event of a power outage or other power supply anomalies such as power spikes brown outs or the like.

The satellite interface may include a gateway to integrate the communication system with the satellite network . As will be discussed in additional detail below the gateway may be configured to process incoming and outgoing communications on the satellite network . The inbound data processing may include but is not limited to decompressing decrypting authenticating formatting and de multiplexing data received on the satellite network . The outbound processing may include but is not limited to compressing encrypting authenticating formatting and multiplexing data for transmission on the satellite network .

The gateway receives data over the satellite network e.g. via the satellite interface . The data may be encrypted e.g. scrambled using a particular encryption algorithm. The gateway may be configured to decrypt the data using a shared key a negotiated key a secret key or other data security mechanism e.g. Public Key Infrastructure PKI or the like .

The data transmitted on the satellite network may be compressed using a particular compression algorithm or technique e.g. the data may be compressed at a 16 1 compression ratio . The gateway may decompress the incoming data to allow the data to be used by the communication system e.g. used by the PBX and or computing devices .

The gateway may be further configured to de multiplex the incoming data to determine the routing of the data within the communication system . The data transmitted over the satellite network may include a plurality of multiplexed data streams e.g. voice call streams fax streams IP data streams and so on . The gateway may be configured to identify and de multiplex the various data streams within the incoming data e.g. identify and de multiplex voice data fax data IP network data and so on . The gateway may then process e.g. format and or route the de multiplexed data to the appropriate receiver within the communication system e.g. route voice fax data to the PBX route IP network data to the computing devices and so on .

The gateway may be further configured to format data received via the satellite network . For instance voice fax data may be converted from a format used to transmit the data on the satellite network into a format that can be processed by the PBX . For example the PBX may be configured to receive voice communications data in Integrated Services Digital Network ISDN format over its primary connection to the PCN . However communication request data may be transmitted from the recovery network in a different format e.g. the recovery network may packetize the data for transmission over the satellite network an IP network or other network . The gateway may convert the voice fax data from the transmission format e.g. IP packets into the format used by the PBX e.g. ISDN Primary Rate Interface ISDN PRI format . The nature of the conversion at the gateway may be adapted according to the configuration and capabilities of the communication system e.g. PBX . The gateway may be configured to convert data accordingly e.g. into the format used by the PBX . Therefore this disclosure should not be read as limited to any particular data formats and or to any particular conversions therebetween. For example the gateway may provide ISDN Interface services Signaling System 7 SS7 T1 Session Initiation Protocol SIP analog communication services or the like using an alternative communication path e.g. the satellite network .

The gateway may be simultaneously coupled to an IP network of the organization e.g. comprising one or more computing devices to provide IP networking services thereto. As such the gateway may be configured to de multiplex and or format inbound IP data received via the satellite network from a format used on the satellite network into a format that is usable by the computing devices e.g. formatted into IP packets etc. . The IP network data processing may include de multiplexing decompressing decrypting and or authenticating the data as described above.

The gateway may process outbound voice and data for transmission on the satellite network . As discussed above the outbound data processing may include formatting multiplexing compressing encrypting and or authenticating e.g. digitally signing the data for transmission on the satellite network . The gateway may multiplex various types of data generated within the communication system into one or more data streams e.g. voice data fax data IP data and so on . The gateway may compress the outbound data according to a compression algorithm technique for transmission over the satellite network e.g. compressed at 16 1 ratio . In addition the gateway may format the data into format used by and or compatible with the satellite network e.g. packetize the data . The formatting may further include encrypting and or authenticating e.g. digitally signing the data as described above. The nature of the multiplexing compression encryption and or authentication may be adapted according to the configuration and or capabilities of the satellite network the satellite interface and or the communication system .

In this way the gateway may couple the communication system to the satellite network to allow communications data to be received and or transmitted thereby. Accordingly a switch over from communications services provided by the PCN to communications services provided via the satellite network may be seamless e.g. may not cause disruption within the organization and or may allow for continued use of the organization s communication system including the organization s existing communication system and or computing devices .

In other embodiments the gateway may not be required. For example the PBX may be a VoIP PBX capable of processing data in the format used on the satellite network . In this case the PBX may be communicatively coupled directly to the satellite interface . In other embodiments the communication system may include a hardware software VoIP client not shown . The hardware software VoIP client may be capable of processing data in the format used on the satellite network and may therefore be coupled directly to the satellite interface .

The satellite interface and or gateway may be interchangeable. For example the organization may have several interfaces and or gateways deployed at different locations e.g. in different buildings regions and the like . Therefore if one or more of the interfaces gateways is damaged the recovery network may be configured to use another interface gateway . Similarly the satellite interface and gateway devices may be mobile. This may allow the organization to move from one location to another with minimal disruption to its communications services or to provide service to additional locations. In some embodiments the gateway and or satellite interface may be mounted on or inside a vehicle e.g. truck or trailer and parked outside another location to deliver service where needed. Additionally the gateway device may be capable of dynamically restoring communication with the recovery network using another network connection e.g. in the event the satellite network becomes unavailable goes down is overloaded etc. . The gateway may be decoupled from the satellite interface and plugged into another high speed network connection e.g. a high speed Internet connection wireless IP cellular etc. at any location worldwide. The gateway may provide the same compression decompression encryption decryption format conversions and other processes at the new location using the new network connection. For example the gateway device may be decoupled from the satellite interface and connected directly into the organization s still functional high speed Internet connection. The recovery network may immediately communicate with and identify the gateway at the new location e.g. IP address and resume incoming and outgoing communications with the organization utilizing the new pathway. In some embodiments the gateway device may utilize the high speed internet connection by default and may only switch over to the satellite interface when necessary e.g. upon detecting a failure and or degradation of service in the Internet connection .

In some embodiments the recovery network may be configured to attempt to reroute some or all communication requests intended for the organization to one or more other addresses within the PCN as opposed to routing the communication request to the organization via the alternative communication path . The recovery network may include configuration information for the organization discussed below whereby the organization may designate processing to be performed on particular communication requests. For example the recovery rules discussed below may specify different processing for different types of communication requests e.g. call requests directed to one or more telephone numbers one or more fax numbers to particular IP addresses to particular email addresses and the like . One or more of these recovery rules may specify that requests made to a particular address within the organization be rerouted to an alternative address within the PCN . For example during a failure condition of the PCN the recovery network may route calls made to a line dedicated to a sister location of the organization that is not affected by the fault condition. In this way the organization may free up bandwidth on the alternative communication path satellite network for communication requests deemed to be more important.

Alternatively calls deemed to be particularly important may be routed to a rapid response line such as a cellular telephone or satellite phone. For instance the organization may be cut off from normal interaction with the PCN due an interruption of service e.g. equipment failure cable cut power anomaly fire robbery etc. . During the emergency condition the recovery network may be configured to route certain communication requests to the rapid response line to allow the organization to continue servicing customers and or provide information to concerned parties e.g. family members of the employees of the organization .

The recovery network may provide additional interfaces by which external entities e.g. callers may communicate with the organization . For example the communication system of the organization may include a phone tree dial by name directory dial by extension directory automated attendants automatic call distribution ACD music while on hold voicemail and the like. When the organization is cut off from the PCN however these services may become unavailable. The recovery network may be configured to provide these services such that when the recovery network is active entities may communicate with the organization through the recovery network much as they would with the organization through the PCN providing an important business as usual layer of transparency for callers. For example the recovery network may include a dual tone multi frequency DTMF interface a text to speech service or other services by which the organization s services may be made available to the entities e.g. the organization s dial by directory service one or more automated attendants and other services . The organization may provide configuration information e.g. recovery rules phone tree information directory information and the like which may configure the recovery network to emulate the operation of the organization s communication system e.g. provide the same dial by name directory extension directory music on hold and so on . The organization may provide the recovery network with voice recordings and other assets to allow the recovery network to closely emulate the organization e.g. provide callers with the organization s employee directory prompts music branding message and the like .

In another embodiment the recovery network may re route communications to an alternative communications network e.g. to a network other than those in the PCN . Rerouting the communications to an alternative network may comprise converting communications data to from one or more alternative formats. In one example the recovery network may communicatively couple the organization to an emergency services network which may comprise one or more radio frequency RF networks e.g. dedicated RF channels frequencies and so on . The recovery network may receive voice communications originating at the organization via an alternative communication path such as the satellite network and may forward the communication on the emergency services network . The forwarding may comprise forwarding the communication which may have originally been voice telephone data VoIP data or the like as an RF transmission. Data originating in the emergency services network and directed to the organization may be converted into an appropriate format and forwarded to the organization via the satellite network . In this way the organization may communicate with an alternative communications network e.g. an emergency services network using its existing communications infrastructure .

As will be discussed below the operation of the recovery network may be controlled via a configuration interface not shown . Personnel of the organization may access the configuration interface to update the configuration information of the organization in real time e.g. activate deactivate the recovery network change communication routing settings change alternative communication path settings change caller selectable options record greetings and prompts etc. .

Although depicts only a single computing device the recovery network may be implemented using plurality of computing devices in a clustered configuration not shown . The clustered configuration may allow the recovery network to provide concurrent recovery services for a plurality of different organizations not shown . For example the clustered configuration may allow the recovery network to scale as required by the conditions at the organizations. Moreover the clustered configuration may be spread over various different geographical regions such that if one or more of the geographical regions of the recovery network experiences a failure e.g. power loss communications failures etc. other portions of the recovery network may continue to provide recovery services. Therefore the clustered configuration of the recovery network may include redundancy such that the recovery network may continue to provide services regardless of the loss of portions of the cluster. The cluster may further provide for fail over and or load balancing between cluster members.

Various components discussed below of the recovery network such as the data store the alternative path interface the PCN interface the alternative network interface and or the backup module may comprise redundant components. For example the PCN interface may be configured to interface with the PCN using a plurality of different connection media using various different communication protocols and so on e.g. via multiple T1 lines fiber lines wireless links network connections multiple service providers and so on . Therefore if one or more of the interfaces is down other interfaces may be used to maintain communication with the PCN . The alternative path interface may include similar redundant connections to each of the one or more alternative communication paths satellite communication path wireless radio communications path and or fiber optic communication path .

Although not shown in the recovery network may include and or be communicatively coupled to other types of alternative communication paths. For example the alternative communication paths may include but are not limited to an IP network such as the Internet a point to point wireless network such as the radio network a virtual private network VPN a MultiProtocol Label Switching network MPLS a mesh network a WiMax network e.g. IEEE 802.16 network or the like. Therefore this disclosure should not be read as limited to any particular set of alternative communication paths .

In some embodiments the functional modules e.g. modules and may be implemented in whole or in part as respective distinct software modules embodied on a computer readable storage medium and operable on one or more of the clustered computing devices of the recovery network . Moreover one or more of the modules may be tied to particular hardware components of the one or more computing devices. For example the data store may be tied to one or more data storage medium devices not shown capable of storing the data structures used by the data store . Similarly the alternative path interface the PCN interface and or the alternative networks interface may be tied to one or more communications interfaces used to interact with the alternative communication paths alternative networks and or the PCN respectively.

The configuration interface provides an interface whereby an organization may modify and or control the operation of the recovery network . Each organization not shown to which the recovery network provides recovery services may have respective configuration information associated therewith. The configuration information may be created and edited via the configuration interface . The recovery network may change its operation in real time according to changes to the configuration information made through the configuration interface .

The configuration information of the one or more organizations is stored in a data store . The data store is depicted in as comprising configuration information of a particular organization not shown . The data store may comprise and or be communicatively coupled to data storage media such as but not limited to fixed discs optical media distributed data storage media a storage area network SAN a redundant array of inexpensive discs RAID Flash memory a database a directory service a combination of data storage types or the like. The data store may be implemented using distributed and or redundant data storage media to reduce the risk of data loss due to hardware software faults.

The configuration interface may be accessible via the PCN e.g. may be accessible via a network such as the Internet a phone connection or the like . The configuration interface may provide for activation deactivation of the recovery network for a particular organization. As will be discussed below when the PCN is configured to divert communication requests directed to the organization to the recovery network those communication requests may be processed by the recovery network . The processing may include but is not limited to servicing the communication request using an alternative communication path e.g. a satellite network routing the communication request to an alternative location phone number within the PCN backing up the communication request servicing the communication request e.g. using a phone tree directory or other system provided by the recovery network or the like.

A telecommunications switch or functionally similar module is configured to process communication requests according to the configuration information of a particular organization. The term telecommunications switch is used to illustrate that the communications pathways connected and or processing applied by the telecommunications switch may be dynamically set according to configuration information of an organization e.g. data within the data store which may be updated in real time and or responsive to changing network conditions e.g. availability of various communication paths network congestion and so on . Therefore the operation of the telecommunications switch module may be modified in real time according to the contents of the data store . The telecommunications switch may be implemented as software instructions stored on a computer readable storage media and or in conjunction with one or more hardware components. For instance the telecommunications switch may be implemented within the firmware of a switch device on a computing device communicatively coupled to a configurable switch device as a server computing device using a softswitch device or other components.

The telecommunications switch module is communicatively coupled to the data store and to the PCN interface . The PCN interface discussed below is adapted to configure monitor and or interact with the PCN . Accordingly and as discussed above the PCN interface may include one or more communications interfaces to the PCN such as one or more wireless network connections PSTN connections T1 lines and so on.

When a fault condition occurs the PCN may be configured to divert e.g. forward communication requests intended for the organization to the recovery network . The configuration of the PCN may occur automatically and or manually. As discussed above this may be done using a number of different mechanisms including but not limited to 

In some embodiments the reconfiguration diversion operations described above may be activated manually or automatically using pre existing capabilities within the PCN . In the case of manual activation personnel of the organization and or of the recovery network may interact with the PCN to reconfigure the PCN accordingly. In the case of automatic activation monitoring tools within the PCN may detect a fault condition in the connection between the organization and the PCN which may automatically trigger the diversion of communication requests to a pre determined destination e.g. the recovery network . Alternatively or in addition one or more of the reconfiguration operations described above may be performed programmatically e.g. using one or more Application Programming Interfaces API available within the PCN . For instance in some embodiments the telecommunications switch or other component of the recovery network may be configured to access one or more APIs available through the PCN to perform one or more of the reconfiguration operations described above. In addition the recovery network may include an automated caller system configured to autonomously interact with manual reconfiguration capabilities provided by the PCN e.g. an automated calling system of the recovery network not shown may call into various PCN reconfiguration systems to thereby reconfigure the PCN as described above .

The PCN interface of the recovery network may be further configured to monitor communications within the PCN to detect communication requests intended for the organization and to automatically dynamically or autonomously interact with the manual reconfiguration capabilities provided by the PCN as described above to divert communication requests to the recovery network for processing.

The recovery network may receive forwarded diverted communication requests via multiple paths including but not limited to 

by one or more local carrier connections e.g. from one or more local carriers by one or more long distance carrier connections e.g. from one or more long distance carriers by one or more IP connections e.g. from one or more SIP providers via IP traffic redirected using the IP routing and or DNS and the like.

Therefore the PCN interface may include a service request gateway not shown such as a SIP gateway which may receive VoIP communication requests redirected forwarded from the PCN . The PCN interface may process requests received via the service request gateway e.g. SIP gateway using a media server not shown and or VoIP gateway device not shown . Alternatively or in addition the PCN interface may process VoIP communication requests directly using the media server and VoIP gateway e.g. bypassing the SIP gateway .

The alternative network interface may communicatively couple the recovery network to one or more alternative networks such as emergency services networks dispatch service networks citizen networks or the like. The alternative networks may include one or more RF networks e.g. Citizen Band CB radio ham radio emergency dispatch radio and the like dedicated wireless networks dedicated telephone networks or any other communication infrastructure known in the art. Communication traffic received from an organization e.g. organization of via one or more of the alternative communication paths and or may be forwarded to an alternative network using the alternative network interface . Accordingly the alternative network interface may be configured to convert communication traffic into an appropriate format for one or more of the alternative networks . Similarly the alternative network interface may receive communications directed to the organization from an alternative network convert the communication into an appropriate format and forward the communication to the organization using one or more alternative communication paths and or . The alternative network interface may include one or more RF transponders radios or the like which may be configured to communicate with the alternative networks .

As discussed above the recovery network may process communication requests forwarded from and or detected within the PCN and or alternative networks in a number of different ways. The processing applied by the recovery network may be specified in the configuration information of the organization. In some embodiments the configuration information may include a set of recovery rules which may specify how particular communication requests are to be processed.

The recovery rules may also define handling of IP data. For example a recovery rule may specify that IP traffic directed to a particular address or range of addresses 168.34.231 be serviced on an alternative communication path . Similarly email messages directed to address ranges or particular addresses may be redirected to other locations within a PCN e.g. to an alternative email address or server .

Other recovery rules may specify conversion of a communication request from a first format to a second format. For example the recovery rule specifies that voice communication received on a particular phone number 801 555 1225 be sent to an email address . The rule may cause the recovery network to convert the voice call into audio and or text for delivery to the specified email address . Similarly rules may be specified to deliver voicemail faxes and other communication alerts over email or other network communication types e.g. as Short Message Service SMS text messages instant message IP data or the like .

A recovery rule may further specify that particular communications be backed up for processing at a later time. As will be discussed below the recovery network such as recovery network may include a backup service configured to receive and or record communications data. The rule may specify that communication data voice fax or the like received on a particular range of numbers 801 555 188 be backed up by the recovery network. Therefore as communications data is received on the specified numbers the communication data may not be rerouted to the organization but may be processed and stored by a backup module within the recovery network. The backed up communication data may be processed by the organization at a later time e.g. after normal communications services have been restored . In some embodiments as soon as communication is backed up a notification such as an email text message or the like may be sent to an entity within the PCN or other network indicating that backed up communications are available for retrieval. Further the backed up communications may be attached to the notification for immediate delivery.

As discussed above some communication requests may be handled using services provided by the recovery network recovery network . These services may be configured to emulate the operation of the organization s own communication system. For example the recovery network may provide a dial by extension directory service a dial by name directory service an automated phone tree uniform call distribution UCD automatic call distribution ACD hunting overflow between locations a recorded messaging system or the like. One or more recovery rules may specify particular communication requests to be serviced using one or more of these services provided by the recovery network . For example the recovery rule specifies that communication requests received on a set of numbers calls received on 801 555 199 be processed using an automated calling system e.g. automated calling system org 1 . The automated calling system may be organization specific such that the system may be configured to mimic a calling system of the organization e.g. may use the same prompts interface provide the same options and so on . The automated calling system may be one of several different automated services provided for the organization. For example in the processing rule the automated calling system is specified as org 1 which may specify one of several different automated calling systems provided by the recovery network and configured for the organization e.g. an organization specific technical support calling system information calling system or the like . Additional recovery rules may be provided not shown to specify the use of other types of organization specific services e.g. dial by name directory services phone tree services and so on .

The recovery rules may reference one or more alternative networks. In the example the recovery rule specifies that communication requests directed to an emergency number e.g. 911 are to be forwarded on an alternative network an Emergency Medical Services EMS dispatch network . The EMS dispatch network may be an RF network comprising RF communication at a particular frequency and or channel. Voice communication originating at the organization may be converted into an RF transmission on the EMS dispatch network at the appropriate frequency and or channel and inbound EMS dispatch network traffic may be converted into an appropriate format e.g. voice telephone and forwarded to the organization. In this way the organization may be communicatively coupled to the alternative network EMS dispatch using its own communications infrastructure.

In some embodiments recovery rules may specify multiple different processing directives for the same types of communication requests. For instance the recovery rules may provide for servicing an incoming telephone call using the PCN Internet an alternative communication path and so on. The recovery rules may be applied in order which may be defined by a relative priority assigned thereto. For instance when a communication request is received it may be processed according to the highest priority recovery rule and if the processing is unsuccessful the communication request may be processed according to the next highest priority recovery rule and so on. For example the first highest priority recovery rule may specify that the communication request be routed directly to the organization via an alternate path within the PCN. If the processing is unsuccessful e.g. if the PCN is unavailable and or no one is available to handle the request at the organization then the second next highest priority recovery rule may be applied e.g. the communication request may be routed to the organization over an alternative communication path such as a satellite network and or the Internet . If the second processing is unsuccessful a third recovery rule may be applied e.g. that specifies that the communication request is to be forwarded to another entity within the PCN and so on. Some embodiments may include a default recovery rule which may be used in the event that none of the other recovery rules is capable of successfully processing the request. The default recovery rule may backup the communication request provide a phone tree provide a recorded message or the like.

Although shows an exemplary set of recovery rules in a particular data format one skilled in the art would recognize that the teachings of this disclosure could be applied to any set of processing directives recovery rules stored in any format e.g. as one or more database tables directory entries XML data flat files etc. . Moreover the recovery rules may be adapted for use according to the nature of the communication services provided by the recovery network. In some embodiments the recovery rules may include rules specifying particular processes for handling VoIP communication data voicemail systems automated phone systems automated directory systems and so on. The recovery rules may include a prompt that is presented to the receiver of the redirected communication request that indicates to that receiver the original intended destination of the request so as to enable the receiver to answer the communication request appropriately. The recovery rules may additionally include priority information as discussed below. Therefore this disclosure should not be read as limited to any particular set of recovery rules in any particular recovery rule format.

According to the exemplary recovery rules a communication request directed to 801 555 1223 will first be processed according to the first priority recovery rule e.g. by attempting to service the request using an alternative communication path such as the Internet . If the communication request cannot be serviced using the Internet e.g. if the organization s connection to the Internet is unavailable overly congested the call is not answered or the like the second priority recovery rule may be applied. According to the second priority recovery rule the communication request may be serviced using a satellite network e.g. satellite network of . If the second priority recovery rule is unsuccessful the third recovery rule may be applied which may comprise forwarding the request to another address within the PCN e.g. to 345 555 1349 . In some embodiments a recovery rule such as rule may specify a plurality of different addresses within the PCN a plurality of different phone numbers and or within the recovery network each of which may be tried in succession or in concurrence until the communication request is successfully serviced e.g. until the call is answered at one of the phone numbers . Further if the communication request is a phone call for example the caller may be prompted to select an option that activates a different set of recovery rules. If the recovery rule is unsuccessful the request may be backed up according to the fourth priority recovery rule and if backup is unsuccessful the default recovery rule may direct the request to an automated calling system for the organization as described above.

In some embodiments one or more of the recovery rules and or may further include retry and or timeout values. A retry value may specify how many times a particular type of processing may be retried before moving on to the next lower priority recovery rule. For instance the recovery rule may attempt to connect a communication request via the Internet three times with a pre determined delay between each attempt before failing over to the next recovery rule recovery rule . By the same token when the recovery network has detected and or been informed of a failure in a particular communication path recovery rules specifying the path may be skipped until the path has been restored. For example if the Internet connection to the organization is known to be unavailable the recovery rule may not attempt to service communication requests directed to the organization using the Internet using recovery rule until the Internet connection is available again.

Although the recovery rules in are depicted with respective priority values e.g. 1 through 4 the disclosure is not limited in this regard. In some embodiments particular recovery rules and or processing directives may be automatically assigned a relative priority. For instance recovery rules providing for immediate servicing of an incoming communication request e.g. using the recovery network may have a higher priority over other types of recovery rules. Recovery rules that forward communication requests to other addresses within the PCN may be given the next highest priority since these rules may provide for immediate servicing of the request and other rules such as backup automated phone tree voice mail etc. may be given a lower priority and so on.

Referring back to the telecommunications switch may be configured to process communication requests forwarded from and or detected within the PCN according to the configuration data of the organization. Therefore to determine the appropriate processing e.g. which recovery rule applies to the communication the telecommunications switch identifies the organization and or addresses within the organization to which the communication request was originally directed. This identifying may be performed in a number of different ways. For example each organization serviced by the recovery network may be assigned one or more recovery network specific addresses e.g. access numbers . Therefore for incoming calls faxes forwarded to the recovery network by a carrier the telecommunications switch identifies the organization by the access number on which the calls faxes were received e.g. the caller dials 801 555 1212 which is forwarded by a local carrier to a number 800 666 7890 which is a recovery network access number assigned to the particular organization . The organization associated with incoming calls faxes directed to the recovery network by a toll free carrier may be similarly identified e.g. identified based on the access number assigned to the organization within the recovery network or by pre loading the organization s toll free number s into the recovery network and associating them with the organization then identifying the toll free number dialed by the caller as the call is received by the recovery network . Alternatively or in addition different organizations may share the same access number within the recovery network and may be distinguished using an extension or other qualifier appended thereto during forwarding by the local carrier long distance carrier or the like.

The organization associated with IP traffic may be identified according to routing and or naming information available within the communication request. The routing information may be appended to an IP header on IP packets or other message types. Alternatively or in addition the recovery network may include plural different access addresses e.g. IP addresses to which IP traffic may be forwarded redirected. As such the telecommunications switch may identify the organization associated with IP data based upon the address within the recovery network on which the data was received. Similarly where IP data is routed to the recovery network due to a modification of an address mapping in DNS the organization may be identified based upon the naming information within the data e.g. domain host name within the IP data such as www.organization.com person organization.com or the like .

After determining the organization associated with the communication request the recovery network may be further configured to identify the original destination address e.g. particular phone number such as a Direct Inward Dial number DID within the organization in order to apply a recovery rule or set of rules associated with that specific address. As discussed above an organization may provide plural different access addresses e.g. phone numbers or DIDs through which entities may contact the organization. For example the organization may have addresses phone numbers or DIDs dedicated to providing different types of services such as a direct line to a specific employee customer support new sales providing critical technical support and so on. When active after identifying the original destination address of a communication request a recovery rule within the recovery network may apply a recovery rule that forwards communication requests directed to each of these addresses to a single number assigned to the organization within the recovery network . However the recovery network may require the organization specific number associated with forwarded redirected communication requests to handle the requests accordingly according to the configuration information of the organization . For instance recovery rules within the organization s configuration information may specify that requests directed to a general information number be forwarded to a recorded message and or an automated phone tree whereas requests directed to a critical technical support number may be routed to the organization using an alternative communication path and or to another location within the PCN e.g. a cellular telephone a phone system at another location of the organization or the like .

The recovery network may be configured to identify an organization specific address in a number of different ways including but not limited to 

Upon identifying an organization and or organization specific address of the communication request the telecommunications switch may process the request according to the configuration information e.g. recovery rules of the organization. As described above the recovery rules established by an organization may be configured to mimic the organization s existing communication system. Therefore even during an outage condition the organization may seamlessly communicate with its customers. In addition the recovery rules may be reconfigured automatically or manually e.g. via the configuration interface in real time to allow the organization to adapt to changing conditions. Furthermore the configuration information may include predefined and or sets of predefined recovery plans each of which may be readily available for activation as needed. This may allow the organization to respond quickly to outage conditions to thereby reduce or even eliminate communications service interruptions.

As discussed above a recovery rule may specify that one or more communication requests be attempted to be redirected to alternative addresses within the PCN . The telecommunications switch may be configured to attempt to connect communication requests in a number of different locations devices within the PCN including but not limited to an alternative provider such as a provider or the like a landline a mobile phone an IP phone a VoIP service e.g. Skype Google Talk Google Voice Vonage MagicJack Windows Live Messenger etc. email Short Message Service message SMS a hand held satellite phone a radio system a voicemail system a phone tree an IP address a network server e.g. email server a directory service or the like. The redirection may be performed using any other data routing mechanism and or technique available within the PCN e.g. available via the local carrier long distance carrier SMS 800 database VoIP provider IP routing DNS or the like . In some embodiments redirecting within the PCN and or via an alternative communication path and or may include providing a prompt to the receiver of the communication request e.g. the individual who answers a phone call . The prompt may indicate where the call was originally directed. For example a call intended for an emergency room may be redirected to another phone system e.g. in a receptionist office and before the call is connected the prompt associated with the redirected call may let the receiver know so that the receiver may be prepared to handle the call accordingly. The prompt may be generated automatically and or may be defined by the organization e.g. in the recovery rules described below .

As discussed above the configuration information may also define other communication interfaces phone trees directories and the like to allow the recovery network to emulate the operation of the organization s communication system. For example the organization may include a phone tree dial by name directory dial by extension directory one or more automated attendants music while on hold and the like. The recovery network may be configured provide these services in a way that emulates the operation of the organization s communication system. For example the recovery network may include a dual tone multi frequency DTMF interface a text to speech interface or other interface by which various services may be made available e.g. a dial by directory service an automated attendant and other services . The organization may provide configuration information e.g. via the configuration interface which may configure the recovery network to emulate the operation of the organization s services e.g. provide the same dial by name directory extension directory music on hold and so on . Recovery rules may be defined to process user selections within the various dial by name phone tree and or automated calling system interfaces. In addition the configuration information may include voice recordings and other messages provided by the organization to allow the recovery network to closely emulate organization s communication system e.g. provide callers with same voice prompts used by the organization the same music and so on .

The configuration data of the organization may specify that particular communication requests be attempted to be serviced by one or more alternative communication paths . As shown in in some embodiments the recovery network may include and or be communicatively coupled to a plurality of different alternative communication paths . For instance the recovery network is coupled to a satellite network similar to the satellite network shown and described in a radio transmission communication path and a fiber optic communication path . The alternative communication path module is configured to interact with each of the alternative communication paths to allow the telecommunications switch to redirect and or service communications using one or more of the paths as required. In alternative embodiments such as system of the recovery network may include a single alternative communication path e.g. satellite network or other alternative communication paths in addition to those depicted in . One or more of the alternative communication paths may be dedicated to servicing a particular organization. Alternatively or in addition other alternative communication paths may be shared between a set of organizations and or all of the organizations serviced by the recovery network .

For example during a PCN outage the configuration information of the organization may specify that certain communications e.g. calls to particular telephone numbers network traffic directed to particular addresses etc. be serviced using the satellite network when the PCN is not available.

Referring back to the organization may have installed a satellite interface adapted to receive and or transmit communications requests over a satellite network . The satellite interface may couple the organization s communication system to the satellite network using a gateway e.g. gateway . The gateway may perform various data routing and conversion tasks. For instance the gateway may decompress decrypt and or format communication data e.g. voice IP and the like for use by the organization s communication system e.g. PBX . Similarly the gateway may identify and process IP traffic for use by the computing devices which may include a web server email server personal computing devices and the like. Therefore the satellite network may allow the recovery network to seamlessly provide communications services to the organization using the organization s existing communication system .

The alternative path interface may include similar components. For example the alternative path interface may include a gateway multiplexer not shown to perform data conversions so that incoming communication requests in a first format e.g. TDM may be transmitted in a second format e.g. SIP over the satellite network and then converted back into the first or another format for use by the organization s communication system . In addition gateway and or other hardware components e.g. a VoIP gateway not shown may compress decompress communications data as required to traverse the satellite network or alternative communications paths. Direct VoIP e.g. SIP and or H.323 communication requests may be sent and received directly by a properly configured communication system of the organization e.g. PBX . If the organization s communication system is unable to process direct VoIP the organization may include a VoIP client to process the communication requests.

In addition one or more computing devices not shown may be provided for converting between VoIP e.g. SIP and TDM e.g. ISDN formatted communications. For instance communication data in ISDN format may be converted to SIP for processing by the recovery network e.g. by the telecommunications switch and the like and into ISDN for use by within the PCN .

The telecommunications switch may provide redundant communications services for an organization. As discussed above an organization may provide various different interfaces by which external entities callers may interact with the organization. For example the organization may provide a phone tree dial by name directory dial by extension directory one or more automated attendants call distribution queues conferencing hold music voicemail voice to email or voice to Multimedia Messaging Service MMS voice to SMS etc. fax services faxmail fax to email and the like. The recovery network may provide an equivalent set of services for the organization via the telecommunications switch . The configuration data of the organization may configure the telecommunications switch to emulate the operation of the organization s services e.g. provide an equivalent dial by name directory provide the same set of prompts and or information in a phone tree and so on . As will be discussed below one or more recovery rules of the organization stored in the configuration data may specify that particular types of communication requests e.g. calls to particular numbers be handled using one or more of the services provided by the telecommunications switch e.g. may specify that all calls received on a particular number be serviced by the telecommunications switch which may be configured to provide the caller with a dial by name directory service configured to emulate the organization s directory and so on .

The recovery network may further include a backup module which may include and or be communicatively coupled to a data storage media e.g. data storage media and the PCN interface . When active the backup module may store e.g. backup communication requests e.g. calls faxes email etc. directed to the organization. As discussed above one or more recovery rules of an organization may route certain types of communication requests directly to backup and or attempt multiple alternative communication paths before handling by the backup module . Backed up communication requests may be converted into a data text format for later delivery. In addition the backup module may be used to backup communication requests directed to an organization until one or more alternative communication paths become available.

For example in certain outage conditions an organization may be cut off from the alternative communication paths and or alternative addresses within the PCN for some time e.g. while a connection is being established negotiated while the alternative addresses satellite phones are initialized and so on . While alternative communication paths are intermittently or completely unavailable communication requests directed to the organization may be handled directly by the backup module or by first attempting multiple alternative communication paths according to the recovery rules before handling by the backup module which may backup communication data for delivery to the organization at a later time. Therefore the backup module may include means for receiving and storing communication data including but not limited to a data storage media a voice call recording system a voicemail system e.g. to receive voice communications a phone tree an automated call receiving system a fax receiver an email server an IP proxy an IP cache or the like.

As the organization s alternative communication paths and or alternative addresses within the PCN are available the communication data may be delivered thereto. In some embodiments the backup module may be configured to automatically transmit backed up communications data to the organization when alternative communication means become available e.g. push the backed up data to the organization . Alternatively or in addition the recovery network may issue an alert to the organization indicating that backed up communication data is available. The organization may access the backed up data as it desires e.g. pull backed up data from the recovery network .

At step the method may receive configuration information from an organization e.g. from personnel of the organization . The configuration information may be received via a configuration interface such as the configuration interface discussed above. The configuration interface may be accessible via the PCN as a phone tree a website a human assistant or other interface. Alternatively or in addition the configuration interface may be accessible via one or more alternative communication paths of the recovery network e.g. a satellite network a radio network or the like .

The configuration information received at step may include one or more recovery rules to specify how particular types of communication data are to be processed when recovery services are activated. For example the recovery rules may specify that voice calls received on a particular set of access numbers e.g. phone numbers be routed to other phone numbers within the PCN. Alternatively or in addition the configuration information may specify that calls to specified access numbers should be routed directly to the organization using a selected alternative communication path e.g. a satellite network .

As discussed above the configuration information and recovery rules may include one or more predefined recovery plans each of which may be created modified and or activated in real time. Accordingly changes to the configuration information may modify the behavior of the method as they are applied and or activated. Therefore although shows receiving configuration information as a single step the method may receive configuration information at any time throughout the operation of the method . This real time modification may allow an organization to respond quickly to various outage and or emergency conditions to thereby reduce or eliminate disruptions to the organization s communication systems.

Although method discusses real time changes to configuration information other embodiments in which changes are not applied until approved e.g. by administrators of the method other personnel authorized by the organization or the like could be used under the teachings of this disclosure.

At step the method may await a signal to provide recovery services for an organization. The activation signal may be received via an update to the configuration information of the organization and or may be received via another source such as an alternative communication path an alarm a call to the method manual entry or the like. Alternatively or in addition step may further comprise monitoring the status of the organization s connection to the PCN. The monitoring of step may include but is not limited to periodically pinging the organization to determine whether the communication systems of the organization are operating properly e.g. dialing into one or more phone numbers of the organization transmitting IP traffic to the organization and so on receiving periodic pings from the organization e.g. receiving incoming calls IP traffic and the like from within the organization directly monitoring the organization s communication equipment e.g. via an IP connection a secure IP connection a VPN connection or the like or the like. Upon detecting an interruption in the organization s communication system the method may automatically activate recovery services. Similarly the method may monitor emergency services within the area of the organization. If particular emergency services are activated e.g. power recovery fire alarm etc. the method may be configured to activate one or more portions of the recovery services for the organization e.g. activate hotline forwarding a redundant alternative communication path or the like . In embodiments where the organization s configuration information includes a plurality of different recovery plans the activation signal of step may specify a particular recovery plan to activate.

In other embodiments the method may not require an activation signal. For example the recovery services provided via the method may be always on and available to processing communication requests routed from the PCN. Therefore the activation of the method may consist in configuring the PCN to automatically divert communication requests to the method as discussed below at step upon the detection of a fault condition or by manual diversion using various mechanisms available within the PCN.

At step recovery services may be activated. The activation of step may include configuring the PCN to redirect forward communication requests directed to the organization to the recovery network method . The configuration of the PCN may be performed manually or automatically. For example one or more support personnel of the organization and or recovery network may manually configure various components of the PCN to forward communications requests directed to the organization to the recovery network method . Alternatively one or more of the reconfiguration operations may be performed automatically. The addresses to redirect forward phone number fax number IP address etc. as well as respective destination locations within the recovery network or PCN may be specified in the configuration information. As discussed above the redirection of step may be performed using various different mechanisms. The activation of step may include the activation examples discussed above in conjunction with . These mechanisms may include but are not limited to 

As discussed above PCN configuration of step may be performed manually e.g. by one or more human operators and or may be performed substantially autonomously using interfaces exposed by the PCN e.g. using automated calling systems APIs exposed by the PCN or the like .

The activation of step may further include monitoring communication requests directed to the organization within the PCN. As discussed above the monitoring of step may include but is not limited to monitoring the PCN for incoming calls and or faxes originating from a local phone carrier and or long distance carrier directed to the organization monitoring the PCN for VoIP communication requests e.g. requests transmitted by a SIP provider carrier monitoring IP traffic on the PCN for network data directed to the organization e.g. HTTP requests email messages instant messaging voice data and so on and the like.

At step a communication request may be detected and or diverted to the method from the PCN. Responsive to receiving the communication request the method may access a recovery rule associated with the communication request in the organization s configuration information. At step an organization specific address of the communication e.g. DID may be identified e.g. using OCN RDNIS information DTMF tones from a caller voice recognition human intervention a diversion header e.g. SIP diversion header IP routing information host name information or the like .

Upon determining the organization and or organization specific address of the request the method may process the communication request according to an active recovery rule associated with the request in the organization s configuration information and or determine the appropriate recovery rule based upon one or more caller selections. As discussed above a recovery rule may specify various different processing mechanisms including but not limited to redirecting the communication request to another location and or address within the PCN servicing the communication request e.g. using a phone tree directory or other service provided by the method backing up the communication request transmitting the communication request to the organization using a selected alternative communication path allowing the PCN to operate normally e.g. allowing the PCN to handle the communication request or the like.

The determining of step may include evaluating one or more service limits associated with the organization. For example an organization may be allotted a communication request processing threshold a bandwidth cap on one or more alternative communication paths a storage limit on a backup service or the like. At step these service limits may be evaluated to determine one or more of these limits have been reached. If so the method may modify the processing of the communication request. For example if an organization has exceeded an alternative communication bandwidth cap a communication request which normally would be serviced using an alternative communication path may be routed to a backup service. Similarly if an organization has exceeded its backup storage limit communications requests which would normally be backed up may be routed to an automated processing system e.g. a pre recorded message .

If at step it is determined that the communication request is to be redirected to an alternative address within the PCN the flow may continue at step . If it is determined that the communication request is to be backed up the flow may continue at step . If it is determined that the communication request is to be transmitted to the organization using an alternative communication path the flow may continue at step otherwise if is determined that the communication request should not be processed the flow may continue at step .

At step the communication request may be redirected to another address within the PCN as indicated by the recovery rule associated therewith. The communication request may be routed to any address device coupled to the PCN including but not limited to a landline phone a mobile phone an IP based phone a satellite phone a voicemail system a phone tree an automated phone system a fax machine a call center or the like. After redirecting the communication request the flow may continue at step .

At step the communication request may be directed to a backup service e.g. such as the backup module of . The backup of step may include receiving and or converting the communication request into a format capable of being stored in a data storage media and subsequently delivered to the organization via an alternate communications path such as email. For example a voice call may be converted into an audio message received by a voicemail system directed to an automated calling system for backup or the like. A copy of the audio message may then be immediately sent to the organization via an alternate communications path such as an email with the message attached. Fax data may be similarly received stored and optionally delivered over an alternate path. IP data such as email message instant message and the like may be backed up using an IP proxy caching device or the like.

Alternatively or in addition the backup of step may include playing back a recorded message or other data . The playback of step may not allow a caller to leave a message for the organization. Therefore the playback mechanism may be used where a storage limit for the organization has been reached. The playback message may be provided by the organization and or may include information provided by the method . Following the backup of step the flow may continue to step .

At step an alternative communication path for the communication request may be determined. In some embodiments the organization s configuration information may specify one of more alternative communication paths supported by the organization e.g. may indicate that the organization is coupled to the method via a satellite network a radio network and so on . Alternatively or in addition the recovery rules associated with the communication may specify a particular alternative communication path to use to service some or all communication requests.

In some embodiments the method may monitor the status of one or more of the alternative communication paths. The status information may include a load level of the alternative communication path a link status of particular organizations on the communication path and the like. The path selection of step may use the status information in dynamically selecting an appropriate alternative communication path e.g. may select a path to which the organization is connected has an acceptable load level and the like or step may attempt communication via multiple alternative communication paths while callers wait in queue or the like.

At step the communication request may be serviced on the selected alternative communication path. As discussed above the communication system of the organization may be communicatively coupled to the alternative communication path such that the communication request may be serviced seamlessly over the alternative path e.g. communications may be received and handled at the organization as if the communication request were being serviced by the PCN . In addition the method may include and or be communicatively coupled to integration components e.g. the alternative path interface or and or the satellite interface and gateway of that allow the method to seamlessly transmit PCN data over the alternative communication path. After establishing the connection and or servicing the request using the identified alternative communication path the flow may continue at step .

Although not shown in the processing determined at step may additionally include converting the communication request from a first format into a second format e.g. as discussed above in conjunction with rule of . For example voice call data may be converted into an audio file for backup at step for transmission within the PCN as an email message at step or the like. Similarly communications may be converted for transmission on an alternative network such as an EMS radio dispatch network or the like. Various examples of recovery rules specifying various conversions and or processing directives are provided above in conjunction with e.g. recovery rules and of .

At step the method may determine whether recovery services e.g. the method should continue. The determining of step may include inspecting the configuration data of the organization to determine whether recovery services have been deactivated whether a deactivation signal has been received whether the configuration data has been changed and so on. If recovery services are to continue the flow may return to step where a next communication request may be processed otherwise the flow may continue at step . At step the method may reconfigure the PCN to route communication requests directly to the organization e.g. undo portions of the PCN configuration applied at step .

At steps the method may be initialized receive configuration information from the organization receive an activation signal and configure a PCN to divert forward communications to the method as described above.

At step a communication request may be received and a recovery rule processing directive associated therewith may be identified as described above. The processing of the communication request may be determined by accessing a recovery rule of the organization. As discussed above a communication request may be processed in a number of different ways including but not limited to rerouting the communication request to a specified address within the PCN step backing up the communication request step servicing the communication request using an alternative communication path step allowing the PCN to route the communication request and so on.

At step the method may determine whether the processing determined for the communication request is available. The determining of step may depend upon the nature of the processing identified at step . For example if alternative routing within the PCN is to be performed e.g. at step the determining at step may include determining whether the alternative address is available e.g. whether a forwarding phone number to which the request would be routed is active whether the method is capable of reaching the specified address through the PCN or the like. If the communication request is to be serviced using an alternative communication path the determining may include determining whether one or more acceptable alternative communication paths are available e.g. whether the organization is currently linked to the method using one or more of the alternative communication paths . In addition the determining may include evaluating one or more service limits e.g. bandwidth caps storage thresholds etc. of the organization. If the requested processing type is available the flow may continue as specified at step e.g. to the reroute step of the alternative communication path of step and so on . If the requested processing type is not available the flow may continue at step .

At step the communication request may be backed up. As discussed above backing up a communication request may include receiving and or converting the communication request from a first format into a second storage format e.g. convert a voice call into an audio file a text document or the like . The backed up communication request may be made available to the organization upon establishing an acceptable alternative communication path and or reestablishing service with the PCN. Alternatively or in addition the backup of step may include prompting a caller to provide a callback number. The callback number may be automatically called by the method e.g. by the recovery network and or discussed above when the communications services are restored and the caller may be connected live to the organization via a concurrent or sequential call to the organization via any available communications path e.g. the satellite network PCN etc. .

Following the backup of step or the processing at step the flow continues at step . As described above at step the method determines whether recovery services should continue. If the method is to continue providing recovery services the flow continues to step otherwise the flow continues to step .

At steps the method may be initialized receive configuration information receive an activation signal and configure a PCN to divert forward communications to the method as described above.

At step an incoming communication request from an entity within the PCN or other network directed to the organization may be received. Step may further comprise identifying a plurality of prioritized recovery rules associated with the communication request e.g. in a data structure such as the data structures depicted in and or B . The recovery rules may each specify how the communication request is to be processed and may include different relative priorities. High priority recovery rules may be implemented before low priority rules e.g. a lower priority recovery rule may only be implemented if the communication request cannot be successfully serviced using higher priority recovery rules .

At step one of the plurality of recovery rules may be selected. The selection may be based upon the relative priority of the recovery rules a rule having a higher priority may be selected before a rule having a lower priority. In some embodiments the selection of step may further comprise determining the availability and or load on one or more alternative communication paths. For example if the alternative communication path specified by a higher priority recovery rule is overloaded and or unavailable it may be skipped and another lower priority recovery rule may be used in its place.

Alternatively or in addition a user or other entity may manually specify how the communication request is to be handled. For example if the communication request is a telephone call the caller may be given the option of selecting which processing method should be used to handle the call e.g. using a phone tree or other selection mechanism . If a processing method selected by the user is unsuccessful e.g. as determined at step below the user may be given the opportunity to select a different processing method and or allow the method to select an appropriate processing method as described above.

At step the communication request may be processed according to the selected recovery rule as described above in conjunction with steps and or of and or steps and or of .

At step the method may determine whether the processing of step was successful e.g. whether the communication request was connected or otherwise serviced . If the processing was successful e.g. the telephone call was successfully connected to the organization s equipment or to an individual using an alternative communication path the flow may continue at step otherwise the flow may return to step where another processing method may be selected as described above e.g. the next highest priority recovery rule may be selected and or the originator of the communication request may select another processing option .

At step if the method is to continue providing recovery and backup services the flow may return to step to process a next communication request otherwise the flow may continue to step where the PCN may be reconfigured manually or automatically as described above.
