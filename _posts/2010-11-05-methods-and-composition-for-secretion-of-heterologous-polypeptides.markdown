This application claims priority to U.S. patent application No. 61 258 565 filed on Nov. 5 2009 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention relates generally to the fields of molecular biology and protein technology. More specifically the invention concerns signal sequences for the secretion of heterologous polypeptides from bacteria. The invention also concerns prokaryotically produced recombinant polypeptides and uses thereof.

Secretion of heterologous polypeptides into the periplasmic space of and other prokaryotes or into their culture media is subject to a variety of parameters. Typically vectors for secretion of a polypeptide of interest are engineered to position DNA encoding a secretory signal sequence 5 to the DNA encoding the polypeptide of interest.

Recent years have seen increasing promises of using heterologous polypeptide for example antibodies as diagnostic and therapeutic agents for various disorders and diseases. Many research and clinical applications require large quantities of functional polypeptide thus calling for scaled up yet economic systems for polypeptide production. Particularly useful is the recombinant production of antibodies using a variety of expression hosts ranging from prokaryotes such as or to yeast plants insect cells and mammalian cells. Kipriyanov and Little 1999 12 173 201.

Compared to other polypeptide production systems bacteria particularly provides many unique advantages. The raw materials used i.e. bacterial cells are inexpensive and easy to grow therefore reducing the cost of products. Prokaryotic hosts grow much faster than e.g. mammalian cells allowing quicker analysis of genetic manipulations. Shorter generation time and ease of scaling up also make bacterial fermentation a more attractive means for large quantity protein production. The genomic structure and biological activity of many bacterial species including have been well studied and a wide range of suitable vectors are available making expression of a desirable antibody more convenient. Compared with eukaryotes fewer steps are involved in the production process including the manipulation of recombinant genes stable transformation of multiple copies into the host expression induction and characterization of the products. Pluckthun and Pack 1997 3 83 105.

Various approaches have been used to make recombinant polypeptides in bacteria. Recombinant proteins can be obtained from bacteria either through refolding of inclusion bodies expressed in the cytoplasm or through expression followed by secretion to the bacterial periplasm. The choice between secretion and refolding is generally guided by several considerations. Secretion is usually the faster and more commonly used strategy for producing antibodies. Kipriyanov and Little 1999 supra.

Antibody expression in prokaryotic systems can be carried out in different scales. The shake flask cultures in the 2 5 liter range typically generate less than 5 mg liter products. Carter et al. 1992 10 12 16 developed a high cell density fermentation system in which high level expression up to 2 g liter of antibody fragments was obtained. The gram per liter titers of Fab obtained by Carter et al. is due largely to higher cell densities resulting from the more precisely controlled environment of a fermentor than that of a simple shake flask. The system contains a dicistronic operon designed to co express the light chain and heavy chain fragments. The dicistronic operon is under the control of a single phoA promoter which is inducible by phosphate starvation. Each antibody chain is preceded by the heat stable enterotoxin II stII signal sequence to direct secretion to the periplasmic space.

Many biological assays such as X ray crystallography and clinical applications such as protein therapy require large amounts of protein. Accordingly a need exists for high yield yet simple systems for producing properly assembled soluble and functional heterologous polypeptides such as antibodies.

The term vector as used herein is intended to refer to a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting another nucleic acid to which it has been linked. One type of vector is a plasmid which refers to a circular double stranded DNA loop into which additional DNA segments may be ligated. Another type of vector is a phage vector. Another type of vector is a viral vector wherein additional DNA segments may be ligated into the viral genome. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced e.g. bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors . Other vectors e.g. non episomal mammalian vectors can be integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. Moreover certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as recombinant expression vectors or simply recombinant vectors . In general expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids. In the present specification plasmid and vector may be used interchangeably as the plasmid is the most commonly used form of vector.

The term cistron as used herein is intended to refer to a genetic element broadly equivalent to a translational unit comprising the nucleotide sequence coding for a polypeptide chain and adjacent control regions. Adjacent control regions include for example a translational initiation region TIR as defined herein below and a termination region.

A polycistronic expression vector refers to a single vector that contains and expresses multiple cistrons under the regulatory control of one single promoter. A common example of polycistronic vector is a dicistronic vector that contains and expresses two different polypeptides under the control of one promoter. Upon expression of a dicistronic or polycistronic vector multiple genes are first transcribed as a single transcriptional unit and then translated separately.

A separate cistron expression vector according to the present invention refers to a single vector comprising at least two separate promoter cistron pairs wherein each cistron is under the control of its own promoter. Upon expression of a separate cistron expression vector both transcription and translation processes of different genes are separate and independent.

The translation initiation region or TIR or translational initiation region or translational initiation sequence as used herein refers to a nucleic acid region providing the efficiency of translational initiation of a gene of interest. In general a TIR within a particular cistron encompasses the ribosome binding site RBS and sequences 5 and 3 to RBS. The RBS is defined to contain minimally the Shine Dalgarno region and the start codon AUG . Accordingly a TIR also includes at least a portion of the nucleic acid sequence to be translated. Preferably a TIR of the invention includes a secretion signal sequence encoding a signal peptide that precedes the sequence encoding for the light or heavy chain within a cistron. A TIR variant contains sequence variants particularly substitutions within the TIR region that alter the property of the TIR such as its translational strength as defined herein below. Preferably a TIR variant of the invention contains sequence substitutions within the first 2 to about 14 preferably about 4 to 12 more preferably about 6 codons of the secretion signal sequence that precedes the sequence encoding for the light or heavy chain within a cistron.

The term translational strength as used herein refers to a measurement of a secreted polypeptide in a control system wherein one or more variants of a TIR is used to direct secretion of a polypeptide and the results compared to the wild type TIR or some other control under the same culture and assay conditions. Without being limited to any one theory translational strength as used herein can include for example a measure of mRNA stability efficiency of ribosome binding to the ribosome binding site and mode of translocation across a membrane.

 Secretion signal sequence or signal sequence refers to a nucleic acid sequence encoding for a short signal peptide that can be used to direct a newly synthesized protein of interest through a cellular membrane usually the inner membrane or both inner and outer membranes of prokaryotes. As such the protein of interest such as the immunoglobulin light or heavy chain polypeptide is secreted into the periplasm of the prokaryotic host cells or into the culture medium. The signal peptide encoded by the secretion signal sequence may be endogenous to the host cells or they may be exogenous including signal peptides native to the polypeptide to be expressed. Secretion signal sequences are typically present at the amino terminus of a polypeptide to be expressed and are typically removed enzymatically between biosynthesis and secretion of the polypeptide from the cytoplasm. Thus the signal peptide is usually not present in a mature protein product.

 Operably linked refers to a juxtaposition of two or more components wherein the components so described are in a relationship permitting them to function in their intended manner. For example a promoter is operably linked to a coding sequence if it acts in cis to control or modulate the transcription of the linked sequence. Generally but not necessarily the DNA sequences that are operably linked are contiguous and where necessary to join two protein coding regions or in the case of a secretory leader contiguous and in reading frame. However although an operably linked promoter is generally located upstream of the coding sequence it is not necessarily contiguous with it. Operably linked enhancers can be located upstream within or downstream of coding sequences and at considerable distances from the promoter. Linking is accomplished by recombinant methods known in the art e.g. using PCR methodology by annealing or by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If convenient restriction sites do not exist then synthetic oligonucleotide adaptors or linkers are used in accord with conventional practice.

 Regulatory elements as used herein refer to nucleotide sequences present in cis necessary for transcription and translation of a polynucleotide encoding a heterologous polypeptide into polypeptides. The transcriptional regulatory elements normally comprise a promoter 5 of the gene sequence to be expressed transcriptional initiation and termination sites and polyadenylation signal sequence. The term transcriptional initiation site refers to the nucleic acid in the construct corresponding to the first nucleic acid incorporated into the primary transcript i.e. the mRNA precursor the transcriptional initiation site may overlap with the promoter sequences.

A promoter refers to a polynucleotide sequence that controls transcription of a gene or sequence to which it is operably linked. A promoter includes signals for RNA polymerase binding and transcription initiation. The promoters used will be functional in the cell type of the host cell in which expression of the selected sequence is contemplated. A large number of promoters including constitutive inducible and repressible promoters from a variety of different sources are well known in the art and identified in databases such as GenBank and are available as or within cloned polynucleotides from e.g. depositories such as ATCC as well as other commercial or individual sources . With inducible promoters the activity of the promoter increases or decreases in response to a signal.

The term host cell or recombinant host cell as used herein is intended to refer to a cell that has been genetically altered or is capable of being genetically altered by introduction of an exogenous polynucleotide such as a recombinant plasmid or vector. It should be understood that such terms are intended to refer not only to the particular subject cell but to the progeny of such a cell. Because certain modifications may occur in succeeding generations due to either mutation or environmental influences such progeny may not in fact be identical to the parent cell but are still included within the scope of the term host cell as used herein.

An isolated polypeptide e.g. an antibody is one which has been identified and separated and or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody and may include enzymes hormones and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments the polypeptide will be purified 1 to greater than 95 by weight of polypeptide as determined by the Lowry method and most preferably more than 99 by weight 2 to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator or 3 to homogeneity by SDS PAGE sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing or nonreducing conditions using Coomassie blue or preferably silver stain. Isolated polypeptide includes the polypeptide in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the polypeptide s natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily however isolated polypeptide will be prepared by at least one purification step.

An isolated nucleic acid molecule is a nucleic acid molecule that is identified and separated from at least one contaminant nucleic acid molecule with which it is ordinarily associated in the natural source of the nucleic acid. An isolated nucleic acid molecule is other than in the form or setting in which it is found in nature. Isolated nucleic acid molecules therefore are distinguished from the nucleic acid molecule as it exists in natural cells. However an isolated nucleic acid molecule includes a nucleic acid molecule contained in cells that ordinarily express the nucleic acid for example an antibody encoding nucleic acid where for example the nucleic acid molecule is in a chromosomal location different from that of natural cells.

 Polynucleotide or nucleic acid as used interchangeably herein refer to polymers of nucleotides of any length and include DNA and RNA. The nucleotides can be deoxyribonucleotides ribonucleotides modified nucleotides or bases and or their analogs or any substrate that can be incorporated into a polymer by DNA or RNA polymerase or by a synthetic reaction. A polynucleotide may comprise modified nucleotides such as methylated nucleotides and their analogs. If present modification to the nucleotide structure may be imparted before or after assembly of the polymer. The sequence of nucleotides may be interrupted by non nucleotide components. A polynucleotide may be further modified after synthesis such as by conjugation with a label. Other types of modifications include for example caps substitution of one or more of the naturally occurring nucleotides with an analog internucleotide modifications such as for example those with uncharged linkages e.g. methyl phosphonates phosphotriesters phosphoamidates carbamates etc. and with charged linkages e.g. phosphorothioates phosphorodithioates etc. those containing pendant moieties such as for example proteins e.g. nucleases toxins antibodies signal peptides ply L lysine etc. those with intercalators e.g. acridine psoralen etc. those containing chelators e.g. metals radioactive metals boron oxidative metals etc. those containing alkylators those with modified linkages e.g. alpha anomeric nucleic acids etc. as well as unmodified forms of the polynucleotide s . Further any of the hydroxyl groups ordinarily in present in the sugars may be replaced for example by phosphonate groups phosphate groups protected by standard protecting groups or activated to prepare additional linkages to additional nucleotides or may be conjugated to solid or semi solid supports. The 5 and 3 terminal OH can be phosphorylated or substituted with amines or organic capping group moieties of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms. Other hydroxyls may also be derivatized to standard protecting groups. Polynucleotides can also contain analogous forms of ribose or deoxyribose sugars that are generally known in the art including for example 2 O methyl 2 O allyl 2 fluoro or 2 azido ribose carbocyclic sugar analogs alpha anomeric sugars epimeric sugars such as arabinose xyloses or lyxoses pyranose sugars furanose sugars sedoheptuloses acyclic analogs and a basic nucleoside analogs such as methyl riboside. One or more phosphodiester linkages may be replaced by alternative linking groups. These alternative linking groups include but are not limited to embodiments wherein phosphate is replaced by P O S thioate P S S dithioate O NR amidate P O R P O OR CO or CH formacetal in which each R or R is independently H or substituted or unsubstituted alkyl 1 20 C optionally containing an ether O linkage aryl alkenyl cycloalkyl cycloalkenyl or araldyl.

Such preferred fragments include for example a Fab Fab F ab or F ab 2 leucine zipper LZ fusion and a one armed antibody.

Protein expression refers to conversion of the information encoded in a gene into messenger RNA mRNA and then to the protein.

An immunoconjugate interchangeably referred to as antibody drug conjugate or ADC means an antibody conjugated to one or more cytotoxic agents such as a chemotherapeutic agent a drug a growth inhibitory agent a toxin e.g. a protein toxin an enzymatically active toxin of bacterial fungal plant or animal origin or fragments thereof or a radioactive isotope i.e. a radioconjugate .

A blocking antibody or an antibody antagonist is one which inhibits or reduces biological activity of the antigen it binds. In some embodiments blocking antibodies or antagonist antibodies completely inhibit the biological activity of the antigen.

An agonist antibody as used herein is an antibody which mimics at least one of the functional activities of a polypeptide of interest e.g. HGF .

 Binding affinity generally refers to the strength of the sum total of noncovalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule e.g. an antibody and its binding partner e.g. an antigen . Unless indicated otherwise as used herein binding affinity refers to intrinsic binding affinity which reflects a 1 1 interaction between members of a binding pair e.g. antibody and antigen . The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant Kd . Desirably the Kd is 1 10 1 10 5 10 1 10 3 10 5 10 or even 1 10or stronger. Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art including those described herein. Low affinity antibodies generally bind antigen slowly and tend to dissociate readily whereas high affinity antibodies generally bind antigen faster and tend to remain bound longer. A variety of methods of measuring binding affinity are known in the art any of which can be used for purposes of the present invention. Specific illustrative embodiments are described in the following.

In one embodiment the Kd or Kd value according to this invention is measured by a radiolabeled antigen binding assay RIA performed with the Fab version of an antibody of interest and its antigen as described by the following assay that measures solution binding affinity of Fabs for antigen by equilibrating Fab with a minimal concentration of I labeled antigen in the presence of a titration series of unlabeled antigen then capturing bound antigen with an anti Fab antibody coated plate Chen et al. 1999 J. Mol. Biol. 293 865 881 . To establish conditions for the assay microtiter plates Dynex are coated overnight with 5 g ml of a capturing anti Fab antibody Cappel Labs in 50 mM sodium carbonate pH 9.6 and subsequently blocked with 2 w v bovine serum albumin in PBS for two to five hours at room temperature approximately 23 C. . In a non adsorbant plate Nunc 269620 100 M or 26 pM I antigen are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of interest e.g. consistent with assessment of an anti VEGF antibody Fab 12 in Presta et al. 1997 Cancer Res. 57 4593 4599 . The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight however the incubation may continue for a longer period e.g. 65 hours to insure that equilibrium is reached. Thereafter the mixtures are transferred to the capture plate for incubation at room temperature e.g. for one hour . The solution is then removed and the plate washed eight times with 0.1 Tween 20 in PBS. When the plates have dried 150 l well of scintillant MicroScint 20 Packard is added and the plates are counted on a Topcount gamma counter Packard for ten minutes. Concentrations of each Fab that give less than or equal to 20 of maximal binding are chosen for use in competitive binding assays. According to another embodiment the Kd or Kd value is measured by using surface plasmon resonance assays using a BIAcore 2000 or a BIAcore 3000 BIAcore Inc. Piscataway N.J. at 25 C. with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at 10 response units RU . Briefly carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips CM5 BIAcore Inc. are activated with N ethyl N 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide hydrochloride EDC and N hydroxysuccinimide NHS according to the supplier s instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate pH 4.8 into 5 g ml 0.204 before injection at a flow rate of 5 l minute to achieve approximately 10 response units RU of coupled protein. Following the injection of antigen 1M ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements two fold serial dilutions of Fab 0.78 nM to 500 nM are injected in PBS with 0.05 Tween 20 PBST at 25 C. at a flow rate of approximately 25 l min. In some embodiments the following modifications are used for the surface Plasmon resonance assay method antibody is immobilized to CM5 biosensor chips to achieve approximately 400 RU and for kinetic measurements two fold serial dilutions of target protein are injected in PBST buffer at 25 C. with a flow rate of about 30 l minute. Association rates k and dissociation rates k are calculated using a simple one to one Langmuir binding model BIAcore Evaluation Software version 3.2 by simultaneous fitting the association and dissociation sensorgram. The equilibrium dissociation constant Kd is calculated as the ratio k k. See e.g. Chen Y. et al. 1999 J. Mol. Biol. 293 865 881. If the on rate exceeds 10MSby the surface plasmon resonance assay above then the on rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity excitation 295 nm emission 340 nm 16 nm band pass at 25 C. of a 20 nM anti antigen antibody Fab form in PBS pH 7.2 in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer such as a stop flow equipped spectrophometer Aviv Instruments or a 8000 series SLM Aminco spectrophotometer ThermoSpectronic with a stir red cuvette.

An on rate or rate of association or association rate or k according to this invention can also be determined with the same surface plasmon resonance technique described above using a BIAcore 2000 or a BIAcore 3000 BIAcore Inc. Piscataway N.J. at 25 C. with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at 10 response units RU . Briefly carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips CM5 BIAcore Inc. are activated with N ethyl N 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide hydrochloride EDC and N hydroxysuccinimide NHS according to the supplier s instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate pH 4.8 into 5 m ml 0.2 uM before injection at a flow rate of 5 l minute to achieve approximately 10 response units RU of coupled protein. Following the injection of antigen 1M ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements two fold serial dilutions of Fab 0.78 nM to 500 nM are injected in PBS with 0.05 Tween 20 PBST at 25 C. at a flow rate of approximately 25 l min. In some embodiments the following modifications are used for the surface Plasmon resonance assay method antibody is immobilized to CMS biosensor chips to achieve approximately 400 RU and for kinetic measurements two fold serial dilutions of target protein are injected in PBST buffer at 25 C. with a flow rate of about 30 l minute. Association rates k and dissociation rates k are calculated using a simple one to one Langmuir binding model BIAcore Evaluation Software version 3.2 by simultaneous fitting the association and dissociation sensorgram. The equilibrium dissociation constant Kd was calculated as the ratio k k. See e.g. Chen Y. et al. 1999 J. Mol. Biol. 293 865 881. However if the on rate exceeds 10MSby the surface plasmon resonance assay above then the on rate is preferably determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity excitation 295 nm emission 340 nm 16 nm band pass at 25 C. of a 20 nM anti antigen antibody Fab form in PBS pH 7.2 in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer such as a stop flow equipped spectrophometer Aviv Instruments or a 8000 series SLM Aminco spectrophotometer ThermoSpectronic with a stir red cuvette.

A naked antibody is an antibody that is not conjugated to a heterologous molecule such as a cytotoxic moiety or radiolabel.

An antibody having a biological characteristic of a designated antibody is one which possesses one or more of the biological characteristics of that antibody which distinguish it from other antibodies that bind to the same antigen.

In order to screen for antibodies which bind to an epitope on an antigen bound by an antibody of interest a routine cross blocking assay such as that described in Antibodies A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Ed Harlow and David Lane 1988 can be performed.

To increase the half life of the antibodies or polypeptide containing the amino acid sequences of this invention one can attach a salvage receptor binding epitope to the antibody especially an antibody fragment as described e.g. in U.S. Pat. No. 5 739 277. For example a nucleic acid molecule encoding the salvage receptor binding epitope can be linked in frame to a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide sequence of this invention so that the fusion protein expressed by the engineered nucleic acid molecule comprises the salvage receptor binding epitope and a polypeptide sequence of this invention. As used herein the term salvage receptor binding epitope refers to an epitope of the Fc region of an IgG molecule e.g. IgG IgG IgG or IgG that is responsible for increasing the in vivo serum half life of the IgG molecule e.g. Ghetie et al. 18 739 766 2000 Table 1 . Antibodies with substitutions in an Fc region thereof and increased serum half lives are also described in WO00 42072 WO 02 060919 Shields et al. 276 6591 6604 2001 Hinton 279 6213 6216 2004 . In another embodiment the serum half life can also be increased for example by attaching other polypeptide sequences. For example antibodies or other polypeptides useful in the methods of the invention can be attached to serum albumin or a portion of serum albumin that binds to the FcRn receptor or a serum albumin binding peptide so that serum albumin binds to the antibody or polypeptide e.g. such polypeptide sequences are disclosed in WO01 45746. In one preferred embodiment the serum albumin peptide to be attached comprises an amino acid sequence of DICLPRWGCLW SEQ ID NO 48 . In another embodiment the half life of a Fab is increased by these methods. See also Dennis et al. 277 35035 35043 2002 for serum albumin binding peptide sequences.

By fragment is meant a portion of a polypeptide or nucleic acid molecule that contains preferably at least 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 95 or more of the entire length of the reference nucleic acid molecule or polypeptide. A fragment may contain 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 or 100 200 300 400 500 600 or more nucleotides or 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 120 140 160 180 190 200 amino acids or more.

The terms antibody and immunoglobulin are used interchangeably in the broadest sense and include monoclonal antibodies e.g. full length or intact monoclonal antibodies polyclonal antibodies multivalent antibodies multispecific antibodies e.g. bispecific antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity and may also include certain antibody fragments as described in greater detail herein . An antibody can be human humanized and or affinity matured.

The term variable refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. However the variability is not evenly distributed throughout the variable domains of antibodies. It is concentrated in three segments called complementarity determining regions CDRs or hypervariable regions both in the light chain and the heavy chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the framework FR . The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FR regions largely adopting a sheet configuration connected by three CDRs which form loops connecting and in some cases forming part of the sheet structure. The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR regions and with the CDRs from the other chain contribute to the formation of the antigen binding site of antibodies see Kabat et al. Fifth Edition National Institute of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 . The constant domains are not involved directly in binding an antibody to an antigen but exhibit various effector functions such as participation of the antibody in antibody dependent cellular toxicity.

Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen binding fragments called Fab fragments each with a single antigen binding site and a residual Fc fragment whose name reflects its ability to crystallize readily. Pepsin treatment yields an F ab fragment that has two antigen combining sites and is still capable of cross linking antigen.

 Fv is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen recognition and binding site. In a two chain Fv species this region consists of a dimer of one heavy and one light chain variable domain in tight non covalent association. In a single chain Fv species one heavy and one light chain variable domain can be covalently linked by a flexible peptide linker such that the light and heavy chains can associate in a dimeric structure analogous to that in a two chain Fv species. It is in this configuration that the three CDRs of each variable domain interact to define an antigen binding site on the surface of the VH VL dimer. Collectively the six CDRs confer antigen binding specificity to the antibody. However even a single variable domain or half of an Fv comprising only three CDRs specific for an antigen has the ability to recognize and bind antigen although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.

The Fab fragment also contains the constant domain of the light chain and the first constant domain CH1 of the heavy chain. Fab fragments differ from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxy terminus of the heavy chain CH1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab SH is the designation herein for Fab in which the cysteine residue s of the constant domains bear a free thiol group. F ab antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.

The light chains of antibodies immunoglobulins from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types called kappa and lambda based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains.

Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of immunoglobulins IgA IgD IgE IgG and IgM and several of these can be further divided into subclasses isotypes e.g. IgG IgG IgG IgG IgA and IgA. The heavy chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called and respectively. The subunit structures and three dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known. Antibody fragments comprise only a portion of an intact antibody wherein the portion preferably retains at least one preferably most or all of the functions normally associated with that portion when present in an intact antibody. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab Fab F ab 2 and Fv fragments diabodies linear antibodies single chain antibody molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. In one embodiment an antibody fragment comprises an antigen binding site of the intact antibody and thus retains the ability to bind antigen. In another embodiment an antibody fragment for example one that comprises the Fc region retains at least one of the biological functions normally associated with the Fc region when present in an intact antibody such as FcRn binding antibody half life modulation ADCC function and complement binding. In one embodiment an antibody fragment is a monovalent antibody that has an in vivo half life substantially similar to an intact antibody. For e.g. such an antibody fragment may comprise on antigen binding arm linked to an Fc sequence capable of conferring in vivo stability to the fragment.

The term hypervariable region HVR or HV when used herein refers to the regions of an antibody variable domain which are hypervariable in sequence and or form structurally defined loops. Generally antibodies comprise six hypervariable regions three in the VH H1 H2 H3 and three in the VL L1 L2 L3 . A number of hypervariable region delineations are in use and are encompassed herein. The Kabat Complementarity Determining Regions CDRs are based on sequence variability and are the most commonly used Kabat et al. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 . Chothia refers instead to the location of the structural loops Chothia and Lesk J. Mol. Biol. 196 901 917 1987 . The AbM hypervariable regions represent a compromise between the Kabat CDRs and Chothia structural loops and are used by Oxford Molecular s AbM antibody modeling software. The contact hypervariable regions are based on an analysis of the available complex crystal structures. The residues from each of these hypervariable regions are noted below.

 Framework or FR residues are those variable domain residues other than the hypervariable region residues as herein defined.

 Humanized forms of non human e.g. murine antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non human immunoglobulin. For the most part humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins recipient antibody in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non human species donor antibody such as mouse rat rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity affinity and capacity. In some instances framework region FR residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non human residues. Furthermore humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one and typically two variable domains in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally will also comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region Fc typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details see Jones et al. Nature 321 522 525 1986 Riechmann et al. Nature 332 323 329 1988 and Presta Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. 2 593 596 1992 . See also the following review articles and references cited therein Vaswani and Hamilton Ann. Allergy Asthma Immunol. 1 105 115 1998 Harris Biochem. Soc. Transactions 23 1035 1038 1995 Hurle and Gross Curr. Op. Biotech. 5 428 433 1994 .

 Chimeric antibodies immunoglobulins have a portion of the heavy and or light chain identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass while the remainder of the chain s is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass as well as fragments of such antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 and Morrison et al. 81 6851 6855 1984 . Humanized antibody as used herein is a subset of chimeric antibodies.

 Single chain Fv or scFv antibody fragments comprise the VH and VL domains of antibody wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Generally the scFv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the VH and VL domains which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of scFv see Pluckthun in vol. 113 Rosenburg and Moore eds. Springer Verlag New York pp. 269 315 1994 .

An antigen is a predetermined antigen to which an antibody can selectively bind. The target antigen may be polypeptide carbohydrate nucleic acid lipid hapten or other naturally occurring or synthetic compound. Preferably the target antigen is a polypeptide.

The term diabodies refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen binding sites which fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain VH connected to a light chain variable domain VL in the same polypeptide chain VH VL . By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in for example EP 404 097 WO 93 11161 and Hollinger et al. 90 6444 6448 1993 .

A human antibody is one which possesses an amino acid sequence which corresponds to that of an antibody produced by a human and or has been made using any of the techniques for making human antibodies as disclosed herein. This definition of a human antibody specifically excludes a humanized antibody comprising non human antigen binding residues.

A biologically active or functional polypeptide such as a heterologous polypeptide is one capable of exerting one or more of its natural activities in structural regulatory biochemical or biophysical events.

A biologically active or functional antibody is one capable of exerting one or more of its natural activities in structural regulatory biochemical or biophysical events. For example a biologically active antibody may have the ability to specifically bind an antigen and the binding may in turn elicit or alter a cellular or molecular event such as signaling transduction or enzymatic activity. A biologically active antibody may also block ligand activation of a receptor or act as an agonist antibody. The capability of a antibody to exert one or more of its natural activities depends on several factors including proper folding and assembly of the polypeptide chains. As used herein the biologically active antibody generated by the disclosed methods typically comprise heterotetramers having two identical L chains and two identical H chains that are linked by multiple disulfide bonds and properly folded.

In one aspect the present invention provides TIR variants. Thus for a given TIR a series of amino acid or nucleic acid sequence variants can be created with a range of translational strengths thereby providing a convenient means by which to adjust this factor for the optimal secretion of many different polypeptides. The use of a reporter gene expressed under the control of these variants such as PhoA provides a method to quantitate the relative translational strengths of different translation initiation regions. The variant or mutant TIRs can be provided in the background of a plasmid vector thereby providing a set of plasmids into which a gene of interest may be inserted and its expression measured so as to establish an optimum range of translational strengths for maximal expression of mature polypeptide.

Mutagenesis of the TIR is done by conventional techniques that result in codon changes which can alter the amino acid sequence although silent changes in the nucleotide sequence are preferred. Alterations in the TIR can include for example alterations in the number or spacing of Shine Dalgarno sequences along with alterations in the signal sequence. One method for generating mutant signal sequences is the generation of a codon bank at the beginning of a coding sequence that does not change the amino acid sequence of the signal sequence i.e. the changes are silent . This can be accomplished by changing the third nucleotide position of each codon additionally some amino acids such as leucine serine and arginine have multiple first and second positions that can add complexity in making the bank. This method of mutagenesis is described in detail in Yansura et al. METHODS A Companion to Methods in Enzymol. 4 151 158 1992 . Basically a DNA fragment encoding the signal sequence and the beginning of the mature polypeptide is synthesized such that the third and possibly the first and second as described above position of each of the first 6 to 12 codons is altered. The additional nucleotides downstream of these codons provide a site for the binding of a complementary primer used in making the bottom strand. Treatment of the top coding strand and the bottom strand primer with DNA polymerase I Klenow will result in a set of duplex DNA fragments containing randomized codons. The primers are designed to contain useful cloning sites that can then be used to insert the DNA fragments in an appropriate vector thereby allowing amplification of the codon bank. Alternative methods include for example replacement of the entire rbs with random nucleotides Wilson et al. BioTechniques 17 944 952 1994 and the use of phage display libraries see for example Barbas et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89 4457 4461 1992 Garrard et al. Gene 128 103 109 1993 .

The bacterial Sec translocase facilitates protein export in prokaryotes. Secretory proteins can be targeted to the Sec translocase by two different mechanisms ie the co translational and the post translational targeting. In the latter the signal sequence containing secretory protein is released from the ribosome in its synthesis completed state and directed to the Sec translocase. In various Gram negative bacteria secretory proteins are guided to the Sec translocase by the secretion specific chaperone SecB that maintains these proteins in a translocation competent unfolded state. During co translational targeting the signal recognition particle SRP binds to the signal sequence of the secretory protein while it emerges from the ribosome and the entire ternary complex of SRP ribosome nascent secretory protein chain is targeted to the Sec translocase.

For example the maltose binding periplasmic protein MalE and alkaline phosphatase PhoA signal peptides direct translocation from the cytoplasm to the periplasm in a post translational manner with the aid of the molecular motor SecA. Other exemplary signal peptides that direct translocation in a post translational manner are dsbC lolA ompA lamb and 1 pp. The heat stable enterotoxin II stII and thiol disulfide interchange protein dsbA signal peptides direct translocation in a co translational manner with aid from the signal recognition particle SRP . Other exemplary signal peptides that direct translocation in a co translational manner are yraI tort to 1B sfmC nikA and sfmC. See also Natale et al. for a review of Sec and Tat mediated protein secretion across the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. Natale et al. 2008 Biochemica et Biophysica Acta 1778 1735 56. 

We developed novel variant translational initiation region TIR signal peptide libraries Table 2 for signal peptides representing two of the major secretion pathways for transport across the inner membrane in sec PhoA MalE and SRP DsbA STII . Each library comprises a panel of vectors with comprising variant TIRs of differing translational strengths providing a means by which to readily adjust level of translation for a given protein of interest.

Typically the TIR variants will be provided in a plasmid vector with appropriate elements for expression of a gene of interest. For example a typical construct will contain a promoter 5 to the signal sequence a restriction enzyme recognition site 3 to the signal sequence for insertion of a gene of interest or a reporter gene and a selectable marker such as a drug resistance marker for selection and or maintenance of bacteria transformed with the resulting plasmids. Plasmid vectors are further discussed and exemplified herein. Promoters suitable for use with prokaryotic hosts are known in the art and some are exemplified and described herein.

Any reporter gene may be used which can be quantified in some manner. Thus for example alkaline phosphatase production can be quantitated as a measure of the secreted level of the phoA gene product. Other examples include for example the lactamase genes.

Generally a set of vectors may be generated with a range of TIR strengths for each cistron of the vector therein. This limited set provides a comparison of expression levels of each chain as well as the yield of full length products under various TIR strength combinations. TIR strengths can be determined by quantifying the expression level of a reporter gene as described in detail in Simmons et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 840 523. For the purpose of this invention the translational strength combination for a particular pair of TIRs within a vector is represented by N light M heavy wherein N is the relative TIR strength of light chain and M is the relative TIR strength of heavy chain. For example 3 light 7 heavy means the vector provides a relative TIR strength of about 3 for light chain expression and a relative TIR strength of about 7 for heavy chain expression. Based on the translational strength comparison the desired individual TIRs are selected to be combined in the expression vector constructs of the invention. Vectors so constructed can be used to transform an appropriate host. Preferably the host is a prokaryotic host. More preferably the host is

The secreted level of polypeptides can be determined for example by a functional assays for the polypeptide of interest if available radioimmunoassays RIA enzyme linked immunoassays ELISA or by PAGE and visualization of the correct molecular weight of the polypeptide of interest. Methods for determining level of secreted polypeptide are well known in the art and some are exemplified herein.

For treatment of pathological conditions requiring an antagonistic function and where bivalency of an antibody results in an undesirable agonistic effect the monovalent trait of a one armed antibody i.e. an antibody comprising a single antigen binding arm results in and or ensures an antagonistic function upon binding of the antibody to a target molecule. Furthermore the one armed antibody comprising a Fc region is characterized by superior pharmacokinetic attributes such as an enhanced half life and or reduced clearance rate in vivo compared to Fab forms having similar substantially identical antigen binding characteristics thus overcoming a major drawback in the use of conventional monovalent Fab antibodies.

In one aspect the anti c met antibody comprises at least one characteristic that promotes heterodimerization while minimizing homodimerization of the Fc sequences within the antibody fragment. Such characteristic s improves yield and or purity and or homogeneity of the immunoglobulin populations. In one embodiment the antibody comprises Fc mutations constituting knobs and holes as described in WO2005 063816. For example a hole mutation can be one or more of T366A L368A and or Y407V in an Fc polypeptide and a knob mutation can be T366W. Knob and hole Fc mutations are further described herein.

Monoclonal antibodies are obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies i.e. the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Thus the modifier monoclonal indicates the character of the antibody as not being a mixture of discrete antibodies.

The monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be made using the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al. 256 495 1975 or may be made by recombinant DNA methods U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 .

In the hybridoma method a mouse or other appropriate host animal such as a hamster is immunized to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the protein used for immunization. Antibodies to antigen may be raised in animals by multiple subcutaneous sc or intraperitoneal ip injections of antigen and an adjuvant. Antigen may be prepared using methods well known in the art some of which are further described herein. For example recombinant production of human and mouse antigen is described below. In one embodiment animals are immunized with a antigen fused to the Fc portion of an immunoglobulin heavy chain. In a preferred embodiment animals are immunized with a antigen IgG1 fusion protein. Animals ordinarily are immunized against immunogenic conjugates or derivatives of antigen with monophosphoryl lipid A MPL trehalose dicrynomycolate TDM Ribi Immunochem. Research Inc. Hamilton Mont. and the solution is injected intradermally at multiple sites. Two weeks later the animals are boosted. 7 to 14 days later animals are bled and the serum is assayed for antibody titer. Animals are boosted until titer plateaus.

Alternatively lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro. Lymphocytes then are fused with myeloma cells using a suitable fusing agent such as polyethylene glycol to form a hybridoma cell Goding pp. 59 103 Academic Press 1986 .

The hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused parental myeloma cells. For example if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase HGPRT or HPRT the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine aminopterin and thymidine HAT medium which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT deficient cells.

Preferred myeloma cells are those that fuse efficiently support stable high level production of antibody by the selected antibody producing cells and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. Among these preferred myeloma cell lines are murine myeloma lines such as those derived from MOPC 21 and MPC 11 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center San Diego Calif. USA and SP 2 or X63 Ag8 653 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection Rockville Md. USA. Human myeloma and mouse human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies Kozbor 133 3001 1984 Brodeur et al. pp. 51 63 Marcel Dekker Inc. New York 1987 .

Culture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies directed against antigen. Preferably the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay such as radioimmunoassay RIA or enzyme linked immunoadsorbent assay ELISA .

The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can for example be determined by the Scatchard analysis of Munson et al. 107 220 1980 .

After hybridoma cells are identified that produce antibodies of the desired specificity affinity and or activity the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods Goding pp. 59 103 Academic Press 1986 . Suitable culture media for this purpose include for example D MEM or RPMI 1640 medium. In addition the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites tumors in an animal.

The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium ascites fluid or serum by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as for example protein A Sepharose hydroxylapatite chromatography gel electrophoresis dialysis or affinity chromatography.

The antibodies of the invention can be made by using combinatorial libraries to screen for synthetic antibody clones with the desired activity or activities. In principle synthetic antibody clones are selected by screening phage libraries containing phage that display various fragments of antibody variable region Fv fused to phage coat protein. Such phage libraries are panned by affinity chromatography against the desired antigen. Clones expressing Fv fragments capable of binding to the desired antigen are adsorbed to the antigen and thus separated from the non binding clones in the library. The binding clones are then eluted from the antigen and can be further enriched by additional cycles of antigen adsorption elution. Any of the antibodies of the invention can be obtained by designing a suitable antigen screening procedure to select for the phage clone of interest followed by construction of a antibody clone using the Fv sequences from the phage clone of interest and suitable constant region Fc sequences described in Kabat et al. Fifth Edition NIH Publication 91 3242 Bethesda Md. 1991 vols. 1 3. An exemplary method for generating antibodies is disclosed in the Examples.

The antigen binding domain of an antibody is formed from two variable V regions of about 110 amino acids one each from the light VL and heavy VH chains that both present three hypervariable loops or complementarity determining regions CDRs . Variable domains can be displayed functionally on phage either as single chain Fv scFv fragments in which VH and VL are covalently linked through a short flexible peptide or as Fab fragments in which they are each fused to a constant domain and interact non covalently as described in Winter et al. 12 433 455 1994 . As used herein scFv encoding phage clones and Fab encoding phage clones are collectively referred to as Fv phage clones or Fv clones .

Repertoires of VH and VL genes can be separately cloned by polymerase chain reaction PCR and recombined randomly in phage libraries which can then be searched for antigen binding clones as described in Winter et al. 12 433 455 1994 . Libraries from immunized sources provide high affinity antibodies to the immunogen without the requirement of constructing hybridomas. Alternatively the naive repertoire can be cloned to provide a single source of human antibodies to a wide range of non self and also self antigens without any immunization as described by Griffiths et al. 12 725 734 1993 . Finally naive libraries can also be made synthetically by cloning the unrearranged V gene segments from stem cells and using PCR primers containing random sequence to encode the highly variable CDR3 regions and to accomplish rearrangement in vitro as described by Hoogenboom and Winter 227 381 388 1992 .

Filamentous phage is used to display antibody fragments by fusion to the minor coat protein pIII. The antibody fragments can be displayed as single chain Fv fragments in which VH and VL domains are connected on the same polypeptide chain by a flexible polypeptide spacer e.g. as described by Marks et al. 222 581 597 1991 or as Fab fragments in which one chain is fused to pIII and the other is secreted into the bacterial host cell periplasm where assembly of a Fab coat protein structure which becomes displayed on the phage surface by displacing some of the wild type coat proteins e.g. as described in Hoogenboom et al. 19 4133 4137 1991 .

In general nucleic acids encoding antibody gene fragments are obtained from immune cells harvested from humans or animals. If a library biased in favor of clones targeting a particular antigen is desired the individual is immunized with antigen to generate an antibody response and spleen cells and or circulating B cells other peripheral blood lymphocytes PBLs are recovered for library construction. In a preferred embodiment a human antibody gene fragment library biased in favor of antigen reactive clones is obtained by generating an antibody response in transgenic mice carrying a functional human immunoglobulin gene array and lacking a functional endogenous antibody production system such that antigen immunization gives rise to B cells producing human antibodies against antigen. The generation of human antibody producing transgenic mice is described below.

Additional enrichment for antigen reactive cell populations can be obtained by using a suitable screening procedure to isolate B cells expressing antigen specific membrane bound antibody e.g. by cell separation with antigen affinity chromatography or adsorption of cells to fluorochrome labeled antigen followed by flow activated cell sorting FACS .

Alternatively the use of spleen cells and or B cells or other PBLs from an unimmunized donor provides a better representation of the possible antibody repertoire and also permits the construction of an antibody library using any animal human or non human species in which antigen is not antigenic. For libraries incorporating in vitro antibody gene construction stem cells are harvested from the individual to provide nucleic acids encoding unrearranged antibody gene segments. The immune cells of interest can be obtained from a variety of animal species such as human mouse rat lagomorpha luprine canine feline porcine bovine equine and avian species etc.

Nucleic acid encoding antibody variable gene segments including VH and VL segments are recovered from the cells of interest and amplified. In the case of rearranged VH and VL gene libraries the desired DNA can be obtained by isolating genomic DNA or mRNA from lymphocytes followed by polymerase chain reaction PCR with primers matching the 5 and 3 ends of rearranged VH and VL genes as described in Orlandi et al. . 86 3833 3837 1989 thereby making diverse V gene repertoires for expression. The V genes can be amplified from cDNA and genomic DNA with back primers at the 5 end of the exon encoding the mature V domain and forward primers based within the J segment as described in Orlandi et al. 1989 and in Ward et al. 341 544 546 1989 . However for amplifying from cDNA back primers can also be based in the leader exon as described in Jones et al. 9 88 89 1991 and forward primers within the constant region as described in Sastry et al. . 86 5728 5732 1989 . To maximize complementarity degeneracy can be incorporated in the primers as described in Orlandi et al. 1989 or Sastry et al. 1989 . Preferably the library diversity is maximized by using PCR primers targeted to each V gene family in order to amplify all available VH and VL arrangements present in the immune cell nucleic acid sample e.g. as described in the method of Marks et al. 222 581 597 1991 or as described in the method of Orum et al. 21 4491 4498 1993 . For cloning of the amplified DNA into expression vectors rare restriction sites can be introduced within the PCR primer as a tag at one end as described in Orlandi et al. 1989 or by further PCR amplification with a tagged primer as described in Clackson et al. 352 624 628 1991 .

Repertoires of synthetically rearranged V genes can be derived in vitro from V gene segments. Most of the human VH gene segments have been cloned and sequenced reported in Tomlinson et al. 227 776 798 1992 and mapped reported in Matsuda et al. 3 88 94 1993 these cloned segments including all the major conformations of the H1 and H2 loop can be used to generate diverse VH gene repertoires with PCR primers encoding H3 loops of diverse sequence and length as described in Hoogenboom and Winter 227 381 388 1992 . VH repertoires can also be made with all the sequence diversity focused in a long H3 loop of a single length as described in Barbas et al. 89 4457 4461 1992 . Human V and V segments have been cloned and sequenced reported in Williams and Winter 23 1456 1461 1993 and can be used to make synthetic light chain repertoires. Synthetic V gene repertoires based on a range of VH and VL folds and L3 and H3 lengths will encode antibodies of considerable structural diversity. Following amplification of V gene encoding DNAs germline V gene segments can be rearranged in vitro according to the methods of Hoogenboom and Winter 227 381 388 1992 .

Repertoires of antibody fragments can be constructed by combining VH and VL gene repertoires together in several ways. Each repertoire can be created in different vectors and the vectors recombined in vitro e.g. as described in Hogrefe et al. 128 119 126 1993 or in vivo by combinatorial infection e.g. the loxP system described in Waterhouse et al. 21 2265 2266 1993 . The in vivo recombination approach exploits the two chain nature of Fab fragments to overcome the limit on library size imposed by transformation efficiency. Naive VH and VL repertoires are cloned separately one into a phagemid and the other into a phage vector. The two libraries are then combined by phage infection of phagemid containing bacteria so that each cell contains a different combination and the library size is limited only by the number of cells present about 10clones . Both vectors contain in vivo recombination signals so that the VH and VL genes are recombined onto a single replicon and are co packaged into phage virions. These huge libraries provide large numbers of diverse antibodies of good affinity Kof about 10M .

Alternatively the repertoires may be cloned sequentially into the same vector e.g. as described in Barbas et al. 88 7978 7982 1991 or assembled together by PCR and then cloned e.g. as described in Clackson et al. 352 624 628 1991 . PCR assembly can also be used to join VH and VL DNAs with DNA encoding a flexible peptide spacer to form single chain Fv scFv repertoires. In yet another technique in cell PCR assembly is used to combine VH and VL genes within lymphocytes by PCR and then clone repertoires of linked genes as described in Embleton et al. 20 3831 3837 1992 .

The antibodies produced by naive libraries either natural or synthetic can be of moderate affinity kof about 10to 10M but affinity maturation can also be mimicked in vitro by constructing and reselecting from secondary libraries as described in Winter et al. 1994 supra. For example mutations can be introduced at random in vitro by using error prone polymerase reported in Leung et al. 1 11 15 1989 in the method of Hawkins et al. 226 889 896 1992 or in the method of Gram et al. 89 3576 3580 1992 . Additionally affinity maturation can be performed by randomly mutating one or more CDRs e.g. using PCR with primers carrying random sequence spanning the CDR of interest in selected individual Fv clones and screening for higher affinity clones. WO 96 07754 published 14 Mar. 1996 described a method for inducing mutagenesis in a complementarity determining region of an immunoglobulin light chain to create a library of light chain genes. Another effective approach is to recombine the VH or VL domains selected by phage display with repertoires of naturally occurring V domain variants obtained from unimmunized donors and screen for higher affinity in several rounds of chain reshuffling as described in Marks et al. 10 779 783 1992 . This technique allows the production of antibodies and antibody fragments with affinities in the 10M range.

Nucleic acid sequence encoding the desired target antigen can be designed using the amino acid sequence of the desired region of antigen.

Nucleic acids encoding target antigen can be prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include but are not limited to chemical synthesis by any of the methods described in Engels et al. 28 716 734 1989 such as the triester phosphite phosphoramidite and H phosphonate methods. In one embodiment codons preferred by the expression host cell are used in the design of the antigen encoding DNA. Alternatively DNA encoding the antigen can be isolated from a genomic or cDNA library.

Following construction of the DNA molecule encoding the antigen the DNA molecule is operably linked to an expression control sequence in an expression vector such as a plasmid wherein the control sequence is recognized by a host cell transformed with the vector. In general plasmid vectors contain replication and control sequences which are derived from species compatible with the host cell. The vector ordinarily carries a replication site as well as sequences which encode proteins that are capable of providing phenotypic selection in transformed cells. Suitable vectors for expression in prokaryotic and eukaryotic host cells are known in the art and some are further described herein. Eukaryotic organisms such as yeasts or cells derived from multicellular organisms such as mammals may be used.

Optionally the DNA encoding the antigen is operably linked to a secretory leader sequence resulting in secretion of the expression product by the host cell into the culture medium. Examples of secretory leader sequences include stII ecotin lamB herpes GD lpp alkaline phosphatase invertase and alpha factor. Also suitable for use herein is the 36 amino acid leader sequence of protein A Abrahmsen et al. 4 3901 1985 .

Host cells are transfected and preferably transformed with the above described expression or cloning vectors of this invention and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters selecting transformants or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.

Transfection refers to the taking up of an expression vector by a host cell whether or not any coding sequences are in fact expressed. Numerous methods of transfection are known to the ordinarily skilled artisan for example CaPOprecipitation and electroporation. Successful transfection is generally recognized when any indication of the operation of this vector occurs within the host cell. Methods for transfection are well known in the art and some are further described herein.

Transformation means introducing DNA into an organism so that the DNA is replicable either as an extrachromosomal element or by chromosomal integrant. Depending on the host cell used transformation is done using standard techniques appropriate to such cells. Methods for transformation are well known in the art and some are further described herein.

Prokaryotic host cells used to produce the antigen can be cultured as described generally in Sambrook et al. supra.

The mammalian host cells used to produce the antigen can be cultured in a variety of media which is well known in the art and some of which is described herein.

The host cells referred to in this disclosure encompass cells in in vitro culture as well as cells that are within a host animal.

Purification of antigen may be accomplished using art recognized methods some of which are described herein.

The purified antigen can be attached to a suitable matrix such as agarose beads acrylamide beads glass beads cellulose various acrylic copolymers hydroxyl methacrylate gels polyacrylic and polymethacrylic copolymers nylon neutral and ionic carriers and the like for use in the affinity chromatographic separation of phage display clones. Attachment of the antigen protein to the matrix can be accomplished by the methods described in vol. 44 1976 . A commonly employed technique for attaching protein ligands to polysaccharide matrices e.g. agarose dextran or cellulose involves activation of the carrier with cyanogen halides and subsequent coupling of the peptide ligand s primary aliphatic or aromatic amines to the activated matrix.

Alternatively antigen can be used to coat the wells of adsorption plates expressed on host cells affixed to adsorption plates or used in cell sorting or conjugated to biotin for capture with streptavidin coated beads or used in any other art known method for panning phage display libraries.

The phage library samples are contacted with immobilized antigen under conditions suitable for binding of at least a portion of the phage particles with the adsorbent. Normally the conditions including pH ionic strength temperature and the like are selected to mimic physiological conditions. The phages bound to the solid phase are washed and then eluted by acid e.g. as described in Barbas et al. 88 7978 7982 1991 or by alkali e.g. as described in Marks et al. 222 581 597 1991 or by antigen competition e.g. in a procedure similar to the antigen competition method of Clackson et al. 352 624 628 1991 . Phages can be enriched 20 1.000 fold in a single round of selection. Moreover the enriched phages can be grown in bacterial culture and subjected to further rounds of selection.

The efficiency of selection depends on many factors including the kinetics of dissociation during washing and whether multiple antibody fragments on a single phage can simultaneously engage with antigen. Antibodies with fast dissociation kinetics and weak binding affinities can be retained by use of short washes multivalent phage display and high coating density of antigen in solid phase. The high density not only stabilizes the phage through multivalent interactions but favors rebinding of phage that has dissociated. The selection of antibodies with slow dissociation kinetics and good binding affinities can be promoted by use of long washes and monovalent phage display as described in Bass et al. 8 309 314 1990 and in WO 92 09690 and a low coating density of antigen as described in Marks et al. 10 779 783 1992 .

It is possible to select between phage antibodies of different affinities even with affinities that differ slightly for antigen. However random mutation of a selected antibody e.g. as performed in some of the affinity maturation techniques described above is likely to give rise to many mutants most binding to antigen and a few with higher affinity. With limiting antigen rare high affinity phage could be competed out. To retain all the higher affinity mutants phages can be incubated with excess biotinylated antigen but with the biotinylated antigen at a concentration of lower molarity than the target molar affinity constant for antigen. The high affinity binding phages can then be captured by streptavidin coated paramagnetic beads. Such equilibrium capture allows the antibodies to be selected according to their affinities of binding with sensitivity that permits isolation of mutant clones with as little as two fold higher affinity from a great excess of phages with lower affinity. Conditions used in washing phages bound to a solid phase can also be manipulated to discriminate on the basis of dissociation kinetics.

Antigen clones may be activity selected. Fv clones corresponding to such antigen antibodies can be selected by 1 isolating antigen clones from a phage library as described above and optionally amplifying the isolated population of phage clones by growing up the population in a suitable bacterial host 2 selecting antigen and a second protein against which blocking and non blocking activity respectively is desired 3 adsorbing the antigen binding phage clones to immobilized antigen 4 using an excess of the second protein to elute any undesired clones that recognize antigen binding determinants which overlap or are shared with the binding determinants of the second protein and 5 eluting the clones which remain adsorbed following step 4 . Optionally clones with the desired blocking non blocking properties can be further enriched by repeating the selection procedures described herein one or more times.

DNA encoding the hybridoma derived monoclonal antibodies or phage display Fv clones of the invention is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures e.g. by using oligonucleotide primers designed to specifically amplify the heavy and light chain coding regions of interest from hybridoma or phage DNA template . Once isolated the DNA can be placed into expression vectors which are then transfected into host cells such as cells simian COS cells Chinese hamster ovary CHO cells or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein to obtain the synthesis of the desired monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. Review articles on recombinant expression in bacteria of antibody encoding DNA include Skerra et al. 5 256 1993 and Pluckthun 130 151 1992 .

DNA encoding the Fv clones of the invention can be combined with known DNA sequences encoding heavy chain and or light chain constant regions e.g. the appropriate DNA sequences can be obtained from Kabat et al. supra to form clones encoding full or partial length heavy and or light chains. It will be appreciated that constant regions of any isotype can be used for this purpose including IgG IgM IgA IgD and IgE constant regions and that such constant regions can be obtained from any human or animal species. A Fv clone derived from the variable domain DNA of one animal such as human species and then fused to constant region DNA of another animal species to form coding sequence s for hybrid full length heavy chain and or light chain is included in the definition of chimeric and hybrid antibody as used herein. In a preferred embodiment a Fv clone derived from human variable DNA is fused to human constant region DNA to form coding sequence s for all human full or partial length heavy and or light chains.

DNA encoding antibody derived from a hybridoma of the invention can also be modified for example by substituting the coding sequence for human heavy and light chain constant domains in place of homologous murine sequences derived from the hybridoma clone e.g. as in the method of Morrison et al. 81 6851 6855 1984 . DNA encoding a hybridoma or Fv clone derived antibody or fragment can be further modified by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non immunoglobulin polypeptide. In this manner chimeric or hybrid antibodies are prepared that have the binding specificity of the Fv clone or hybridoma clone derived antibodies of the invention.

The present invention is applicable to antibodies of any appropriate antigen binding specificity. Preferably the antibodies of the invention are specific to antigens that are biologically important polypeptides. More preferably the antibodies of the invention are useful for therapy or diagnosis of diseases or disorders in a mammal. Non limiting examples of therapeutic antibodies include anti VEGF anti c met anti IgE anti CD11 anti CD18 anti CD40 anti tissue factor TF anti HER2 and anti TrkC antibodies. Antibodies directed against non polypeptide antigens such as tumor associated glycolipid antigens are also contemplated.

Where the antigen is a polypeptide it may be a transmembrane molecule e.g. receptor such as a receptor tyrosine kinase or a ligand such as a growth factor. Exemplary antigens include molecules such as renin a growth hormone including human growth hormone and bovine growth hormone growth hormone releasing factor parathyroid hormone thyroid stimulating hormone lipoproteins alpha 1 antitrypsin insulin A chain insulin B chain proinsulin follicle stimulating hormone calcitonin luteinizing hormone glucagon clotting factors such as factor VIIIC factor IX tissue factor TF and von Willebrands factor anti clotting factors such as Protein C atrial natriuretic factor lung surfactant a plasminogen activator such as urokinase or human urine or tissue type plasminogen activator t PA bombesin thrombin hemopoietic growth factor tumor necrosis factor alpha and beta enkephalinase RANTES regulated on activation normally T cell expressed and secreted human macrophage inflammatory protein MIP 1 alpha a serum albumin such as human serum albumin Muellerian inhibiting substance relaxin A chain relaxin B chain prorelaxin mouse gonadotropin associated peptide a microbial protein such as beta lactamase DNase IgE a cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen CTLA such as CTLA 4 inhibin activin vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF receptors for hormones or growth factors protein A or D rheumatoid factors a neurotrophic factor such as bone derived neurotrophic factor BDNF neurotrophin 3 4 5 or 6 NT 3 NT 4 NT 5 or NT 6 or a nerve growth factor such as NGF 13 platelet derived growth factor PDGF fibroblast growth factor such as aFGF and bFGF epidermal growth factor EGF transforming growth factor TGF such as TGF alpha and TGF beta including TGF 1 TGF 2 TGF 3 TGF 4 or TGF 5 insulin like growth factor I and II IGF I and IGF II des 1 3 IGF I brain IGF I insulin like growth factor binding proteins CD proteins such as CD3 CD4 CD8 CD19 CD20 and CD40 erythropoietin osteoinductive factors immunotoxins a bone morphogenetic protein BMP an interferon such as interferon alpha beta and gamma colony stimulating factors CSFs e.g. M CSF GM CSF and G CSF interleukins ILs e.g. IL 1 to IL 10 superoxide dismutase T cell receptors surface membrane proteins decay accelerating factor viral antigen such as for example a portion of the AIDS envelope transport proteins homing receptors addressins regulatory proteins integrins such as CD11a CD11b CD11c CD18 an ICAM VLA 4 and VCAM a tumor associated antigen such as HER2 HER3 or HER4 receptor and fragments of any of the above listed polypeptides.

Exemplary antigens for antibodies encompassed by the present invention include CD proteins such as CD3 CD4 CD8 CD19 CD20 CD34 and CD46 members of the ErbB receptor family such as the EGF receptor HER2 HER3 or HER4 receptor cell adhesion molecules such as LFA 1 Mac1 p150.95 VLA 4 ICAM 1 VCAM 4 7 integrin and v 3 integrin including either or subunits thereof e.g. anti CD11a anti CD18 or anti CD11b antibodies growth factors such as VEGF tissue factor TF TGF alpha interferon IFN an interleukin such as IL 8 IgE blood group antigens Apo2 death receptor flk2 flt3 receptor obesity OB receptor mpl receptor CTLA 4 protein C etc. In some embodiments the antibody of the invention binds in some embodiments specifically binds c met.

The present invention encompasses antibody fragments. In certain circumstances there are advantages of using antibody fragments rather than whole antibodies. The smaller size of the fragments allows for rapid clearance and may lead to improved access to solid tumors.

Various techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments. Traditionally these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies see e.g. Morimoto et al. Journal of Biochemical and Biophysical Methods 24 107 117 1992 and Brennan et al. Science 229 81 1985 . However these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells. Fab Fv and ScFv antibody fragments can all be expressed in and secreted from thus allowing the facile production of large amounts of these fragments. Antibody fragments can be isolated from the antibody phage libraries discussed above. Alternatively Fab SH fragments can be directly recovered from and chemically coupled to form F ab fragments Carter et al. Bio Technology 10 163 167 1992 . According to another approach F ab fragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Fab and F ab fragment with increased in vivo half life comprising a salvage receptor binding epitope residues are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 869 046. Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner. In other embodiments the antibody of choice is a single chain Fv fragment scFv see e.g. WO 93 16185 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 571 894 and 5 587 458 . Fv and sFv are the only species with intact combining sites that are devoid of constant regions thus they are suitable for reduced nonspecific binding during in vivo use. sFv fusion proteins may be constructed to yield fusion of an effector protein at either the amino or the carboxy terminus of an sFv. See Antibody Engineering ed. Borrebaeck supra. The antibody fragment may also be a linear antibody e.g. as described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5 641 870. Such linear antibody fragments may be monospecific or bispecific.

Accordingly in some embodiment the anti c met antibody is a one armed antibody i.e. the heavy chain variable domain and the light chain variable domain form a single antigen binding arm comprising an Fc region wherein the Fc region comprises a first and a second Fc polypeptide wherein the first and second Fc polypeptides are present in a complex and form a Fc region that increases stability of said antibody fragment compared to a Fab molecule comprising said antigen binding arm. One armed antibodies are further described herein.

The present invention encompasses humanized antibodies. Various methods for humanizing non human antibodies are known in the art. For example a humanized antibody can have one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non human. These non human amino acid residues are often referred to as import residues which are typically taken from an import variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co workers Jones et al. 1986 321 522 525 Riechmann et al. 1988 332 323 327 Verhoeyen et al. 1988 239 1534 1536 by substituting hypervariable region sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly such humanized antibodies are chimeric antibodies U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non human species. In practice humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some hypervariable region residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.

The choice of human variable domains both light and heavy to be used in making the humanized antibodies is very important to reduce antigenicity. According to the so called best fit method the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire library of known human variable domain sequences. The human sequence which is closest to that of the rodent is then accepted as the human framework for the humanized antibody Sims et al. 1993 151 2296 Chothia et al. 1987 196 901. Another method uses a particular framework derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework may be used for several different humanized antibodies Carter et al. 1992 89 4285 Presta et al. 1993 151 2623.

It is further important that antibodies be humanized with retention of high affinity for the antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal according to one method humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence i.e. the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way FR residues can be selected and combined from the recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic such as increased affinity for the target antigen s is achieved. In general the hypervariable region residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding. Human Antibodies

Human antibodies of the invention can be constructed by combining Fv clone variable domain sequence s selected from human derived phage display libraries with known human constant domain sequences s as described above. Alternatively human monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be made by the hybridoma method. Human myeloma and mouse human heteromyeloma cell lines for the production of human monoclonal antibodies have been described for example by Kozbor 133 3001 1984 Brodeur et al. pp. 51 63 Marcel Dekker Inc. New York 1987 and Boerner et al. 147 86 1991 .

It is now possible to produce transgenic animals e.g. mice that are capable upon immunization of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. For example it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy chain joining region JH gene in chimeric and germ line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production. Transfer of the human germ line immunoglobulin gene array in such germ line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge. See e.g. Jakobovits et al. 90 2551 1993 Jakobovits et al. 362 255 1993 Bruggermann et al. 7 33 1993 .

Gene shuffling can also be used to derive human antibodies from non human e.g. rodent antibodies where the human antibody has similar affinities and specificities to the starting non human antibody. According to this method which is also called epitope in imprinting either the heavy or light chain variable region of a non human antibody fragment obtained by phage display techniques as described above is replaced with a repertoire of human V domain genes creating a population of non human chain human chain scFv or Fab chimeras. Selection with antigen results in isolation of a non human chain human chain chimeric scFv or Fab wherein the human chain restores the antigen binding site destroyed upon removal of the corresponding non human chain in the primary phage display clone i.e. the epitope governs imprints the choice of the human chain partner. When the process is repeated in order to replace the remaining non human chain a human antibody is obtained see PCT WO 93 06213 published Apr. 1 1993 . Unlike traditional humanization of non human antibodies by CDR grafting this technique provides completely human antibodies which have no FR or CDR residues of non human origin.

Bispecific antibodies are monoclonal preferably human or humanized antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different antigens. In the present case one of the binding specificities is for antigen and the other is for any other antigen. Exemplary bispecific antibodies may bind to two different epitopes of the antigen. Bispecific antibodies may also be used to localize cytotoxic agents to cells which express antigen. These antibodies possess a antigen binding arm and an arm which binds the cytotoxic agent e.g. saporin anti interferon vinca alkaloid ricin A chain methotrexate or radioactive isotope hapten . Bispecific antibodies can be prepared as full length antibodies or antibody fragments e.g. F ab bispecific antibodies .

Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditionally the recombinant production of bispecific antibodies is based on the co expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain light chain pairs where the two heavy chains have different specificities Milstein and Cuello 305 537 1983 . Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains these hybridomas quadromas produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. The purification of the correct molecule which is usually done by affinity chromatography steps is rather cumbersome and the product yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 93 08829 published May 13 1993 and in Traunecker et al. 10 3655 1991 .

According to a different and more preferred approach antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities antibody antigen combining sites are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion preferably is with an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domain comprising at least part of the hinge CH2 and CH3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy chain constant region CH1 containing the site necessary for light chain binding present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and if desired the immunoglobulin light chain are inserted into separate expression vectors and are co transfected into a suitable host organism. This provides for great flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yields. It is however possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains in one expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios are of no particular significance.

In a preferred embodiment of this approach the bispecific antibodies are composed of a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain light chain pair providing a second binding specificity in the other arm. It was found that this asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation. This approach is disclosed in WO 94 04690. For further details of generating bispecific antibodies see for example Suresh et al. 121 210 1986 .

According to another approach the interface between a pair of antibody molecules can be engineered to maximize the percentage of heterodimers which are recovered from recombinant cell culture. The preferred interface comprises at least a part of the C3 domain of an antibody constant domain. In this method one or more small amino acid side chains from the interface of the first antibody molecule are replaced with larger side chains e.g. tyrosine or tryptophan knobs or protuberances . Compensatory cavities holes of identical or similar size to the large side chain s are created on the interface of the second antibody molecule by replacing large amino acid side chains with smaller ones e.g. alanine or threonine . This provides a mechanism for increasing the yield of the heterodimer over other unwanted end products such as homodimers. Knobs and holes are further described herein.

Bispecific antibodies include cross linked or heteroconjugate antibodies. For example one of the antibodies in the heteroconjugate can be coupled to avidin the other to biotin. Such antibodies have for example been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 and for treatment of HIV infection WO 91 00360 WO 92 00373 and EP 03089 . Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using any convenient cross linking methods. Suitable cross linking agents are well known in the art and are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 along with a number of cross linking techniques.

Techniques for generating bispecific antibodies from antibody fragments have also been described in the literature. For example bispecific antibodies can be prepared using chemical linkage. Brennan et al. 229 81 1985 describe a procedure wherein intact antibodies are proteolytically cleaved to generate F ab fragments. These fragments are reduced in the presence of the dithiol complexing agent sodium arsenite to stabilize vicinal dithiols and prevent intermolecular disulfide formation. The Fab fragments generated are then converted to thionitrobenzoate TNB derivatives. One of the Fab TNB derivatives is then reconverted to the Fab thiol by reduction with mercaptoethylamine and is mixed with an equimolar amount of the other Fab TNB derivative to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibodies produced can be used as agents for the selective immobilization of enzymes.

Recent progress has facilitated the direct recovery of Fab SH fragments from which can be chemically coupled to form bispecific antibodies. Shalaby et al. 175 217 225 1992 describe the production of a fully humanized bispecific antibody F ab molecule. Each Fab fragment was separately secreted from and subjected to directed chemical coupling in vitro to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibody thus formed was able to bind to cells overexpressing the HER2 receptor and normal human T cells as well as trigger the lytic activity of human cytotoxic lymphocytes against human breast tumor targets.

Various techniques for making and isolating bispecific antibody fragments directly from recombinant cell culture have also been described. For example bispecific antibodies have been produced using leucine zippers. Kostelny et al. 148 5 1547 1553 1992 . The leucine zipper peptides from the Fos and Jun proteins were linked to the Fab portions of two different antibodies by gene fusion. The antibody homodimers were reduced at the hinge region to form monomers and then re oxidized to form the antibody heterodimers. This method can also be utilized for the production of antibody homodimers. The diabody technology described by Hollinger et al. 90 6444 6448 1993 has provided an alternative mechanism for making bispecific antibody fragments. The fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain VH connected to a light chain variable domain VL by a linker which is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain. Accordingly the VH and VL domains of one fragment are forced to pair with the complementary VL and VH domains of another fragment thereby forming two antigen binding sites. Another strategy for making bispecific antibody fragments by the use of single chain Fv sFv dimers has also been reported. See Gruber et al. 152 5368 1994 .

Antibodies with more than two valencies are contemplated. For example trispecific antibodies can be prepared. Tutt et al. 147 60 1991 .

A multivalent antibody may be internalized and or catabolized faster than a bivalent antibody by a cell expressing an antigen to which the antibodies bind. The antibodies of the present invention can be multivalent antibodies which are other than of the IgM class with three or more antigen binding sites e.g. tetravalent antibodies which can be readily produced by recombinant expression of nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide chains of the antibody. The multivalent antibody can comprise a dimerization domain and three or more antigen binding sites. The preferred dimerization domain comprises or consists of an Fc region or a hinge region. In this scenario the antibody will comprise an Fc region and three or more antigen binding sites amino terminal to the Fe region. The preferred multivalent antibody herein comprises or consists of three to about eight but preferably four antigen binding sites. The multivalent antibody comprises at least one polypeptide chain and preferably two polypeptide chains wherein the polypeptide chain s comprise two or more variable domains. For instance the polypeptide chain s may comprise VD1 X1 n VD2 X2 n Fc wherein VD1 is a first variable domain VD2 is a second variable domain Fc is one polypeptide chain of an Fc region X1 and X2 represent an amino acid or polypeptide and n is 0 or 1. For instance the polypeptide chain s may comprise VH CH1 flexible linker VH CH1 Fc region chain or VH CH1 VH CH1 Fc region chain. The multivalent antibody herein preferably further comprises at least two and preferably four light chain variable domain polypeptides. The multivalent antibody herein may for instance comprise from about two to about eight light chain variable domain polypeptides. The light chain variable domain polypeptides contemplated here comprise a light chain variable domain and optionally further comprise a CL domain.

In some embodiments amino acid sequence modification s of the antibodies described herein are contemplated. For example it may be desirable to improve the binding affinity and or other biological properties of the antibody. Amino acid sequence variants of the antibody are prepared by introducing appropriate nucleotide changes into the antibody nucleic acid or by peptide synthesis. Such modifications include for example deletions from and or insertions into and or substitutions of residues within the amino acid sequences of the antibody. Any combination of deletion insertion and substitution is made to arrive at the final construct provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics. The amino acid alterations may be introduced in the subject antibody amino acid sequence at the time that sequence is made.

A useful method for identification of certain residues or regions of the antibody that are preferred locations for mutagenesis is called alanine scanning mutagenesis as described by Cunningham and Wells 1989 244 1081 1085. Here a residue or group of target residues are identified e.g. charged residues such as arg asp his lys and glu and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino acid most preferably alanine or polyalanine to affect the interaction of the amino acids with antigen. Those amino acid locations demonstrating functional sensitivity to the substitutions then are refined by introducing further or other variants at or for the sites of substitution. Thus while the site for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is predetermined the nature of the mutation per se need not be predetermined. For example to analyze the performance of a mutation at a given site ala scanning or random mutagenesis is conducted at the target codon or region and the expressed immunoglobulins are screened for the desired activity.

Amino acid sequence insertions include amino and or carboxyl terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include an antibody with an N terminal methionyl residue or the antibody fused to a cytotoxic polypeptide. Other insertional variants of the antibody molecule include the fusion to the N or C terminus of the antibody to an enzyme e.g. for ADEPT or a polypeptide which increases the serum half life of the antibody.

Glycosylation of polypeptides is typically either N linked or O linked. N linked refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine X serine and asparagine X threonine where X is any amino acid except proline are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N aceylgalactosamine galactose or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid most commonly serine or threonine although 5 hydroxyproline or 5 hydroxylysine may also be used.

Addition of glycosylation sites to the antibody is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that it contains one or more of the above described tripeptide sequences for N linked glycosylation sites . The alteration may also be made by the addition of or substitution by one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the original antibody for O linked glycosylation sites .

Where the antibody comprises an Fc region the carbohydrate attached thereto may be altered. For example antibodies with a mature carbohydrate structure that lacks fucose attached to an Fc region of the antibody are described in US Pat Appl No US 2003 0157108 Presta L. . See also US 2004 0093621 Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co. Ltd . Antibodies with a bisecting N acetylglucosamine GlcNAc in the carbohydrate attached to an Fc region of the antibody are referenced in WO 2003 011878 Jean Mairet et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 6 602 684 Umana et al. Antibodies with at least one galactose residue in the oligosaccharide attached to an Fc region of the antibody are reported in WO 1997 30087 Patel et al. See also WO 1998 58964 Raju S. and WO 1999 22764 Raju S. concerning antibodies with altered carbohydrate attached to the Fc region thereof. See also US 2005 0123546 Umana et al. on antigen binding molecules with modified glycosylation.

The preferred glycosylation variant herein comprises an Fc region wherein a carbohydrate structure attached to the Fc region lacks fucose. Such variants have improved ADCC function. Optionally the Fc region further comprises one or more amino acid substitutions therein which further improve ADCC for example substitutions at positions 298 333 and or 334 of the Fc region Eu numbering of residues . Examples of publications related to defucosylated or fucose deficient antibodies include US 2003 0157108 WO 2000 61739 WO 2001 29246 US 2003 0115614 US 2002 0164328 US 2004 0093621 US 2004 0132140 US 2004 0110704 US 2004 0110282 US 2004 0109865 WO 2003 085119 WO 2003 084570 WO 2005 035586 WO 2005 035778 WO2005 053742 Okazaki et al. 336 1239 1249 2004 Yamane Ohnuki et al. 87 614 2004 . Examples of cell lines producing defucosylated antibodies include Lec13 CHO cells deficient in protein fucosylation Ripka et al. 249 533 545 1986 US Pat Appl No US 2003 0157108 A1 Presta L and WO 2004 056312 A1 Adams et al. especially at Example 11 and knockout cell lines such as alpha 1 6 fucosyltransferase gene FUT8 knockout CHO cells Yamane Ohnuki et al. 87 614 2004 .

In one aspect the invention provides an antibody fragment comprising at least one characteristic that promotes heterodimerization while minimizing homodimerization of the Fc sequences within the antibody fragment. Such characteristic s improves yield and or purity and or homogeneity of the immunoglobulin populations obtainable by methods of the invention as described herein. In one embodiment a first Fc polypeptide and a second Fc polypeptide meet interact at an interface. In some embodiments wherein the first and second Fc polypeptides meet at an interface the interface of the second Fc polypeptide sequence comprises a protuberance also termed a knob which is positionable in a cavity also termed a hole in the interface of the first Fc polypeptide sequence . In one embodiment the first Fc polypeptide has been altered from a template original polypeptide to encode the cavity or the second Fc polypeptide has been altered from a template original polypeptide to encode the protuberance or both.

In one embodiment the interface of the second Fc polypeptide comprises a protuberance which is positionable in a cavity in the interface of the first Fc polypeptide wherein the cavity or protuberance or both have been introduced into the interface of the first and second Fc polypeptides respectively. In some embodiments wherein the first and second Fc polypeptides meet at an interface the interface of the first Fc polypeptide sequence comprises a protuberance which is positionable in a cavity in the interface of the second Fc polypeptide sequence .

In one embodiment the interface of the first Fc polypeptide comprises a protuberance which is positionable in a cavity in the interface of the second Fc polypeptide wherein the protuberance or cavity or both have been introduced into the interface of the first and second Fc polypeptides respectively.

In one embodiment the protuberance and cavity each comprise a naturally occurring amino acid residue. In one embodiment the Fc polypeptide comprising the protuberance is generated by replacing an original residue from the interface of a template original polypeptide with an import residue having a larger side chain volume than the original residue. In one embodiment the Fc polypeptide comprising the protuberance is generated by a method comprising a step wherein polynucleotide encoding an original residue from the interface of said polypeptide is replaced with polynucleotide encoding an import residue having a larger side chain volume than the original. In one embodiment the original residue is threonine. In one embodiment the original residue is T366. In one embodiment the import residue is arginine R . In one embodiment the import residue is phenylalanine F . In one embodiment the import residue is tyrosine Y . In one embodiment the import residue is tryptophan W . In one embodiment the import residue is R F Y or W. In one embodiment a protuberance is generated by replacing two or more residues in a template original polypeptide. In one embodiment the Fc polypeptide comprising a protuberance comprises replacement of threonine at position 366 with tryptophan amino acid numbering according to the EU numbering scheme of Kabat et al. pp. 688 696 in Sequences of proteins of immunological interest 5th ed. Vol. 1 1991 NIH Bethesda Md. .

In some embodiments the Fc polypeptide comprising a cavity is generated by replacing an original residue in the interface of a template original polypeptide with an import residue having a smaller side chain volume than the original residue. For example the Fc polypeptide comprising the cavity may be generated by a method comprising a step wherein polynucleotide encoding an original residue from the interface of said polypeptide is replaced with polynucleotide encoding an import residue having a smaller side chain volume than the original. In one embodiment the original residue is threonine. In one embodiment the original residue is leucine. In one embodiment the original residue is tyrosine. In one embodiment the import residue is not cysteine C . In one embodiment the import residue is alanine A . In one embodiment the import residue is serine S . In one embodiment the import residue is threonine T . In one embodiment the import residue is valine V . A cavity can be generated by replacing one or more original residues of a template original polypeptide. For example in one embodiment the Fc polypeptide comprising a cavity comprises replacement of two or more original amino acids selected from the group consisting of threonine leucine and tyrosine. In one embodiment the Fc polypeptide comprising a cavity comprises two or more import residues selected from the group consisting of alanine serine threonine and valine. In some embodiments the Fc polypeptide comprising a cavity comprises replacement of two or more original amino acids selected from the group consisting of threonine leucine and tyrosine and wherein said original amino acids are replaced with import residues selected from the group consisting of alanine serine threonine and valine. In some embodiments an original amino acid that is replaced is T366 L368 and or Y407. In one embodiment the Fc polypeptide comprising a cavity comprises replacement of threonine at position 366 with serine amino acid numbering according to the EU numbering scheme of Kabat et al. supra. In one embodiment the Fc polypeptide comprising a cavity comprises replacement of leucine at position 368 with alanine amino acid numbering according to the EU numbering scheme of Kabat et al. supra. In one embodiment the Fc polypeptide comprising a cavity comprises replacement of tyrosine at position 407 with valine amino acid numbering according to the EU numbering scheme of Kabat et al. supra. In one embodiment the Fc polypeptide comprising a cavity comprises two or more amino acid replacements selected from the group consisting of T366S L368A and Y407V amino acid numbering according to the EU numbering scheme of Kabat et al. supra. In some embodiments of these antibody fragments the Fc polypeptide comprising the protuberance comprises replacement of threonine at position 366 with tryptophan amino acid numbering according to the EU numbering scheme of Kabat et al. supra.

In one embodiment the antibody comprises Fc mutations constituting knobs and holes as described in WO2005 063816. For example a hole mutation can be one or more of T366A L368A and or Y407V in an Fc polypeptide and a knob mutation can be T366W.

Another type of variant is an amino acid substitution variant. These variants have at least one amino acid at least two at least three at least 4 or more residue in the antibody molecule replaced by a different residue. The sites of greatest interest for substitutional mutagenesis include the hypervariable regions but FR alterations are also contemplated. Conservative substitutions are shown in Table A under the heading of preferred substitutions. If such substitutions result in a change in biological activity then more substantial changes denominated exemplary substitutions in Table A or as further described below in reference to amino acid classes may be introduced and the products screened.

Substantial modifications in the biological properties of the antibody are accomplished by selecting substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining a the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution for example as a sheet or helical conformation b the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site or c the bulk of the side chain. Naturally occurring residues are divided into groups based on common side chain properties 

Non conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class.

One type of substitutional variant involves substituting one or more hypervariable region residues of a parent antibody e.g. a humanized or human antibody . Generally the resulting variant s selected for further development will have improved biological properties relative to the parent antibody from which they are generated. A convenient way for generating such substitutional variants involves affinity maturation using phage display. Briefly several hypervariable region sites e.g. 6 7 sites are mutated to generate all possible amino acid substitutions at each site. The antibodies thus generated are displayed from filamentous phage particles as fusions to the gene III product of M13 packaged within each particle. The phage displayed variants are then screened for their biological activity e.g. binding affinity as herein disclosed. In order to identify candidate hypervariable region sites for modification alanine scanning mutagenesis can be performed to identify hypervariable region residues contributing significantly to antigen binding. Alternatively or additionally it may be beneficial to analyze a crystal structure of the antigen antibody complex to identify contact points between the antibody and antigen. Such contact residues and neighboring residues are candidates for substitution according to the techniques elaborated herein. Once such variants are generated the panel of variants is subjected to screening as described herein and antibodies with superior properties in one or more relevant assays may be selected for further development.

Nucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence variants of the antibody are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include but are not limited to isolation from a natural source in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants or preparation by oligonucleotide mediated or site directed mutagenesis PCR mutagenesis and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant or a non variant version of the antibody.

It may be desirable to introduce one or more amino acid modifications in an Fc region of the immunoglobulin polypeptides of the invention thereby generating a Fc region variant. The Fc region variant may comprise a human Fc region sequence e.g. a human IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 or IgG4 Fc region comprising an amino acid modification e.g. a substitution at one or more amino acid positions including that of a hinge cysteine.

In accordance with this description and the teachings of the art it is contemplated that in some embodiments an antibody used in methods of the invention may comprise one or more alterations as compared to the wild type counterpart antibody e.g. in the Fc region. These antibodies would nonetheless retain substantially the same characteristics required for therapeutic utility as compared to their wild type counterpart. For example it is thought that certain alterations can be made in the Fc region that would result in altered i.e. either improved or diminished C1q binding and or Complement Dependent Cytotoxicity CDC e.g. as described in WO99 51642. See also Duncan Winter 322 738 40 1988 U.S. Pat. No. 5 648 260 U.S. Pat. No. 5 624 821 and WO94 29351 concerning other examples of Fc region variants.

The antibodies of the present invention can be further modified to contain additional nonproteinaceous moieties that are known in the art and readily available. Preferably the moieties suitable for derivatization of the antibody are water soluble polymers. Non limiting examples of water soluble polymers include but are not limited to polyethylene glycol PEG copolymers of ethylene glycol propylene glycol carboxymethylcellulose dextran polyvinyl alcohol polyvinyl pyrrolidone poly 1 3 dioxolane poly 1 3 6 trioxane ethylene maleic anhydride copolymer polyaminoacids either homopolymers or random copolymers and dextran or poly n vinyl pyrrolidone polyethylene glycol propropylene glycol homopolymers prolypropylene oxide ethylene oxide co polymers polyoxyethylated polyols e.g. glycerol polyvinyl alcohol and mixtures thereof. Polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde may have advantages in manufacturing due to its stability in water. The polymer may be of any molecular weight and may be branched or unbranched. The number of polymers attached to the antibody may vary and if more than one polymers are attached they can be the same or different molecules. In general the number and or type of polymers used for derivatization can be determined based on considerations including but not limited to the particular properties or functions of the antibody to be improved whether the antibody derivative will be used in a therapy under defined conditions etc.

The antibodies of the present invention can be characterized for their physical chemical properties and biological functions by various assays known in the art some of which are disclosed herein . For example the antibodies can be further characterized by a series of assays including but not limited to N terminal sequencing amino acid analysis non denaturing size exclusion high pressure liquid chromatography HPLC mass spectrometry ion exchange chromatography and papain digestion.

In certain embodiments of the invention the antibodies produced herein are analyzed for their biological activity. In some embodiments the antibodies of the present invention are tested for their antigen binding activity. The antigen binding assays that are known in the art and can be used herein include without limitation any direct or competitive binding assays using techniques such as western blots radioimmunoassays ELISA enzyme linked immunosorbent assay sandwich immunoassays immunoprecipitation assays fluorescent immunoassays and protein A immunoassays. Illustrative assays are provided below in the Examples section.

For recombinant production of a heterologous polypeptide e.g an antibody the nucleic acid encoding it is isolated and inserted into a replicable vector for further cloning amplification of the DNA or for expression. DNA encoding the polypeptide eg antibody is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures e.g. by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibody . Many vectors are available. The choice of vector depends in part on the host cell to be used. Generally preferred host cells are of either prokaryotic origin. It will be appreciated that constant regions of any isotype can be used for this purpose including IgG IgM IgA IgD and IgE constant regions and that such constant regions can be obtained from any human or animal species.

Polynucleotide sequences encoding polypeptide components of the polypeptide e.g. antibody of the invention can be obtained using standard recombinant techniques. Desired polynucleotide sequences may be isolated and sequenced from antibody producing cells such as hybridoma cells. Alternatively polynucleotides can be synthesized using nucleotide synthesizer or PCR techniques. Once obtained sequences encoding the polypeptides are inserted into a recombinant vector capable of replicating and expressing heterologous polynucleotides in prokaryotic hosts. Many vectors that are available and known in the art can be used for the purpose of the present invention. Selection of an appropriate vector will depend mainly on the size of the nucleic acids to be inserted into the vector and the particular host cell to be transformed with the vector. Each vector contains various components depending on its function amplification or expression of heterologous polynucleotide or both and its compatibility with the particular host cell in which it resides. The vector components generally include but are not limited to an origin of replication a selection marker gene a promoter a ribosome binding site RBS a signal sequence the heterologous nucleic acid insert and a transcription termination sequence.

In general plasmid vectors containing replicon and control sequences which are derived from species compatible with the host cell are used in connection with these hosts. The vector ordinarily carries a replication site as well as marking sequences which are capable of providing phenotypic selection in transformed cells. For example E. coli is typically transformed using pBR322 a plasmid derived from an species. pBR322 contains genes encoding ampicillin Amp and tetracycline Tet resistance and thus provides easy means for identifying transformed cells. pBR322 its derivatives or other microbial plasmids or bacteriophage may also contain or be modified to contain promoters which can be used by the microbial organism for expression of endogenous proteins. Examples of pBR322 derivatives used for expression of particular antibodies are described in detail in Carter et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 648 237.

In addition phage vectors containing replicon and control sequences that are compatible with the host microorganism can be used as transforming vectors in connection with these hosts. For example bacteriophage such as GEM 11 may be utilized in making a recombinant vector which can be used to transform susceptible host cells such as LE392.

The expression vector of the invention may comprise two or more promoter cistron pairs encoding each of the polypeptide components. A promoter is an untranslated regulatory sequence located upstream 5 to a cistron that modulates its expression. Prokaryotic promoters typically fall into two classes inducible and constitutive. Inducible promoter is a promoter that initiates increased levels of transcription of the cistron under its control in response to changes in the culture condition e.g. the presence or absence of a nutrient or a change in temperature.

A large number of promoters recognized by a variety of potential host cells are well known. The selected promoter can be operably linked to cistron DNA encoding the light or heavy chain by removing the promoter from the source DNA via restriction enzyme digestion and inserting the isolated promoter sequence into the vector of the invention. Both the native promoter sequence and many heterologous promoters may be used to direct amplification and or expression of the target genes. In some embodiments heterologous promoters are utilized as they generally permit greater transcription and higher yields of expressed target gene as compared to the native target polypeptide promoter.

Promoters suitable for use with prokaryotic hosts include the PhoA promoter the lactamase and lactose promoter systems a tryptophan trp promoter system and hybrid promoters such as the tac or the trc promoter. However other promoters that are functional in bacteria such as other known bacterial or phage promoters are suitable as well. Their nucleotide sequences have been published thereby enabling a skilled worker operably to ligate them to cistrons encoding the target light and heavy chains Siebenlist et al. 1980 Cell 20 269 using linkers or adaptors to supply any required restriction sites.

In one aspect of the invention each cistron within the recombinant vector comprises a secretion signal sequence component that directs translocation of the expressed polypeptides across a membrane. In general the signal sequence may be a component of the vector or it may be a part of the target polypeptide DNA that is inserted into the vector. The signal sequence selected for the purpose of this invention should be one that is recognized and processed i.e. cleaved by a signal peptidase by the host cell. For prokaryotic host cells that do not recognize and process the signal sequences native to the heterologous polypeptides the signal sequence is substituted by a prokaryotic signal sequence selected for example from the signal polypeptides of the present invention. In addition the vector may comprise a signal sequence selected from the group consisting of the alkaline phosphatase penicillinase Lpp or heat stable enterotoxin II STII leaders LamB PhoE PelB OmpA and MBP.

In one aspect of the invention one or more polynucleotides e.g. expression vectors collectively encode a one armed antibody. In one embodiment a single polynucleotide encodes a the light and heavy chain components of the one armed antibody and b the Fc polypeptide. In one embodiment a single polynucleotide encodes the light and heavy chain components of the one armed antibody and a separate polynucleotide encodes the Fc polypeptide. In one embodiment separate polynucleotides encode the light chain component of the one armed antibody the heavy chain component of the one armed antibody and the Fc polypeptide respectively. Production of a one armed antibody is described in for example in WO2005063816.

Prokaryotic host cells suitable for expressing antibodies of the invention include Archaebacteria and Eubacteria such as Gram negative or Gram positive organisms. Examples of useful bacteria include e.g. Bacilli e.g. Enterobacteria species e.g. or . In one embodiment gram negative cells are used. In one embodiment cells are used as hosts for the invention. Examples of strains include strain W3110 Bachmann 2 Washington D.C. American Society for Microbiology 1987 pp. 1190 1219 ATCC Deposit No. 27 325 and derivatives thereof including strain 33D3 having genotype W3110 fhuA tonA ptr3 lac Iq lacL8 ompT nmpc fepE degP41 kanR U.S. Pat. No. 5 639 635 and strains 63C1 and 64B4. Other strains and derivatives thereof such as 294 ATCC 31 446 B 1776 ATCC 31 537 and RV308 ATCC 31 608 are also suitable. These examples are illustrative rather than limiting. Methods for constructing derivatives of any of the above mentioned bacteria having defined genotypes are known in the art and described in for example Bass et al. Proteins 8 309 314 1990 . It is generally necessary to select the appropriate bacteria taking into consideration replicability of the replicon in the cells of a bacterium. For example or species can be suitably used as the host when well known plasmids such as pBR322 pBR325 pACYC177 or pKN410 are used to supply the replicon. Typically the host cell should secrete minimal amounts of proteolytic enzymes and additional protease inhibitors may desirably be incorporated in the cell culture.

Host cells are transformed with the above described expression vectors and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters selecting transformants or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.

Transformation means introducing DNA into the prokaryotic host so that the DNA is replicable either as an extrachromosomal element or by chromosomal integrant. Depending on the host cell used transformation is done using standard techniques appropriate to such cells. The calcium treatment employing calcium chloride is generally used for bacterial cells that contain substantial cell wall barriers. Another method for transformation employs polyethylene glycol DMSO. Yet another technique used is electroporation.

Prokaryotic cells used to produce the polypeptides of the invention are grown in media known in the art and suitable for culture of the selected host cells. Examples of suitable media include Luria broth LB plus necessary nutrient supplements. In some embodiments the media also contains a selection agent chosen based on the construction of the expression vector to selectively permit growth of prokaryotic cells containing the expression vector. For example ampicillin is added to media for growth of cells expressing ampicillin resistant gene.

Any necessary supplements besides carbon nitrogen and inorganic phosphate sources may also be included at appropriate concentrations introduced alone or as a mixture with another supplement or medium such as a complex nitrogen source. Optionally the culture medium may contain one or more reducing agents selected from the group consisting of glutathione cysteine cystamine thioglycollate dithioerythritol and dithiothreitol.

The prokaryotic host cells are cultured at suitable temperatures. For growth for example the preferred temperature ranges from about 20 C. to about 39 C. more preferably from about 25 C. to about 37 C. even more preferably at about 30 C. The pH of the medium may be any pH ranging from about 5 to about 9 depending mainly on the host organism. For the pH is preferably from about 6.8 to about 7.4 and more preferably about 7.0.

If an inducible promoter is used in the expression vector of the invention protein expression is induced under conditions suitable for the activation of the promoter. In one aspect of the invention PhoA promoters are used for controlling transcription of the polypeptides. Accordingly the transformed host cells are cultured in a phosphate limiting medium for induction. Preferably the phosphate limiting medium is the C.R.A.P medium see e.g. Simmons et al. J. Immunol. Methods 2002 263 133 147 or media described in WO2002 061090. A variety of other inducers may be used according to the vector construct employed as is known in the art.

In one embodiment the expressed polypeptides of the present invention are secreted into and recovered from the periplasm of the host cells. Protein recovery typically involves disrupting the microorganism generally by such means as osmotic shock sonication or lysis. Once cells are disrupted cell debris or whole cells may be removed by centrifugation or filtration. The proteins may be further purified for example by affinity resin chromatography. Alternatively proteins can be transported into the culture media and isolated therein. Cells may be removed from the culture and the culture supernatant being filtered and concentrated for further purification of the proteins produced. The expressed polypeptides can be further isolated and identified using commonly known methods such as polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis PAGE and Western blot assay.

In one aspect of the invention antibody production is conducted in large quantity by a fermentation process. Various large scale fed batch fermentation procedures are available for production of recombinant proteins. Large scale fermentations have at least 1000 liters of capacity preferably about 1 000 to 100 000 liters of capacity. These fermentors use agitator impellers to distribute oxygen and nutrients especially glucose the preferred carbon energy source . Small scale fermentation refers generally to fermentation in a fermentor that is no more than approximately 100 liters in volumetric capacity and can range from about 1 liter to about 100 liters.

In a fermentation process induction of protein expression is typically initiated after the cells have been grown under suitable conditions to a desired density e.g. an OD550 of about 180 220 at which stage the cells are in the early stationary phase. A variety of inducers may be used according to the vector construct employed as is known in the art and described above. Cells may be grown for shorter periods prior to induction. Cells are usually induced for about 12 50 hours although longer or shorter induction time may be used.

To improve the production yield and quality of the polypeptides of the invention various fermentation conditions can be modified. For example to improve the proper assembly and folding of the secreted antibody polypeptides additional vectors overexpressing chaperone proteins such as Dsb proteins DsbA DsbB DsbC DsbD and or DsbG or FkpA a peptidylprolyl cis trans isomerase with chaperone activity can be used to co transform the host prokaryotic cells. The chaperone proteins have been demonstrated to facilitate the proper folding and solubility of heterologous proteins produced in bacterial host cells. Chen et al. 1999 J. Biol. Chem. 274 19601 19605 Georgiou et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 083 715 Georgiou et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 027 888 Bothmann and Pluckthun 2000 J. Biol. Chem. 275 17100 17105 Ramm and Pluckthun 2000 J. Biol. Chem. 275 17106 17113 Arie et al. 2001 Mol. Microbiol. 39 199 210. In some embodiments DsbA and C are expressed in the bacterial host cell.

To minimize proteolysis of expressed heterologous proteins especially those that are proteolytically sensitive certain host strains deficient for proteolytic enzymes can be used for the present invention. For example host cell strains may be modified to effect genetic mutation s in the genes encoding known bacterial proteases such as Protease III OmpT DegP Tsp Protease I Protease Mi Protease V Protease VI and combinations thereof. Some protease deficient strains are available and described in for example Joly et al. 1998 supra Georgiou et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 264 365 Georgiou et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 508 192 Hara et al. Microbial Drug Resistance 2 63 72 1996 .

In one embodiment strains deficient for proteolytic enzymes and transformed with plasmids overexpressing one or more chaperone proteins are used as host cells in the expression system of the invention.

Standard protein purification methods known in the art can be employed. The following procedures are exemplary of suitable purification procedures fractionation on immunoaffinity or ion exchange columns ethanol precipitation reverse phase HPLC chromatography on silica or on a cation exchange resin such as DEAE chromatofocusing SDS PAGE ammonium sulfate precipitation and gel filtration using for example Sephadex G 75.

In one aspect Protein A immobilized on a solid phase is used for immunoaffinity purification of the antibody products of the invention. Protein A is a 41kD cell wall protein from which binds with a high affinity to the Fc region of antibodies. Lindmark et al. 1983 J. Immunol. Meth. 62 1 13. The solid phase to which Protein A is immobilized is preferably a column comprising a glass or silica surface more preferably a controlled pore glass column or a silicic acid column. In some applications the column has been coated with a reagent such as glycerol in an attempt to prevent nonspecific adherence of contaminants.

As the first step of purification the preparation derived from the cell culture as described above is applied onto the Protein A immobilized solid phase to allow specific binding of the antibody of interest to Protein A. The solid phase is then washed to remove contaminants non specifically bound to the solid phase. Finally the antibody of interest is recovered from the solid phase by elution.

The invention also provides immunoconjugates interchangeably termed antibody drug conjugates or ADC comprising any of the antibodies described herein conjugated to a cytotoxic agent such as a chemotherapeutic agent a drug a growth inhibitory agent a toxin e.g. an enzymatically active toxin of bacterial fungal plant or animal origin or fragments thereof or a radioactive isotope i.e. a radioconjugate .

The use of antibody drug conjugates for the local delivery of cytotoxic or cytostatic agents i.e. drugs to kill or inhibit tumor cells in the treatment of cancer Syrigos and Epenetos 1999 Anticancer Research 19 605 614 Niculescu Duvaz and Springer 1997 Adv. Drg. Del. Rev. 26 151 172 U.S. Pat. No. 4 975 278 allows targeted delivery of the drug moiety to tumors and intracellular accumulation therein where systemic administration of these unconjugated drug agents may result in unacceptable levels of toxicity to normal cells as well as the tumor cells sought to be eliminated Baldwin et al. 1986 Lancet pp. Mar. 15 1986 603 05 Thorpe 1985 Antibody Carriers Of Cytotoxic Agents In Cancer Therapy A Review in Monoclonal Antibodies 84 Biological And Clinical Applications A. Pinchera et al. ed.s pp. 475 506 . Maximal efficacy with minimal toxicity is sought thereby. Both polyclonal antibodies and monoclonal antibodies have been reported as useful in these strategies Rowland et al. 1986 Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 21 183 87 . Drugs used in these methods include daunomycin doxorubicin methotrexate and vindesine Rowland et al. 1986 supra . Toxins used in antibody toxin conjugates include bacterial toxins such as diphtheria toxin plant toxins such as ricin small molecule toxins such as geldanamycin Mandler et al 2000 Jour. of the Nat. Cancer Inst. 92 19 1573 1581 Mandler et al. 2000 Bioorganic Med. Chem. Letters 10 1025 1028 Mandler et al. 2002 Bioconjugate Chem. 13 786 791 maytansinoids EP 1391213 Liu et al. 1996 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93 8618 8623 and calicheamicin Lode et al. 1998 Cancer Res. 58 2928 Hinman et al. 1993 Cancer Res. 53 3336 3342 . The toxins may effect their cytotoxic and cytostatic effects by mechanisms including tubulin binding DNA binding or topoisomerase inhibition. Some cytotoxic drugs tend to be inactive or less active when conjugated to large antibodies or protein receptor ligands.

Chemotherapeutic agents useful in the generation of immunoconjugates are described herein e.g. above . Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof that can be used include diphtheria A chain nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin exotoxin A chain from ricin A chain abrin A chain modeccin A chain alpha sarcin proteins dianthin proteins proteins PAPI PAPII and PAP S inhibitor curcin crotin sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor gelonin mitogellin restrictocin phenomycin enomycin and the tricothecenes.

For example a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al. Science 238 1098 1987 . Carbon 14 labeled 1 isothiocyanatobenzyl 3 methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid MX DTPA is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94 11026.

Conjugates of an antibody and one or more small molecule toxins such as a calicheamicin maytansinoids dolastatins aurostatins a trichothecene and CC1065 and the derivatives of these toxins that have toxin activity are also contemplated herein.

In some embodiments the immunoconjugate comprises an antibody full length or fragments of the invention conjugated to one or more maytansinoid molecules.

Maytansinoids are mitototic inhibitors which act by inhibiting tubulin polymerization. Maytansine was first isolated from the east African shrub U.S. Pat. No. 3 896 111 . Subsequently it was discovered that certain microbes also produce maytansinoids such as maytansinol and C 3 maytansinol esters U.S. Pat. No. 4 151 042 . Synthetic maytansinol and derivatives and analogues thereof are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 137 230 4 248 870 4 256 746 4 260 608 4 265 814 4 294 757 4 307 016 4 308 268 4 308 269 4 309 428 4 313 946 4 315 929 4 317 821 4 322 348 4 331 598 4 361 650 4 364 866 4 424 219 4 450 254 4 362 663 and 4 371 533.

Maytansinoid drug moieties are attractive drug moieties in antibody drug conjugates because they are i relatively accessible to prepare by fermentation or chemical modification derivatization of fermentation products ii amenable to derivatization with functional groups suitable for conjugation through the non disulfide linkers to antibodies iii stable in plasma and iv effective against a variety of tumor cell lines.

Immunoconjugates containing maytansinoids methods of making same and their therapeutic use are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 208 020 5 416 064 and European Patent EP 0 425 235 B1 the disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. Liu et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93 8618 8623 1996 described immunoconjugates comprising a maytansinoid designated DM1 linked to the monoclonal antibody C242 directed against human colorectal cancer. The conjugate was found to be highly cytotoxic towards cultured colon cancer cells and showed antitumor activity in an in vivo tumor growth assay. Chari et al. Cancer Research 52 127 131 1992 describe immunoconjugates in which a maytansinoid was conjugated via a disulfide linker to the murine antibody A7 binding to an antigen on human colon cancer cell lines or to another murine monoclonal antibody TA.1 that binds the HER 2 neu oncogene. The cytotoxicity of the TA.1 maytansinoid conjugate was tested in vitro on the human breast cancer cell line SK BR 3 which expresses 3 10HER 2 surface antigens per cell. The drug conjugate achieved a degree of cytotoxicity similar to the free maytansinoid drug which could be increased by increasing the number of maytansinoid molecules per antibody molecule. The A7 maytansinoid conjugate showed low systemic cytotoxicity in mice.

Antibody maytansinoid conjugates are prepared by chemically linking an antibody to a maytansinoid molecule without significantly diminishing the biological activity of either the antibody or the maytansinoid molecule. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 the disclosure of which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference . An average of 3 4 maytansinoid molecules conjugated per antibody molecule has shown efficacy in enhancing cytotoxicity of target cells without negatively affecting the function or solubility of the antibody although even one molecule of toxin antibody would be expected to enhance cytotoxicity over the use of naked antibody. Maytansinoids are well known in the art and can be synthesized by known techniques or isolated from natural sources. Suitable maytansinoids are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 and in the other patents and nonpatent publications referred to hereinabove. Preferred maytansinoids are maytansinol and maytansinol analogues modified in the aromatic ring or at other positions of the maytansinol molecule such as various maytansinol esters.

There are many linking groups known in the art for making antibody maytansinoid conjugates including for example those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 or EP Patent 0 425 235 B1 Chari et al. Cancer Research 52 127 131 1992 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 960 602 filed Oct. 8 2004 the disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. Antibody maytansinoid conjugates comprising the linker component SMCC may be prepared as disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 960 602 filed Oct. 8 2004. The linking groups include disulfide groups thioether groups acid labile groups photolabile groups peptidase labile groups or esterase labile groups as disclosed in the above identified patents disulfide and thioether groups being preferred. Additional linking groups are described and exemplified herein.

Conjugates of the antibody and maytansinoid may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate SMCC iminothiolane IT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutaraldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bis p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as toluene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene . Particularly preferred coupling agents include N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP Carlsson et al. Biochem. J. 173 723 737 1978 and N succinimidyl 4 2 pyridylthio pentanoate SPP to provide for a disulfide linkage.

The linker may be attached to the maytansinoid molecule at various positions depending on the type of the link. For example an ester linkage may be formed by reaction with a hydroxyl group using conventional coupling techniques. The reaction may occur at the C 3 position having a hydroxyl group the C 14 position modified with hydroxymethyl the C 15 position modified with a hydroxyl group and the C 20 position having a hydroxyl group. In a preferred embodiment the linkage is formed at the C 3 position of maytansinol or a maytansinol analogue.

In some embodiments the immunoconjugate comprises an antibody of the invention conjugated to dolastatins or dolostatin peptidic analogs and derivatives the auristatins U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 635 483 and 5 780 588 . Dolastatins and auristatins have been shown to interfere with microtubule dynamics GTP hydrolysis and nuclear and cellular division Woyke et al 2001 Antimicrob. Agents and Chemother. 45 12 3580 3584 and have anticancer U.S. Pat. No. 5 663 149 and antifungal activity Pettit et al. 1998 Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 42 2961 2965 .

Typically peptide based drug moieties can be prepared by forming a peptide bond between two or more amino acids and or peptide fragments. Such peptide bonds can be prepared for example according to the liquid phase synthesis method see E. Schroder and K. Liibke The Peptides volume 1 pp. 76 136 1965 Academic Press that is well known in the field of peptide chemistry. The auristatin dolastatin drug moieties may be prepared according to the methods of U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 635 483 and 5 780 588 Pettit et al. 1989 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 111 5463 5465 Pettit et al. 1998 Anti Cancer Drug Design 13 243 277 Pettit G. R. et al. Synthesis 1996 719 725 and Pettit et al. 1996 J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1 5 859 863.

In other embodiments the immunoconjugate comprises an antibody of the invention conjugated to one or more calicheamicin molecules. The calicheamicin family of antibiotics are capable of producing double stranded DNA breaks at sub picomolar concentrations. For the preparation of conjugates of the calicheamicin family see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 712 374 5 714 586 5 739 116 5 767 285 5 770 701 5 770 710 5 773 001 and 5 877 296 all to American Cyanamid Company . Structural analogues of calicheamicin which may be used include but are not limited to N acetyl PSAG and Hinman et al. Cancer Research 53 3336 3342 1993 Lode et al. Cancer Research 58 2925 2928 1998 and the aforementioned U.S. patents to American Cyanamid . Another anti tumor drug that the antibody can be conjugated is QFA which is an antifolate. Both calicheamicin and QFA have intracellular sites of action and do not readily cross the plasma membrane. Therefore cellular uptake of these agents through antibody mediated internalization greatly enhances their cytotoxic effects.

Other antitumor agents that can be conjugated to the antibodies of the invention include BCNU streptozoicin vincristine and 5 fluorouracil the family of agents known collectively LL E33288 complex described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 053 394 and 5 770 710 as well as esperamicins U.S. Pat. No. 5 877 296 .

Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof which can be used include diphtheria A chain nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin exotoxin A chain from ricin A chain abrin A chain modeccin A chain alpha sarcin Aleurites fordii proteins dianthin proteins proteins PAPI PAPII and PAP S inhibitor curcin crotin sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor gelonin mitogellin restrictocin phenomycin enomycin and the tricothecenes. See for example WO 93 21232 published Oct. 28 1993.

The present invention further contemplates an immunoconjugate formed between an antibody and a compound with nucleolytic activity e.g. a ribonuclease or a DNA endonuclease such as a deoxyribonuclease DNase .

For selective destruction of the tumor the antibody may comprise a highly radioactive atom. A variety of radioactive isotopes are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Examples include At I I Y Re Re Sm Bi P Pband radioactive isotopes of Lu. When the conjugate is used for detection it may comprise a radioactive atom for scintigraphic studies for example tcor I or a spin label for nuclear magnetic resonance NMR imaging also known as magnetic resonance imaging mri such as iodine 123 again iodine 131 indium 111 fluorine 19 carbon 13 nitrogen 15 oxygen 17 gadolinium manganese or iron.

The radio or other labels may be incorporated in the conjugate in known ways. For example the peptide may be biosynthesized or may be synthesized by chemical amino acid synthesis using suitable amino acid precursors involving for example fluorine 19 in place of hydrogen. Labels such as tcor I Re Reand Incan be attached via a cysteine residue in the peptide. Yttrium 90 can be attached via a lysine residue. The IODOGEN method Fraker et al 1978 Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 80 49 57 can be used to incorporate iodine 123. Monoclonal Antibodies in Immunoscintigraphy Chatal CRC Press 1989 describes other methods in detail.

Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate SMCC iminothiolane IT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutaraldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bis p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as toluene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene . For example a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al. Science 238 1098 1987 . Carbon 14 labeled 1 isothiocyanatobenzyl 3 methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid MX DTPA is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94 11026. The linker may be a cleavable linker facilitating release of the cytotoxic drug in the cell. For example an acid labile linker peptidase sensitive linker photolabile linker dimethyl linker or disulfide containing linker Chari et al. Cancer Research 52 127 131 1992 U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 may be used.

The compounds of the invention expressly contemplate but are not limited to ADC prepared with cross linker reagents BMPS EMCS GMBS HBVS LC SMCC MBS MPBH SBAP SIA SIAB SMCC SMPB SMPH sulfo EMCS sulfo GMBS sulfo KMUS sulfo MBS sulfo SIAB sulfo SMCC and sulfo SMPB and SVSB succinimidyl 4 vinylsulfone benzoate which are commercially available e.g. from Pierce Biotechnology Inc. Rockford Ill. U.S.A . See pages 467 498 2003 2004 Applications Handbook and Catalog.

In the antibody drug conjugates ADC of the invention an antibody Ab is conjugated to one or more drug moieties D e.g. about 1 to about 20 drug moieties per antibody through a linker L . The ADC of Formula I may be prepared by several routes employing organic chemistry reactions conditions and reagents known to those skilled in the art including 1 reaction of a nucleophilic group of an antibody with a bivalent linker reagent to form Ab L via a covalent bond followed by reaction with a drug moiety D and 2 reaction of a nucleophilic group of a drug moiety with a bivalent linker reagent to form D L via a covalent bond followed by reaction with the nucleophilic group of an antibody. Additional methods for preparing ADC are described herein. Ab L D I

The linker may be composed of one or more linker components. Exemplary linker components include 6 maleimidocaproyl MC maleimidopropanoyl MP valine citrulline val cit alanine phenylalanine ala phe p aminobenzyloxycarbonyl PAB N Succinimidyl 4 2 pyridylthio pentanoate SPP N Succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate SMCC and N Succinimidyl 4 iodo acetyl aminobenzoate SIAB . Additional linker components are known in the art and some are described herein. See also Monomethylvaline Compounds Capable of Conjugation to Ligands U.S. Ser. No. 10 983 340 filed Nov. 5 2004 the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

In some embodiments the linker may comprise amino acid residues. Exemplary amino acid linker components include a dipeptide a tripeptide a tetrapeptide or a pentapeptide. Exemplary dipeptides include valine citrulline vc or val cit alanine phenylalanine af or ala phe . Exemplary tripeptides include glycine valine citrulline gly val cit and glycine glycine glycine gly gly gly . Amino acid residues which comprise an amino acid linker component include those occurring naturally as well as minor amino acids and non naturally occurring amino acid analogs such as citrulline. Amino acid linker components can be designed and optimized in their selectivity for enzymatic cleavage by a particular enzymes for example a tumor associated protease catantigen B C and D or a plasmin protease.

Nucleophilic groups on antibodies include but are not limited to i N terminal amine groups ii side chain amine groups e.g. lysine iii side chain thiol groups e.g. cysteine and iv sugar hydroxyl or amino groups where the antibody is glycosylated. Amine thiol and hydroxyl groups are nucleophilic and capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including i active esters such as NHS esters HOBt esters haloformates and acid halides ii alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides iii aldehydes ketones carboxyl and maleimide groups. Certain antibodies have reducible interchain disulfides i.e. cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT dithiothreitol . Each cysteine bridge will thus form theoretically two reactive thiol nucleophiles. Additional nucleophilic groups can be introduced into antibodies through the reaction of lysines with 2 iminothiolane Traut s reagent resulting in conversion of an amine into a thiol. Reactive thiol groups may be introduced into the antibody by introducing one two three four or more cysteine residues e.g. preparing mutant antibodies comprising one or more non native cysteine amino acid residues .

Antibody drug conjugates of the invention may also be produced by modification of the antibody to introduce electrophilic moieties which can react with nucleophilic substituents on the linker reagent or drug. The sugars of glycosylated antibodies may be oxidized e.g. with periodate oxidizing reagents to form aldehyde or ketone groups which may react with the amine group of linker reagents or drug moieties. The resulting imine Schiff base groups may form a stable linkage or may be reduced e.g. by borohydride reagents to form stable amine linkages. In one embodiment reaction of the carbohydrate portion of a glycosylated antibody with either glactose oxidase or sodium meta periodate may yield carbonyl aldehyde and ketone groups in the protein that can react with appropriate groups on the drug Hermanson Bioconjugate Techniques . In another embodiment proteins containing N terminal serine or threonine residues can react with sodium meta periodate resulting in production of an aldehyde in place of the first amino acid Geoghegan Stroh 1992 Bioconjugate Chem. 3 138 146 U.S. Pat. No. 5 362 852 . Such aldehyde can be reacted with a drug moiety or linker nucleophile.

Likewise nucleophilic groups on a drug moiety include but are not limited to amine thiol hydroxyl hydrazide oxime hydrazine thiosemicarbazone hydrazine carboxylate and arylhydrazide groups capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including i active esters such as NHS esters HOBt esters haloformates and acid halides ii alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides iii aldehydes ketones carboxyl and maleimide groups.

Alternatively a fusion protein comprising the antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made e.g. by recombinant techniques or peptide synthesis. The length of DNA may comprise respective regions encoding the two portions of the conjugate either adjacent one another or separated by a region encoding a linker peptide which does not destroy the desired properties of the conjugate.

In yet another embodiment the antibody may be conjugated to a receptor such streptavidin for utilization in tumor pre targeting wherein the antibody receptor conjugate is administered to the individual followed by removal of unbound conjugate from the circulation using a clearing agent and then administration of a ligand e.g. avidin which is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent e.g. a radionucleotide .

Therapeutic formulations of the heterologous polypeptide are prepared for storage by mixing the heterologous polypeptide having the desired degree of purity with optional physiologically acceptable carriers excipients or stabilizers 16th edition Osol A. Ed. 1980 in the form of aqueous solutions lyophilized or other dried formulations. Acceptable carriers excipients or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed and include buffers such as phosphate citrate histidine and other organic acids antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine preservatives such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride hexamethonium chloride benzalkonium chloride benzethonium chloride phenol butyl or benzyl alcohol alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben catechol resorcinol cyclohexanol 3 pentanol and m cresol low molecular weight less than about 10 residues polypeptides proteins such as serum albumin gelatin or immunoglobulins hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone amino acids such as glycine glutamine asparagine histidine arginine or lysine monosaccharides disaccharides and other carbohydrates including glucose mannose or dextrins chelating agents such as EDTA sugars such as sucrose mannitol trehalose or sorbitol salt forming counter ions such as sodium metal complexes e.g. Zn protein complexes and or non ionic surfactants such as TWEEN PLURONICS or polyethylene glycol PEG .

The formulation herein may also contain more than one active compound as necessary for the particular indication being treated preferably those with complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended.

The active ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsule prepared for example by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization for example hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin microcapsule and poly methylmethacylate microcapsule respectively in colloidal drug delivery systems for example liposomes albumin microspheres microemulsions nano particles and nanocapsules or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in 16th edition Osol A. Ed. 1980 .

The formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.

Sustained release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the antibody which matrices are in the form of shaped articles e.g. films or microcapsule. Examples of sustained release matrices include polyesters hydrogels for example poly 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate or poly vinylalcohol polylactides U.S. Pat. No. 3 773 919 copolymers of L glutamic acid and ethyl L glutamate non degradable ethylene vinyl acetate degradable lactic acid glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate and poly D 3 hydroxybutyric acid. While polymers such as ethylene vinyl acetate and lactic acid glycolic acid enable release of molecules for over 100 days certain hydrogels release proteins for shorter time periods. When encapsulated antibodies remain in the body for a long time they may denature or aggregate as a result of exposure to moisture at 37 C. resulting in a loss of biological activity and possible changes in immunogenicity. Rational strategies can be devised for stabilization depending on the mechanism involved. For example if the aggregation mechanism is discovered to be intermolecular S S bond formation through thio disulfide interchange stabilization may be achieved by modifying sulfhydryl residues lyophilizing from acidic solutions controlling moisture content using appropriate additives and developing specific polymer matrix compositions.

A heterologous polypeptide of the present invention may be used for example to purify detect and target a specific polypeptide it recognizes including both in vitro and in vivo diagnostic and therapeutic methods.

In one aspect an antibody of the invention can be used in immunoassays for qualitatively and quantitatively measuring specific antigens in biological samples. Conventional methods for detecting antigen antibody binding includes for example an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA an radioimmunoassay RIA or tissue immunohistochemistry. Many methods may use a label bound to the antibody for detection purposes. The label used with the antibody is any detectable functionality that does not interfere with its binding to antibody. Numerous labels are known including the radioisotopes P S C I H and I fluorophores such as rare earth chelates or fluorescein and its derivatives rhodamine and its derivatives dansyl umbelliferone luceriferases e.g. firefly luciferase and bacterial luciferase U.S. Pat. No. 4 737 456 luciferin 2 3 dihydrophthalazinediones horseradish peroxidase HRP alkaline phosphatase .beta. galactosidase glucoamylase lysozyme saccharide oxidases e.g. glucose oxidase galactose oxidase and glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase heterocyclic oxidases such as uricase and xanthine oxidase lactoperoxidase biotin avidin spin labels bacteriophage labels stable free radicals imaging radionuclides such as Technecium and the like.

Conventional methods are available to bind these labels covalently to the heterologous polypeptides. For instance coupling agents such as dialdehydes carbodiimides dimaleimides bis imidates bis diazotized benzidine and the like may be used to tag the antibodies with the above described fluorescent chemiluminescent and enzyme labels. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 3 940 475 fluorimetry and U.S. Pat. No. 3 645 090 enzymes Hunter et al. 144 945 1962 David et al. 13 1014 1021 1974 Pain et al. 40 219 230 1981 and Nygren 30 407 412 1982 . Preferred labels herein are enzymes such as horseradish peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase. The conjugation of such label including the enzymes to the antibody polypeptide is a standard manipulative procedure for one of ordinary skill in immunoassay techniques. See for example O Sullivan et al. Methods for the Preparation of Enzyme antibody Conjugates for Use in Enzyme Immunoassay in Methods in Enzymology ed. J. J. Langone and H. Van Vunakis Vol. 73 Academic Press New York N.Y. 1981 pp. 147 166. Such bonding methods are suitable for use with the heterologous polypeptides of this invention.

Alternative to labeling the heterologous polypeptide antigen can be assayed in biological fluids by a competition immunoassay utilizing a competing antigen standard labeled with a detectable substance and an unlabeled heterologous polypeptide. In this assay the biological sample the labeled antigen standards and the heterologous polypeptide are combined and the amount of labeled antigen standard bound to the unlabeled heterologous polypeptide is determined. The amount of tested antigen in the biological sample is inversely proportional to the amount of labeled antigen standard bound to the heterologous polypeptide.

In one aspect a heterologous polypeptide such as an antibody of the invention is particularly useful to detect and profile expressions of specific surface antigens in vitro or in vivo. As discussed before generally an aglycosylated antibody does not exert effector functions i.e. ADCC or CDC activity . Therefore when the antibody binds to the cell surface antigen it will not initiate undesirable cytotoxic events. The surface antigen can be specific to a particular cell or tissue type therefore serving as a marker of the cell or tissue type. Preferably the surface antigen marker is differentially expressed at various differentiation stages of particular cell or tissue types. The antibody directed against such surface antigen can thus be used for the screening of cell or tissue populations expressing the marker. For example the antibody of the invention can be used for the screening and isolation of stem cells such as embryonic stem cells hematopoietic stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells. The antibody of the invention can also be used to detect tumor cells expressing tumor associated surface antigens such c met HER2 HER3 or HER4 receptors.

An antibody or other heterologous polypeptide of the invention may be used as an affinity purification agent. In this process the polypeptide is immobilized on a solid phase such a Sephadex resin or filter paper using methods well known in the art. The immobilized polypeptide is contacted with a sample containing the antigen to be purified and thereafter the support is washed with a suitable solvent that will remove substantially all the material in the sample except the antigen to be purified which is bound to the immobilized polypeptide. Finally the support is washed with another suitable solvent such as glycine buffer pH 5.0 that will release the antigen from the polypeptide.

In one aspect the invention provides uses of a heterologous polypeptide generated using the methods of the invention in the preparation of a medicament for the therapeutic and or prophylactic treatment of a disease such as a cancer a tumor a cell proliferative disorder and or an immune such as autoimmune disorder. The heterologous polypeptide can be of any form described herein including antibody antibody fragment polypeptide e.g. an oligopeptide or combination thereof. In some embodiments the antigen is a human protein molecule and the subject is a human subject.

The heterologous polypeptides of the invention can be used to diagnose treat inhibit or prevent diseases disorders or conditions associated with abnormal expression and or activity of one or more antigen molecules including but not limited to malignant and benign tumors non leukemias and lymphoid malignancies neuronal glial astrocytal hypothalamic and other glandular macrophagal epithelial stromal and blastocoelic disorders and inflammatory angiogenic and immunologic disorders.

In certain embodiments an immunoconjugate comprising the antibody is administered to the subject. Preferably the immunoconjugate and or antigen to which it is bound is are internalized by the cell.

Heterologous polypeptides of the present invention can be used either alone or in combination with other compositions in a therapy. For instance the heterologous polypeptide may be co administered with an antibody chemotherapeutic agent s including cocktails of chemotherapeutic agents other cytotoxic agent s anti angiogenic agent s cytokines and or growth inhibitory agent s . Where the heterologous polypeptide inhibits tumor growth it may be particularly desirable to combine the heterologous polypeptide with one or more other therapeutic agent s which also inhibits tumor growth. Alternatively or additionally the patient may receive combined radiation therapy e.g. external beam irradiation or therapy with a radioactive labeled agent such as an antibody . Such combined therapies noted above include combined administration where the two or more agents are included in the same or separate formulations and separate administration in which case administration of the antibody can occur prior to and or following administration of the adjunct therapy or therapies.

The heterologous polypeptide and optionally an adjunct therapeutic agent is are administered by any suitable means including parenteral subcutaneous intraperitoneal intrapulmonary and intranasal and if desired for local treatment intralesional administration. Parenteral infusions include intramuscular intravenous intraarterial intraperitoneal or subcutaneous administration. In addition the antibody is suitably administered by pulse infusion particularly with declining doses of the antibody. Preferably the dosing is given by injections most preferably intravenous or subcutaneous injections depending in part on whether the administration is brief or chronic.

The heterologous polypeptide composition of the invention will be formulated dosed and administered in a fashion consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated the particular mammal being treated the clinical condition of the individual patient the cause of the disorder the site of delivery of the agent the method of administration the scheduling of administration and other factors known to medical practitioners. The antibody need not be but is optionally formulated with one or more agents currently used to prevent or treat the disorder in question. The effective amount of such other agents depends on the amount of antibody present in the formulation the type of disorder or treatment and other factors discussed above. These are generally used in the same dosages and with administration routes as used hereinbefore or about from 1 to 99 of the heretofore employed dosages.

For the prevention or treatment of disease the appropriate dosage of the antibody when used alone or in combination with other agents such as chemotherapeutic agents will depend on the type of disease to be treated the type of antibody the severity and course of the disease whether the antibody is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes previous therapy the patient s clinical history and response to the antibody and the discretion of the attending physician. The antibody is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease about 1 g kg to 15 mg kg e.g. 0.1 mg kg 10 mg kg of antibody is an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient whether for example by one or more separate administrations or by continuous infusion. For repeated administrations over several days or longer depending on the condition the treatment is sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. The preferred dosage of the antibody will be in the range from about 0.05 mg kg to about 10 mg kg. An initial higher loading dose followed by one or more lower doses may be administered. However other dosage regimens may be useful. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays.

In another embodiment of the invention an article of manufacture containing materials useful for the treatment of the disorders described above is provided. The article of manufacture comprises a container and a label or package insert on or associated with the container. Suitable containers include for example bottles vials syringes etc. The containers may be formed from a variety of materials such as glass or plastic.

Bacterial strains and media The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. For shake flask cultures all strains were grown in Lauria Bertani LB or C.R.A.P. phosphate limiting media 1 at 30 or 37 C. where indicated. Fermentor medium was essentially as described in reference 1. Antibiotics were added at the following concentrations 50 g mL carbenicillin 50 g mL kanamycin 12.5 g mL chloramphenicol or 20 g mL tetracycline.

Construction and evaluation of relative TIR libraries The heat stable enterotoxin II stII maltose binding periplasmic protein malE alkaline phosphatase phoA or thiol disulfide interchange protein dsbA signal peptides were PCR amplified and fused to the mature domain of the phoA gene using degenerate primers that introduced wobble based silent codon mutations 2 in the first six amino acids after the parental gene s initiation codon with a BssHII MluI or XbaI restriction site nine base pairs bps upstream of said initiation codon see Table 2 . DNAs encoding for the wild type codons of each signal sequence were also generated. These inserts were then routinely cloned into the SpeI NotI New England Biolabs sites of the pPho41 3 plasmid and transformed into competent JM109 cells Promega recovered for one hour and subcultured in 200 mL of LB supplemented with cabenicillin at 37 C. for sixteen hours and subsequently maxi prepped Qiagen . An aliquot of recovered cells from each library was plated on selective LB agar plates in order to determine library size all libraries produced between 10 100 coverage over theoretical library sizes. Purified DNA was then transformed into competent 27C7 cells and plated on LB agar plates supplemented with carbenicillin and 100 g mL 5 bromo 4 chloro 3 indolyl phosphate BCIP Sigma and grown at 37 C. for sixteen hours. Colonies that appeared light blue putatively indicated they harbored a TIR variant displaying at least a low level of PhoA activity while dark blue colonies were indicative of cells harboring strong TIR variants 4 and white colonies implied the cells were carrying TIR variants with little to no PhoA expression the percentage of blue colonies on a given agar plate for each library ranged from 2 70 . DNA from individual colonies displaying varying hues of blue was miniprepped Qiagen sequenced by SRS Analysis Genentech Inc. retransformed into competent 27C7 cells and then tested for their basal PhoA activities as previously described 3 . Briefly colonies were grown in selective LB at 30 C. for sixteen hours and diluted 1 100 into fresh media and grown for an additional four hours at 30 C. Cultures were then normalized based on optical density OD and resuspended in strict AP media 3 then stored at 20 C. overnight. Cells were then thawed partially permeabilized with toluene Sigma treatment 5 and aerated at 37 C. for one hour. Forty microliters of each culture was then added to a solution containing 1 mM disodium 4 nitrophenyl phosphate hexahydrate PNPP Promega in 1 M Tris HCl buffer pH 8.0 and incubated in darkness at room temperature for one hour. Reactions were stopped with the addition of 100 L sodium phosphate buffer pH 6.5 and the absorbance at 410 nm A was read within 20 minutes. Relative TIR strengths were calculated by first subtracting from each sample s Athe background absorbance from a culture containing empty vector pBR322 and then dividing by the corrected absorbance from a culture carrying the pPho41 plasmid. All reported TIR values are the result of at least seven replicate experiments.

Construction of antibody expression vectors Signal peptides were routinely cloned into the previously described two cistron system 1 . Heavy chain signal peptide variants were created by fusing the signal peptide of interest via splicing overlap extension SOE PCR to the heavy chain of interest and cloned into BssHII HpaI New England Biolabs sites. Light chain signal peptide variants were similarly made using SOE PCR and cloned into MluI PacI New England Biolabs or XbaI PacI New England Biolabs sites as specified by the individual TIR variant nucleotide sequence Table 2 . All construct sequences were confirmed by SRS Analysis Genentech Inc .

Protein samples were also analyzed via Coomassie blue staining following standard techniques.

Large scale induction Fermentations were performed as previously described 1 . Briefly a 500 L aliquot of cryopreserved cells from a 5 mL selective LB culture was used to inoculate 500 mL of selective LB and grown at 30 C. for 16 hours. A 10 L fermentor was then inoculated essentially as described in ref. 1 and cells were grown to a high density using a computer based algorithm to feed a concentrated glucose solution based on fermentation demands. Where indicated cells carrying the plasmid pJJ247 were induced with Where indicated cells carrying the plasmid pJJ247 were induced with isopropyl D thiogalactoside IPTG to a final concentration of 1.0 M when the cells reached an OD 200. Whole broth and normalized ODsamples were taken at regular time intervals and all fermentations were terminated after 2 3 days. Culture fitness was routinely monitored using online and offline measured parameters. Samples were analyzed using SDS PAGE analysis as described above.

HPLC analysis of samples Samples from either small or large scale induction experiments were analyzed for total insoluble and soluble heavy or light chain concentrations through a previously developed reversed phase HPLC analysis technique Lisa Wong personal communication . Samples were analyzed for light chain containing antibody species by a dual column Protein L reverse phase based HPLC assay Analytical Operations Genentech Inc. . Antibody titers were obtained by comparing chromatogram peak areas to those of a standard curve generated by spiking blank samples with known amounts of molecule of interest.

We developed novel variant translational initiation region TIR signal peptide libraries Table 2 for signal peptides representing two of the major secretion pathways for transport across the inner membrane in sec PhoA MalE and SRP DsbA STII . Each library comprises a panel of vectors with comprising variant TIRs of differing translational strengths providing a means by which to readily adjust level of translation for a given protein of interest. The maltose binding periplasmic protein MalE and alkaline phosphatase PhoA signal peptides direct translocation from the cytoplasm to the periplasm in a post translational manner with the aid of the molecular motor SecA. The heat stable enterotoxin II stII and thiol disulfide interchange protein dsbA signal peptides direct translocation in a co translational manner with aid from the signal recognition particle SRP .

During construction of the library a BssHII MluI or XbaI restriction site was inserted nine base pairs bps upstream of the parental gene s initiation codon. Depending upon the type of restriction site present different ranges of TIR strengths were observed . In general sequences bearing an MluI site displayed the smallest range of TIR strengths 1 3 while a BssHII site upstream allowed for a moderate range of TIR strengths 1 8 and an XbaI site the highest range 1 11 . These restriction sites present in the untranslated region are encompassed in the TIR 3 . While it cannot be ruled out that higher TIR variants may exist for any of the signal peptide restriction site combinations examined these results appear to be representative of the mean TIR strengths of each signal peptide library examined.

A series of plasmids was constructed to illustrate the effect of translational level and signal peptide on secretion. In each case the gene of interest was inserted downstream of the phoA promoter trp Shine Dalgarno and a signal sequence possessing a different relative TIR strength. Following transformation and induction of the phoA promoter at the shake flask scale lysates from whole cells expressing the heterologous protein the anti c met antibody clone 5D5.v2 were analyzed by SDS PAGE. In these experiments either heavy chain or light chain TIR was varied with the corresponding light chain or heavy chain respectively kept invariant.

Monitoring assembly of antibody species over time from 10 L fermentations revealed similar results to the shake flask experiments shown in . The highest amount of FL Ab was observed from samples with a DsbA derived TIR variant fused to the heavy chain and either a DsbA or PhoA derived signal peptide fused to the light chain top blot . These samples also displayed more HHL and HL dimer species than did the STII TIR one heavy chain fusion. Additionally LL dimer and free light chain was readily visible in samples with the PhoA TIR one signal peptide fused to the light chain. Examination of reduced total protein samples revealed that the DsbA signal peptide fusion resulted in more total heavy chain than the STII fusion under the expression inducing conditions of the fermentation middle blot . Similarly for the light chain signal peptide fusions a higher accumulation of light chain was observed with the DsbA TIR one signal peptide fusions than the STII TIR one bottom blot . However the highest accumulation of light chain was seen with the PhoA TIR one signal peptide fusion. The two bands seen in total light chain samples taken from the shake flasks appears as only one band in fermentation samples indicative of light chain being more efficiently processed during 10 L fermentation.

We fused different signal peptides to the mature domain of the phoA gene mPhoA to further examine the differences in total light or heavy chain expression levels when fused to either STII or DsbA derived TIR variants and expressed in shake flask cultures under inducing conditions. Similar effects on total light and heavy chain expression levels were observed . When protein expression was induced expression of mPhoA showed a concomitant rise with increased TIR strength for the DsbA signal peptide fusions up to a TIR strength of seven the highest TIR strength used in this study . A similar increase in mPhoA expression with TIR strength increase was observed for the STII signal peptide fusions up to a TIR strength of six or eight was reached whereby the amount of mPhoA appears to decrease compared to the mPhoA present in the STII TIR three sample. Strikingly more heavy and light chain was produced using a DsbA strength one TIR than using a STII strength one TIR and STII driven translocation of PhoA reached a maximum amount at a lower total protein concentration than did Dba drive translocation of PhoA. Moreover changing TIR sequence from STII to DsbA increased the dynamic range of TIR effect.

Samples from 10 L fermentations were analyzed for antibody titers using a Protein L based HPLC assay Table 3 . The HPLC data were in good agreement with qualitative titer levels revealed by Western blot analysis . When the heavy chain signal sequence was changed from a STII derived TIR variant to a Dsb derived TIR variant FL Ab titers increased 40 90 . The highest titers were produced when a DsbA one heavy chain fusion was paired with a light chain fused to either the DsbA MalE or PhoA TIR one signal peptides. Highest titers were generated when the light chain was fused to the MalE or PhoA TIR signal peptides.

By contrast FL Ab titer fell when a post translational signal peptide was fused to the heavy chain with a PhoA TIR one and MalE TIR one signal peptide fusion showing a 70 and 60 drop in titer respectively. We concluded that heavy chain expression was optimized when a co translational signal peptide e.g. DsbA was used to drive translation.

We tested the effect of chaperone overexpression. The overexpression of chaperones DsbA and DsbC sometimes termed DsbA C herein enhanced the benefits of DsbA signal peptide fused to the heavy chain and DsbA PhoA or MalE signals fused to the light chain. When compared to expression of FL Ab by a STII TIR one signal fused to the heavy and light chains SS1.1 Chaperones an approximate 2 to 2.5 fold increase in FL Ab titer was seen with a DsbA TIR one heavy chain fusion coupled with a MalE PhoA or DsbA TIR one light chain fusion.

We examined the relationship between the signal peptide fused to the light chain and heavy chain of an antibody and final antibody titers. Fully assembled antibody FL Ab titers were highest when a co translational e.g. DsbA or STII signal peptide was fused to the N terminus of the heavy chain with the DsbA derived TIR variants resulting in the maximum observed FL Ab yields. Thus DsbA TIR variants may allow for higher translation levels of passenger protein than do STII TIR variants under inducing conditions thereby resulting in higher expression levels of processed passenger protein. By contrast antibody titers dramatically fell when either post translational signal peptide i.e. MalE or PhoA was fused to the heavy chain . This effect may be due to proteolysis or may be due to a different folding pathway followed by the heavy chain 6 . An examination of total heavy chain levels from samples expressing either a PhoA or MalE TIR one signal peptide fused to the heavy chain revealed a slight shift in apparent mass potentially due to the presence of unprocessed heavy chain bottom blot .

Fusion of post translational signal peptide MalE derived or PhoA derived TIR variants to the light chain resulted in a large accumulation of processed light chain and increased antibody titers over STII mediated translocation during 10 L fermentation bottom blot . Increased yields of both light chain as well as FL Ab were also observed when the light chain was translocated by DsbA TIR variants as compared with light chain translocated by STII TIR variants. However the amount of total light chain expressed from the DsbA TIR one variant was not a great at that from the PhoA or MalE TIR one variants. Interestingly analysis of samples taken over time from 10 L fermentations indicate that FL Ab titers from runs with the light chain fused to either MalE DsbA or PhoA TIR variants continued to rise over time while fusions to STII TIR variants reached not only a lower maximum titer but reached that titer level at a much earlier time point top blot . Thus these data suggest that the light chain may be effectively translocated in either a co or post translational manner while the heavy chain requires co translational translocation for peak expression.

Expression of a one armed anti c met antibody We evaluated the relationship between the signal peptide fused to the light chain heavy chain and Fc of a one armed antibody and the final antibody titers. Plasmids were constructed using STII signal sequences with TIRs of 1 for light chain heavy chain and the Fc polypeptide using the PhoA signal sequence with a TIR of 1 SEQ ID NO 29 for light chain and DsbA signal sequence with a TIR of 1 SEQ ID NO 40 for heavy chain and the Fc fragment and using the PhoA signal sequence with a TIR of 1 for light chain and the Fc fragment and the DsbA signal sequence with a TIR of 1 for HC. Relative titer numbers were from end of run samples and were measured using the Protein L reversed phase HPLC assay described above. The relative titer values were normalized to the titer for the case in the first row of Table 4 STII signal sequences and TIR 1 for LC HC and Fc without the co expression of DsbA C.

The results are shown in Table 4. One armed antibody relative titers were highest when a co translational e.g. DsbA signal peptide was fused to the N terminus of the heavy chain post translational e.g. PhoA signal peptide was fused to the N terminus of the light chain and a post translational e.g. PhoA signal peptide was fused to the Fc region and expression was in the presence of DsbA C. In general the following hierarchy was observed with respect to the signal peptide fused to the light chain heavy chain and Fc fragment and one armed antibody expression in the presence of DsbA C P.D.D P.D.P. S.S.S. Expression levels in the absence of DsbA C were similar in all tested samples in which most of the antibody secreted to the periplasm was aggregated. Co expression of disulfide bond chaperones increased the folded antibody produced thus revealing the increased antibody expression realized by TIR optimization.

In summary this technology offers a novel means for increasing folded antibody yields for example in through manipulation of light chain and heavy chain expression via the selection from a new array of TIR variants and further by the use of co or post translational signal sequences for light chain and co translational signal sequence for heavy chain. Improved expression of one armed antibodies comprising a heavy chain a light chain and a Fc region was also accomplished using the novel TIR variants disclosed herein and further by the use of co or post translational signal sequences for light chain co translational signal sequence for heavy chain and co or post translational signal sequence for Fc polypeptide resulted. The utility of this method appears to be broadly applicable to a wide range of antibodies for example bispecific antibodies comprising knob and hole mutations antibody derivatives and bacterial based recombinant protein production as a whole.
