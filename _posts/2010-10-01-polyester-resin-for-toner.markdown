This application is a 371 of PCT JP2010 067228 filed on Oct. 1 2010 and claims priority to the following Japanese Patent Applications 2009 231747 filed on Oct. 5 2009 2010 144734 filed on Jun. 25 2010 and 2010 177886 filed on Aug. 6 2010.

The present invention relates to a polyester resin for a toner usable in developing latent images formed in for example electrophotography an electrostatic recording method an electrostatic printing method or the like a resin binder for a toner containing the polyester resin and a toner for electrophotography containing the resin binder.

In recent years with the advancements in speed up and energy conservation of the machines toners having excellent low temperature fixing ability are in demand. As resin binders for toners numerous polyesters having excellent low temperature fixing ability are being studied among which a polyester obtained by using as a raw material monomer a carboxylic acid having an aromatic ring capable of improving a glass transition temperature while maintaining a low softening point is being used.

Patent Publication 1 discloses as an objective of providing a toner for electrostatic image development having a smaller amount of smaller size fine particles which are formed as a by product during the polymerization of a toner and further having a reduced residual amount of a degradation product of a polymerization initiator remaining in the toner a method for producing a toner for electrostatic image development including the steps of suspending a polymerizable monomer composition containing at least a polymerizable monomer and a colorant in an aqueous dispersion medium containing a dispersion stabilizer to provide a suspension dispersed with liquid droplets of the above mentioned polymerizable monomer composition and polymerizing the polymerizable monomers in the above suspension including subjecting the polymerizable monomers to a suspension polymerization in the presence of a polymerization initiator to provide colored resin particles wherein in the suspending step for providing the above suspension an inhibitor for forming smaller size fine particles is contained in an aqueous dispersion medium in an amount of from 0.01 to 1 part by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the polymerizable monomer and the publication describes caffeic acid as an inhibitor for forming smaller size fine particles.

Patent Publication 2 discloses as an objective of providing a method of deinking and regenerating an image receiving sheet used in a method for forming fixed images according to electrophotography or the like a microencapsulated toner characterized in that the microencapsulated toner comprises a core material having a colorant which is reversibly capable of developing color and removing color and a shell material made of a shell forming resin for coating the core substance and the publication describes coumaric acid as a colorant.

However a toner in which a polyester obtained from a carboxylic acid having an aromatic ring as a raw material monomer is used has a disadvantage that triboelectric stability under high temperature high humidity conditions is lowered so that it is desired that toners which meet the requirements for speed up of the machines show improvements in triboelectric stability under high temperature high humidity conditions.

The present invention relates to a polyester resin for a toner capable of improving triboelectric stability under high temperature high humidity conditions while maintaining low temperature fixing ability and storage property of the toner a resin binder containing the polyester resin and a toner for electrophotography containing the resin binder.

The present invention relates to a polyester resin for a toner capable of improving triboelectric stability under high temperature high humidity conditions hereinafter also simply referred to as triboelectric stability while maintaining low temperature fixing ability storage property and durability of the toner a resin binder containing the polyester resin and a toner for electrophotography containing the resin binder.

wherein each of Rand Ris independently a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl group and X is COOR wherein Ris a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms or CHOH with proviso that a case where both of Rand Rare hydrogen atoms is excluded 

wherein each of Rand Ris independently a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl group and X is COOR wherein Ris a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms or CHOH with a carboxylic acid having an unsaturated reactive group 

The polyester resin for a toner of the present invention exhibits some excellent effects as a resin binder in a toner for electrophotography of being capable of improving triboelectric stability under high temperature high humidity conditions while maintaining low temperature fixing ability and storage property of the toner. In addition a reaction product formed between a specified aromatic compound and a carboxylic acid having an unsaturated reactive group is used in a polyester resin for a toner durability of the toner is further improved.

The polyester resin for a toner of the present invention has a feature in that the polyester resin is obtained from a specified aromatic compound having a vinylene group in the aromatic ring and there are the following two embodiments Embodiments A and B 

Embodiment A A polyester resin for a toner obtained by polycondensing a carboxylic acid component and an alcohol component in which the polyester resin is obtained using as the above mentioned carboxylic acid component and or the above mentioned alcohol component an aromatic compound represented by the formula Ia 

wherein each of Rand Ris independently a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl group and X is COOR wherein Ris a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms or CHOH with proviso that a case where both of Rand Rare hydrogen atoms is excluded.

wherein each of Rand Ris independently a hydrogen atom or a hydroxyl group and X is COOR wherein Ris a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms or CHOH with a carboxylic acid having an unsaturated reactive group 

The polyester resin for a toner of the present invention also has excellent triboelectric stability under high temperature high humidity conditions while maintaining low temperature fixing ability and storage property of the toner. Although the details of the reasons why such an excellent property is obtained are not elucidated they are considered as follows. Since the aromatic compound used in the present invention has a vinylene group in the aromatic ring it is possible to increase a glass transition temperature of a polyester obtained when used as a monomer for a polyester while keeping its softening point low and at the same time the aromatic ring is more likely to have resonance stability thereby storing electrons in the aromatic ring as compared to conventional aromatic carboxylic acid compounds such as terephthalic acid and isophthalic acid whereby consequently remarkably improving triboelectric stability especially triboelectric stability under high temperature high humidity conditions.
