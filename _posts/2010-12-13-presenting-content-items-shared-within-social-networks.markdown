title: Presenting content items shared within social networks
abstract: Within a social network, a user may establish a set of contacts who share with the user various content items and comments related thereto. However, these content items are often hosted by a content source outside of the social network, and the user may have to transition to the content source to view the content item, and then transition back to the social network to submit a comment. Instead, a device may monitor the social network to record shared content items. When the user requests a presentation of the content source, the content items hosted by the content source that have been shared with the user may be included in the presentation. The presentation of the content source may also accept comments from the user regarding a content item, and send the comments to the social network where the content item was shared with the user.

Within the field of computing many scenarios involve a social network such as a database of users and associations established thereamong to represent various types of relationships e.g. familial relations friendships and academic professional and business relationships . A user within a social network may establish a set of contacts such as individuals with whom the user has a relationship and may add new individuals as new relationships are formed. The social network may enable users to share with his or her contacts within the social network various types of messages such as personal status messages. The social network may also allow a user to view the messages shared with the user by his or her contacts such as a news feed comprising the personal status messages of the user s contacts.

Within a social network a user may share with his or her contacts one or more content items hosted by various content sources. Such content items and content sources may include e.g. web pages hosted by a website images hosted by an image database audio or video recordings hosted by an audio or video sharing service and files hosted by a file server. A user may share these content items with his or her contacts in many ways e.g. by adding an item to a set of shared content items that are of interest to the user and that may be viewable by all contacts of the user or by sending a message to a contact that references a content item. The user may also annotate the content item with a comment such as a summary of the content item or the user s personal opinions of the content item and his or her contacts may also be permitted to annotate the content item with comments. The social network may promote this sharing of content items by generating a presentation thereof e.g. upon request of a user the social network may generate a content item feed comprising the content items that have been shared with the user by his or her contacts. For a particular content item hosted by a content source e.g. an image hosted by an image database the social network may be configured to integrate the content item with the presentation or to provide a reference to the content item hosted by the content source e.g. a preview version of an image hosted by the image database and a hyperlink to an area of the image database where a full version of the image may be viewed . The content source may also permit users to submit comments regarding a content item.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

A user of a social network may find that many contacts are sharing content items with the user. For example the content items shared with the user of a social network may include content items sent by contacts of the user in private messages content items that are posted by a contact on a public message portion of the social profile of the user content items posted on a public message portion of the social profile of a contact and references to content items that are included in personal status messages of a contact. For some of these content items the user may have to view the content item outside of the social network e.g. by visiting the content source and requesting the content item. The contacts of the user may also post comments regarding the content item but these also may only be viewable by the user upon visiting the content source. However if many content items hosted my different content sources are shared with a user the user may have to visit many content sources in order to view the content items. Additionally after viewing the content item at the content source the user may wish to submit a comment regarding the content item. However if the user is viewing the content item at the content source the user may have the options of submitting a comment to be added to the content item at the content source which other users may have to visit in order to view the comment of the user and of returning to the social network and submitting a comment there e.g. by navigating back to the area of the social network where the contact of the user shared the content item and by adding a comment to that area of the social network . However the comments of the user stored by the content source are not frequently combined with the comments of the user stored by the social network resulting in a disjointed user experience. For example for a particular content item shared with the user by a contact some comments may be stored by and may appear within the social network e.g. in a news feed including the content item while other comments may be stored by and may appear in the content source e.g. in the presentation of the content item viewed at the content source . This scenario may become even more disjointed if the user belongs to several social networks such that content items may be shared with the user by contacts from several social networks resulting in an undesirable distribution of shared content items and comments relating thereto across several social networks and many content sources.

Presented herein are techniques for aggregating content items hosted by content sources and shared with a user within one or more social networks. In accordance with these techniques a device may be configured to retrieve content items shared with the user within the social network s . When the user visits a content source such as a website an image database an audio or video sharing service or a file server the device may retrieve the content items that are hosted by the content source and that have been shared with the user by a contact within a social network. The content items so retrieved may be included in a presentation of the content source to the user. The device may also permit the user to submit a comment to a content item and may send the comment back to the social network where the content item was shared.

As an exemplary application of these techniques if a user visits an image database a device may identify the set of images that are hosted by the image database and that one or more contacts of the user within the social network have shared with the user. For example the device may retrieve the actual content item a preview version of the content item e.g. a title of a post or a thumbnail of an image and or a reference to the content item e.g. a hyperlink to the content item hosted at the content source as well as any comments submitted by the contacts of the user regarding the content item where such comments are posted either within the social network or at the content source. The device may then supplement the presentation of the image database with a list of content items hosted by the image database that have been shared with the user by a contact within the social network including any comments posted about the content items within either the social network or the content source. Moreover if the user submits a comment regarding an image instead of or in addition to submitting the comment to the content source for association with the content item the device may send the comment to the social network which may associate the comment with the instance of the sharing of the content item. In this manner these techniques may improve the integration of content sources with one or more social networks by reducing the distracting transitions of the user between content sources and the social network.

To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects advantages and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.

The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident however that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.

Within the field of computing many scenarios involve a social network comprising a representation of a set of individuals and relationships thereamong. Such relationships may represent e.g. familial relations friendships shared membership in a group or activity or academic or professional relationships. The social network may permit a user to establish a set of contacts with whom the individual shares a relationship. The users of the social may then exchange messages with one or more contacts such as public status messages that may be viewed by all contacts of the user public or private messages sent to one or more contacts or chat messages exchanged in a realtime chat environment.

A social network also allows a user to share one or more content items with other users such as documents images audio and video recordings and executable applications. In some scenarios the user may upload the content item to the social network which may store the content item and may present a copy of the content item to contacts who request access to the content item. In other scenarios the user may provide a reference to a content item hosted by a content source outside of the social network such as a web page of a website an image of an image repository an audio or video recording hosted by an audio or video repository or a file hosted by a file sharing service. In these cases the user may provide a reference to the content item shared by the content source such as a uniform resource identifier URI within the domain of the content source. The social network may allow the user to share the reference to one or more contacts who may use the reference such as clicking on a hyperlink associated with the URI of the content item in order to view the content item in the context of the content source e.g. by navigating to the web page of the content source where the content item is presented . The user and his or her contacts may also submit comments in response to the content item and or in response to other comments to the content item. Such comments may either be posted at the content source e.g. within the web page of a website of the content source or within the social network e.g. associated with the reference shared by the user .

In the manner illustrated in the exemplary scenario of some social networks and content sources may facilitate discussions about content items shared within the social network . However several disadvantages may be apparent within this exemplary scenario . As a first example in order to view a particular content item shared within the social network the user may have to navigate from the domain of the social network to the domain of the content source e.g. by clicking a hyperlink provided within the social network to view a different web page within the content source where the content item is presented and may then have to navigate back to the domain of the social network . These domain transitions may be distracting and may disrupt a smooth user experience. As a second example comments to a content item may be distributed between the content source and the social network . For example with respect to a particular content item stored by a content source some comments may have been submitted in response to the message within the social network containing the reference to the content item while other comments may have been submitted to the content source while a user is viewing the content item . This distribution may result in two distinct sets of comments presented in two different locations with no crossover. Moreover a user may read a first comment posted in a first location but may inadvertently submit a second comment replying to the first comment to a second location resulting in an apparently non sequitur response in the second location and an absence of the response in the first location.

These disadvantages may be exacerbated in more complex scenarios. For example the user may belong to several social networks and may receive many messages including references to content items stored by many content sources . The comments to the content items may therefore be distributed across several social networks and several content sources and the user may have to visit many different locations in order to view all of the comments . This complexity may be further enhanced by differences in user interfaces among the social networks and or content sources . As a first example comments may be presented in a different visual manner in each location leading to frequent transitions among different aesthetics. As a second example the user interface for submitting a comment in response to a content item or another comment may be different for each location and the user may have to remember different login credentials for each location and the proprietary details of the user interface for each location. Together these complexities may impose a significant inefficiency in the user experience of a user endeavoring to view messages content items and comments distributed across and differently presented by widely disparate social networks and content sources .

Presented herein are techniques for improving the consistency of the user experience of a user while interacting with a content item hosted by a content source and shared with the user within a social network . In accordance with these techniques a device may track the sharing of content items with the user e.g. references to content items posted within personal status messages of contacts of the user in public and private messages addressing the user and in chat messages sent to the user as well as the content source hosting the respective content items . The device may also track comments associated with the content item either directly in response to the content item or in response to other comments that are stored by the social network and or the content sources . However the content items shared with the user as well as comments thereto may be numerous and varied so the presentation of an aggregated stream of content items may be voluminous and or haphazard e.g. a jumbled collection of documents images audio and video recordings and files so it may be desirable to narrow the presentation of shared content items to those that are similar to another content item that the user is currently viewing. In particular it may be desirable to detect when the user is requesting a presentation of a content source and to integrate with the presentation of the content source the shared content items that are hosted by the content source and that contacts of the user have shared with the user within the social network . In addition to reducing the number of presented content items and promoting a similarity of presented content items to those that the user may already be viewing since e.g. a particular content source typically hosts a set of content items having a similar type topic or cultural appeal this technique also improves the smoothness of the user experience of the user by avoiding a transition of domains between viewing a current content item and viewing a shared content item that is hosted by the same content source .

The information gathered in the exemplary scenario of may be used in various ways. present two exemplary scenarios featuring two similar but alternative uses of this information but those of ordinary skill in the art may devise other uses that are compatible with the techniques presented herein.

The exemplary second scenario of also features some additional advantages that may be implemented in some embodiments of these techniques and that although not so illustrated may also be implemented in the exemplary first scenario of . As a first example the content item server is configured to monitor a plurality of social networks e.g. a user may belong to a first social network to establish casual relationships such as familial relationships and friendships and a second social network to establish professional relationships such as academic and business connections. By monitoring several social networks the content item server may aggregate the presentation of content items to the user e.g. by including within a presentation of a content source the content items hosted by the content source and shared with the user within many social networks thereby further reducing transitions between domains e.g. as opposed to the user having to visit several social networks in order to consume the shared content items and further improving the smooth user experience of the user . As a second example the embodiment may permit the user to submit a comment regarding a content item which may be propagated back to the social network without having to leave the content source . For example the presentation of the content source may include a comment control that accepts a comment from the user regarding a shared content item . The embodiment may then receive the comment may identify the social network where the content item was shared with the user particularly if several social networks are monitored and may send the comment to the social network for association with the content item . Similarly though not so illustrated an embodiment may permit the user to while viewing a content item hosted by the content source request to share the content item with one or more contacts within a social network . The embodiment may then send the content item to a social network for sharing e.g. to be posted as a personal status message or in a public or private message to one or more contacts of the user within the social network thereby allowing the user to share content items within the social network without having to leave the content source . These and other features may be included in various embodiments of these techniques in order to improve the smooth user experience of the user while interacting with one or more social networks and one or more content sources .

Still another embodiment involves a computer readable medium comprising processor executable instructions configured to apply the techniques presented herein. Such computer readable media may include e.g. computer readable storage media involving a tangible device such as a memory semiconductor e.g. a semiconductor utilizing static random access memory SRAM dynamic random access memory DRAM and or synchronous dynamic random access memory SDRAM technologies a platter of a hard disk drive a flash memory device or a magnetic or optical disc such as a CD R DVD R or floppy disc encoding a set of computer readable instructions that when executed by a processor of a device cause the device to implement the techniques presented herein. Such computer readable media may also include as a class of technologies that are distinct from computer readable storage media various types of communications media such as a signal that may be propagated through various physical phenomena e.g. an electromagnetic signal a sound wave signal or an optical signal and in various wired scenarios e.g. via an Ethernet or fiber optic cable and or wireless scenarios e.g. a wireless local area network WLAN such as WiFi a personal area network PAN such as Bluetooth or a cellular or radio network and which encodes a set of computer readable instructions that when executed by a processor of a device cause the device to implement the techniques presented herein.

An exemplary computer readable storage medium that may be devised in these ways is illustrated in wherein the implementation comprises a computer readable medium e.g. a CD R DVD R or a platter of a hard disk drive on which is encoded computer readable data . This computer readable data in turn comprises a set of computer instructions configured to operate according to the principles set forth herein. In one such embodiment the processor executable instructions may be configured to perform a method of presenting content items shared with a user within a social network such as the exemplary method of and or the exemplary method of . In another such embodiment the processor executable instructions may be configured to implement a system for presenting content items shared with a user within a social network such as the exemplary system of or the exemplary system of . Some embodiments of this computer readable medium may comprise a nontransitory computer readable storage medium e.g. a hard disk drive an optical disc or a flash memory device that is configured to store processor executable instructions configured in this manner. Many such computer readable media may be devised by those of ordinary skill in the art that are configured to operate in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

The techniques discussed herein may be devised with variations in many aspects and some variations may present additional advantages and or reduce disadvantages with respect to other variations of these and other techniques. Moreover some variations may be implemented in combination and some combinations may feature additional advantages and or reduced disadvantages through synergistic cooperation. The variations may be incorporated in various embodiments e.g. the exemplary method of the exemplary system of the exemplary method of and or the exemplary system of to confer individual and or synergistic advantages upon such embodiments.

A first aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the scenarios wherein such techniques may be utilized. As a first example these techniques may be applied to many types of social networks including social networks representing real world relationships such as familial relations and friendships academic social networks representing connections among students and teachers professional social networks representing professional associations among colleagues and themed social networks representing connections among users sharing an interest such as participants in an online game. Additionally an embodiment of these techniques may monitor a plurality of social networks since a user may have established social profiles on several such social networks e.g. a first social network comprising a genealogy network involving familial relationships a second social network comprising a friendship network involving friend relationships a third social network comprising a professional network involving academic and colleague relationships and a fourth social network comprising an activity oriented network for members of a shared activity such as participation in an online game . The embodiment may also monitor such social networks on behalf of a plurality of users represented therein and possibly scaling up to a large number of users or even an entire population of one or more social networks .

As a second example of this first aspect these techniques may be utilized to present users with many types of content items such as web pages hosted by a website images hosted by an image database audio or video recordings hosted by an audio or video sharing service and files hosted by a file server. The content item may also include a comment related thereto and or one or more metadata items describing the sharing of the content item and or one or more comments such as a title of the shared content item or a date of the sharing of the content item or authoring of the comment .

As a third example of this first aspect a user of a social network may share a content item with a contact of the user within the social network in many ways. For example a user may submit a public status message that is not directed to any contact but that is viewable by some or all contacts of the user a public or private message to a user such as a private or public dialogue between the user and one or more contacts or a chat message in a realtime chat environment. Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many scenarios wherein the techniques presented herein may be utilized.

A second aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the receiving of content items hosted by content sources that have been shared with the user within a social network . As a first example and as illustrated in the exemplary scenario of a device operated by the user may actively or passively monitor the sharing of content items with the user on one or more social networks and may also generate presentations of content sources to the user . For example the user may utilize a device that monitors the social networks as a background service while also fulfilling requests from the user for presentations of content sources e.g. a foreground web browser that the user may operate to view web pages provided by content sources . Alternatively and as illustrated in the exemplary scenario of the receiving may be performed by a content item server that monitors the social network s to identify shared content items and that sends shared content items to a client operated by the user that generates a presentation of the content source of the content items . The client operated by the user also receives the content items in this scenario but receives such content items from the content item server instead of from the social networks . For example upon receiving a request from a user for a presentation of a particular content source such as a particular website hosting a set of content items the client may notify a content item server of the content source for which the user has requested a presentation and may receive from the content item server the content items that are hosted by the content source and that have been shared with the user within one or more social networks .

As a second example of this second aspect an embodiment of these techniques may communicate with one or more social networks in various ways. As a first such example the embodiment may communicate with the social network s according to a push model such as where the social networks actively notify the embodiment when a contact shares a content item with the user . As a first such example the embodiment may communicate with the social network s according to a pull model e.g. by configuring the embodiment to on a periodic basis retrieve the content items shared by one or more contacts with the user .

As a third example of this second aspect an embodiment of these techniques may also receive from one or more social networks comments pertaining to various content items . A social network may be configured to send the comments along with content items to which such comments relate. Alternatively the embodiment may query the social network for content items and may separately query the social network for comments to such content items . One such embodiment may query one or more social networks for newly shared content items at a different frequency than querying the same social networks for comments associated with previously shared content items . For example it may be advantageous to configure the embodiment to poll a social network to retrieve content items at a first frequency and to poll the social network to retrieve comments associated with the content items at a second frequency that is higher than the first frequency e.g. polling for newly shared content items every ten minutes but polling for comments to content items every two minutes . This configuration may be advantageous e.g. for retrieving comments to content items more quickly since such comments may comprise a near realtime conversation among the user and his or her contacts with a high value on promptly exchanged comments while rapidly polling for the sharing of new content items that may initiate a new conversation may be less valuable.

As a fourth example of this second aspect shared content items received from one social network may be combined with shared content items received from another social network . Alternatively or additionally comments to a content item that have been posted on a first social network may be combined with comments to the same content item posted by a second social network and or with comments posted at the content source . For example a content item that is hosted by a content source is shared with a user within two social networks the embodiment may receive and combine the comments to the content item posted within the first social network the comments to the content item posted within the second social network and the comments to the content item posted within the content source . These comments may be combined by the embodiment such as in the comment data set to form a conversation unified among all of these disparate sources of comments .

As a fifth example of this second aspect an embodiment of these techniques may retain the retrieved content items and or comments thereto for a particular duration. For example a content item server may be configured to receive many content items shared with many users of one or more social networks . However it may be advantageous to discard content items and or comments that are older than a particular content item duration such as one month after the date of sharing and or commenting in order to conserve the computing resources of the content item server . Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many ways of configuring an embodiment to receive content items while implementing the techniques presented herein.

A third aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the generation of a presentation of a content source and the content items hosted by the content source that have been shared with the user within one or more social networks . As a first example many presentations of many types of content sources may be generated. One such presentation involves a request to render the content source in a web browser where an embodiment of these techniques may adjust the web page provided by the content source in order to integrate into the content source the content items hosted by the content source and shared with the user within a social network . The web page may have been provided by the content source in a state ready for such adjustment e.g. if the content source cooperatively structures the web page for the insertion of shared content items or an embodiment of these techniques may adjust the web page even if the content source does not provide the web page in such a form. In these embodiments it may be convenient to implement the embodiment of these techniques as a web browser plug in configured to adjust web pages according to this first example of this third aspect.

As a second example of this third aspect the presentation of a content source may be adjusted in many ways to integrate shared content items . As a first such example shared content items that have been shared with the user within a social network may be included with other content items e.g. if the user submits a search query for particular content items within the content source an embodiment may insert shared content items into the search results whether or not such shared content items relate to the search query submitted by the user . Alternatively the shared content items may be presented separately from other content of the content source . For example the shared content items may be presented in a separate browser window or when the user submits a search query to the content source the shared content items may be presented interstitially after receiving the search query but before displaying the search results. In other such embodiments the shared content items may be presented peripherally with respect to the content of the content source requested by the user . For example if the user visits a web page within the domain of a content source the resulting presentation such as the rendered web page may comprise a primary presentation of the content source and a secondary presentation comprising a content item list of shared content items where the secondary presentation is positioned peripherally with respect to the primary presentation. The shared content items may also be presented in full e.g. as full size images or embedded videos and or as preview versions e.g. as thumbnail representations of full size images or as screen captures or segments of videos . In the latter scenario respective preview versions of the content items may be selectable to view a full version of the content item e.g. a system embodiment of these claims may include a content item viewing component that upon receiving from the user a selection of a preview version of a content item presents the full version of the content item .

As a third example of this third aspect the presentation of shared content items may be adjusted in many ways. As a first such example the shared content items may be sorted such as according to alphabetical or numerical order or popularity. The shared content items may also be sorted according to relevance e.g. with respect to details of the user represented in a user profile with respect to a content item hosted by the content source that is currently viewed by the user or with respect to a search query submitted by the user to the content source . As a second such example the shared content items included in the presentation may be filtered in various ways e.g. if the user selects a particular social network and or a particular contact the content items included in the presentation may be filtered to include only the content items that have been shared with the user within the selected social network and or by the selected contact . Filtering may also be implemented to improve the novelty of the presented content items by recording the presentation of content items to the user and removing from the presentation shared content items that have been previously presented to the user . Filtering may also be implemented to reduce redundancy of presented content items e.g. a particularly popular content item may be redundantly hosted several times on one or more content sources and may be shared with the user multiple times possibly including different references and even different content sources but an embodiment of these techniques may identify the redundancy and consolidate the presentation of the content item .

As a fourth example of this third aspect one or more content items may be associated with one or more comments either directly in response to the content item or in response to other comments associated therewith and the presentation of a content source may include the comments to content items hosted by the content source . However it may be undesirable to display all of the comments to the content items in the presentation e.g. a popular content item may be associated with many comments and displaying all of the comments may lead to an undesirably large presentation . Instead for content items associated with at least one comment a comment indicator may be included in the presentation and upon receiving a selection by the user of the comment indicator one or more comments associated with the content item may be displayed.

As a fifth example of this third aspect a presentation of shared content items hosted by a content source as updates are received to the set of shared content items or comments thereto. Accordingly an embodiment of these techniques may be extended e.g. by adding a content item updating component to a system embodiment of these techniques in order to update the presentation . As a first such example upon receiving from a social network an update to a content item while presenting to the user the content source hosting the content item a content item server may send the update to the user e.g. to a client operated by the user for inclusion in the presentation . As a second such example upon receiving an update involving a content item hosted by a content source where the content item has been newly shared with the user within a social network while the user is viewing a presentation of the content source an embodiment may supplement the presentation of the content source with the content item . This supplementing may also include comments to a content item e.g. if a social network receives a comment to a content item hosted by a content source while a user is viewing a presentation of the content source the presentation may be supplemented by including the comment to the content item . It may be particularly advantageous to configure an embodiment of these techniques to supplement the presentation with newly received comments promptly after such comments are posted to the social network in order to promote a sustained near realtime conversation about the content item such as a chat session. Various technologies such as push technologies and or protocols such as Asynchronous JavaScript and XML AJAX may be utilized to achieve the updating of a presentation such as a web page.

As a sixth example of this third aspect an embodiment may be configured to adjust a presentation of a content source in order to permit additional user actions relating to these techniques that the user may be allowed to perform. For example an embodiment of these techniques may permit a user viewing a content item hosted by a content source to share the content item with one or more contact within a social network so that the user does not have to transition from the content source to a social network in order to share the content item . For example a presentation of a content item may include options for allowing the user to send to a social network a reference to the content item as a personal status message or as a public or private message directed to one or more contacts and may also permit the user to include a comment relating thereto. If the user belongs to several social networks the embodiment may send the content item to all of the social networks or to a default social network among the set of social networks or may allow the user to specify one or more social networks within which the content item is to be shared. Similar extensions may be provided for receiving from the user a comment to a content item and automatically sending the comment to one or more social networks so that the user does not have to transition from the content source to a social network in order to submit the comment . Moreover it may be advantageous to identify a social network within which the content item was shared with the user and to send the comment to the identified social network . The presentation may also permit a user to edit and or remove from the social network a shared content item e.g. by deleting a personal status message or a public message sent to the user that includes a reference to the content item and or a comment to a content item . Alternatively or additionally the presentation may be extended to permit other types of user actions such as viewing a user profile of a contact who has shared a content item with the user or initiating a public or private message or a chat session with a contact who has shared the content item . A presentation may be adjusted to support these additional user actions in many ways e.g. by inserting user controls into the presentation or providing a context menu including the user actions and or may be extensible by the user . Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many ways of generating a presentation of a content source to a user while implementing the techniques presented herein.
