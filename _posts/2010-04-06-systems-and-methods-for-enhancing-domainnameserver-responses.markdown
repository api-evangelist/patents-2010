Organizations face an ever increasing number of distracting and harmful intrusions as their members use and navigate the Internet. Malicious inappropriate and or irrelevant websites may consume precious network bandwidth and resources serve to propagate malware within an organization decrease productivity and or degrade an organization s work environment.

In order to address these problems organizations may deploy a variety of endpoint security systems for monitoring classifying and or filtering access to Internet resources. For example when an endpoint user attempts to access an Internet resource such as website a traditional endpoint security system may make outbound requests to one or more information providers in an attempt to classify the Internet resource in order to decide whether to allow the user to access the resource. Unfortunately such outbound requests may add unwanted latency to the user s attempt to access the Internet resource. Accordingly the instant disclosure identifies a need for enhancing domain name server responses.

As will be described in greater detail below the instant disclosure generally relates to systems and methods for enhancing domain name server responses. In one example one or more of the various systems described herein may accomplish this task by 1 receiving a domain name system request 2 identifying a domain of the domain name system request 3 retrieving classification information relating to the domain from a third party system and then 4 including the classification information in a response to the domain name system request.

The classification information may include a variety of information such as a rating a trust level and or a content category. Retrieving the classification information may include a variety of steps. For example retrieving the classification information may include 1 identifying an Internet classification provider 2 transmitting information identifying the domain to the Internet classification provider and 3 receiving the classification information from the Internet classification provider. In one example identifying the Internet classification provider may include identifying a plug in for the Internet classification provider.

In some examples retrieving the classification information may include 1 identifying a time to live value for the classification information 2 determining that the time to live value for the classification information has not expired and 3 retrieving the classification information from a local cache. In various examples the domain name system request may be made within a domain name system hierarchy and the third party system may include a system outside of the domain name system hierarchy.

Including the classification information in the response to the domain name system request may include a variety of steps. For example including the classification information in the response may include including the classification information in a text record in the response. Additionally or alternatively including the classification information in the response may include 1 identifying a time to live value for the classification information and 2 including the time to live value for the classification information in the response. In some examples including the time to live value in the response may include 1 identifying a time to live value for a resolution of the domain 2 determining that the time to live value for the classification information is less than the time to live value for the resolution of the domain and 3 using the time to live value for the classification information as the time to live value for the resolution of the domain in the response. In other examples including the time to live value in the response may include including the time to live value for the classification information as a separate record within the response.

As will be described in greater detail below by including classification information for domains in responses to domain name system requests for the domains the systems and methods described herein may provide information required by endpoint security products without requiring the endpoint security products to make separate queries to third parties. This may conserve network resources reduce latency e.g. by caching the information on a domain name system server as well as offload network traffic from the third parties.

Network may facilitate communication or data transfer using wireless or wired connections. In one embodiment network may facilitate communication between client system domain name system server and or third party system .

As illustrated in at step one or more of the systems described herein may receive a domain name system request. For example at step receiving module may as part of domain name system server in receive request from client system . As used herein the term domain name system request may refer to any request and or query to a domain name system server. For example a domain name system request may include a request to resolve a domain name to an IP address.

Receiving module may perform step in any suitable manner. In one example receiving module may receive the domain name system request directly from a client system. In other examples receiving module may receive the domain name system request in a message from a portion of a domain name system server. For example receiving module may receive the domain name system request from a network filter driver configured to intercept domain name system requests.

At step one or more of the systems described herein may identify a domain of the domain name system request. For example at step identification module may as part of domain name system server in identify domain of request . As used herein the term domain may refer to any domain and or hostname that may be sent as part of a request and or query to a domain name system server.

Identification module may perform step in any suitable manner. For example identification module may identify the domain of the domain name system request by parsing the domain name system request for the domain. For example identification module may identify the domain as www.google.com www.wellsfargo.com etc.

At step one or more of the systems described herein may retrieve classification information relating to the domain from a third party system. For example retrieval module may as part of domain name system server in retrieve classification information from third party system .

As used herein the term classification information may refer to any information that a third party may provide about a domain e.g. beyond information pertaining to resolving a domain name to an IP address . For example the classification information may include a rating of the domain. Such a rating may indicate the reliability of a site or sites hosted at the domain the popularity of a site hosted at the domain the frequency of updates to a site hosted at the domain and or any other metric potentially of interest to the client system and or an application such as a security application on the client system.

Additionally or alternatively the classification information may include a trust level corresponding to the domain. In this example the trust level may indicate the security of a site hosted at the domain e.g. as against malware phishing etc. the level of moderation of a site hosted at the domain the reliability of outbound links from a site hosted at the domain etc.

In some examples the classification information may include a content category of a site hosted at the domain. For example if the domain is www.google.com the content category may include search. Likewise if the domain is www.wellsfargo.com the content category may include banking. Other examples of content categories may include food automotive sports textiles etc. In some examples the classification information may include other categories descriptive of the domain such as public private etc.

In some embodiments the classification information may include information geared for certain applications installed on client systems. For example an anti phishing application on a client system may be configured to recognize a banking category in the classification information.

Retrieval module may perform step in a variety of ways. For example retrieval module may retrieve the classification information by 1 identifying an Internet classification provider e.g. on the third party system 2 transmitting information identifying the domain to the Internet classification provider and later 3 receiving the classification information from the Internet classification provider. As used herein the term Internet classification provider may refer to any service interface module system and or party that provides classification information for a domain. For example Internet classification providers may include anti malware services rating services trust services etc.

In some examples retrieval module may identify the Internet classification provider by identifying a plug in for the Internet classification provider. As used herein the term plug in may refer to any plug in extension add on module and or configuration data for indicating locating and or providing access to an Internet classification provider. As an example illustrates an exemplary system with a domain name system cache server connected to third party systems via network . As illustrated in this figure domain name system server may include plug ins corresponding to third party systems respectively. Retrieval module may identify third party system as an Internet classification provider by identifying a plug in for retrieving information from third party system .

In some examples the plug in may include executable instructions for retrieving the classification information from the Internet classification provider. Additionally or alternatively the plug in may include a location of the third party system acting as the Internet classification provider.

Retrieval module may transmit the information identifying the domain to the Internet classification provider in any suitable manner. For example retrieval module may use a published Application Programming Interface API implemented by the Internet classification provider. For example retrieval module may use a web interface in the following format 

For example if a service of the Internet classification provider were hosted at www.secure.com dnstxt and the domain in the DNS request were www.wellsfargo.com retrieval module may generate the following web based request 

In some examples retrieval module may retrieve the classification information from the third party system by retrieving a cached copy of the classification information that came from the third party system. For example retrieval module may 1 identify a time to live value for the classification information 2 determine that the time to live value for the classification information has not expired and then 3 retrieve the classification information from a local cache. As used herein a time to live value may refer to any value indicating how long information may be relied upon and or how long information may be cached before needing to update and or refresh the information. For example a time to live value may include one or more values stored in HTTP headers such as a Cache Control header and or an Expires header.

Retrieval module may identify the time to live value for the classification information in any suitable manner. For example retrieval module may parse an HTTP message that contained the classification information returned by the third party system. For example retrieval module may parse the HTTP message for Cache Control and or Expires headers. In some embodiments retrieval module may have previously determined the time to live value for the classification information e.g. by parsing an HTTP message containing the classification information and stored the time to live value in a local cache. In these embodiments retrieval module may identify the time to live value by accessing the time to live value from the local cache.

Upon determining that the time to live value for the classification information has not expired retrieval module may retrieve the classification information from the local cache. For example retrieval module may store responses from third party systems in a database. Retrieval module may then verify that information for a domain currently at issue has not expired and accordingly retrieve the information from the database. For example if the domain in the domain name system request is www.wellsfargo.com retrieval module may consult the database to determine that classification information for www.wellsfargo.com has previously been retrieved and that this classification information has not yet expired. Retrieval module may accordingly retrieve the classification information from the database rather than retrieving the classification information directly from the third party system again.

Using as an example retrieval module may retrieve classification information as cached on domain name system cache server rather than retrieving classification information directly from third party systems again. This may save time thereby reducing latency experienced on a client system. Additionally retrieving the classification information from a local cache rather than the third party system may reduce the load on the third party system. As such the methods and systems described herein may allow for Internet classification providers that are created and maintained by parties with modest resources. For example by allowing the Internet classification providers to set a time to live value for classification information and only querying the Internet classification providers once per domain per time to live period Internet classification providers may leverage the resources of a domain name system server rather than handling traffic from all interested clients e.g. classification information cached locally on domain name system cache server in may server client systems k rather than requiring client systems k to individually request classification information from third party systems .

In some examples the domain name system request may be made within a domain name system hierarchy. In these examples the third party system may include a system outside the domain name system hierarchy. Using as an example client system may transmit a domain name system request to domain name system cache server which may be configured to refresh domain resolution information from domain name system authoritative server . Accordingly the domain name system hierarchy for client system may include domain name system cache server and authoritative server . However third party systems may exist outside of this hierarchy.

Returning to at step one or more of the systems described herein may include the classification information in a response to the domain name system request. For example at step response module may as part of domain name system server in include classification information in response to client system .

Response module may perform step in any suitable manner. For example response module may include the classification information in the response by including the classification information in a text record in the response. As used herein the term text record or TXT record may refer to any record and or field in a response to a domain name system request capable of holding arbitrary data relating to the domain e.g. classification information .

In some examples response module may place a time to live value on the classification information. For example response module may identify a time to live value for the classification information and then include the time to live value for the classification information in the response. Response module may identify the time to live value in any suitable manner. For example response module may identify a time to live value assigned to the classification information by the third party system. Additionally or alternatively response module may select a time to live value for the classification information. For example response module may have gathered classification information from several third party systems. Each third party system may have assigned a different time to live value to its respective classification information. In this example response module may select the smallest time to live value.

As another example response module may identify a time to live value for a resolution of the domain e.g. how long an IP address may be associated with the domain before the domain name system server must refresh its information from an authoritative name server . Response module may then determine that the time to live value for the classification information is less than the time to live value for the resolution of the domain. Response module may accordingly use the time to live value for the classification information as the time to live value for the resolution of the domain in the response. In this manner a client program may seek to refresh all information relating to the domain when any of the information expires.

Rather than reducing various time to live values to a single time to live value for the response response module may include the time to live value for the classification information in the response by including the time to live value for the classification information as a separate record within the response e.g. in a TXT record associated with a TXT record for the classification information .

As described above by including classification information for domains in responses to domain name system requests for the domains the systems and methods described herein may provide information required by endpoint security products without requiring the endpoint security products to make separate queries to third parties. This may conserve network resources reduce latency e.g. by caching the information on a domain name system server as well as offload network traffic from the third parties. For example a client system may request that a domain name system server return an address for www.wellsfargo.com . The domain name system server may not only fetch the address but may also apply various plug ins registered in the server to the domain to fetch information about the domain. The domain name server may then respond to the domain name system request with the address of www.wellsfargo.com as well as information such as Trusted Public Corporation Bank Shasta Trust Verification No Malware etc.
