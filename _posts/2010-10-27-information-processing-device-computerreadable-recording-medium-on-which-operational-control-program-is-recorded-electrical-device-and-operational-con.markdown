However applications of the API in the present embodiment are not limited to these examples.

The operation portion is constituted by a mouse pointer or a keyboard and the like and receives various instructions from the operator through operations of the operator. That is in the present embodiment the operator can generate display screens to be displayed on the display portion of the multifunction peripheral from either the PC or the server computer SV by operating the operation portion of the PC or the operation portion of the server computer SV.

The display portion is constituted by an LCD liquid crystal display or the like and displays various images in accordance with display control by the control unit .

As described above in the present embodiment the server computer SV indicates a system that carries out server management type processing of managing the aforementioned screen data so that processes up to screen data generation are carried out by the screen data generation portion in the PC then the generated screen data is transmitted to the server computer SV through the communications portion and the storage portion of the server computer SV stores this generated screen data then in accordance with a screen data output instruction from the multifunction peripheral the business logic and the script interpreter read out from the storage portion the screen data indicated by this output instruction and furthermore jobs and services associated with the display object parts indicated by the parts specification instruction from the multifunction peripheral are transmitted from the communications portion to the multifunction peripheral or the external device. In this case the server computer SV is one example of an information processing device within the scope of the claims.

On the other hand the multifunction peripheral is provided with the controller a storage portion the platform an intermediary application the web browser and the display portion .

The controller administers the overall operational control of the multifunction peripheral . The controller is provided as firmware and executes basic functions of the multifunction peripheral such as transmission of scan data printing data access system settings network communications job control and data registration.

The platform is a foundation for the API application programming interface and the like to operate. The platform is also responsible for relays between the controller and the API.

Further still the platform obtains from the server computer SV via the LAN or the like display data of screen data that is for display objects of the display portion data after HTML conversion processing by the script interpreter and various instructions.

It should be noted for example that at time when a display screen for example an application selection screen of or the like is displayed on the display portion the controller carries out an inquiry to the extended application of the server computer SV via the platform when there is a pressing operation of a scan button one example of a display object part by the operator using the touch panel function or the like. That is the controller sends to the extended application of the server computer SV a parts specification instruction indicating that the scan button has been specified by the operator via the platform and the business logic of the extended application analyzes the job or service that is set for the display object part the scan button indicating that parts specification instruction.

It should be noted that in a case where the display object part indicating the parts specification instruction is the scan button as in this example and the job or service analyzed in the business logic of the extended application is a job meaning transition to display screen of the display portion of the multifunction peripheral in order to enable a display screen transition to a scan setting screen shown in for example the script interpreter of the extended application commences analysis of the screen data which is constituted by a script file stored in the storage portion and data conversion to HTML format. The business logic generates a control command API for executing the display screen transition which is the analyzed job on the multifunction peripheral .

The storage portion is constituted by an HDD or the like and stores an operational control program to cause operation as the controller and a program of the web browser and the like. The CPU which is the central control portion of the multifunction peripheral functions as the controller and the web browser and the like by operating in accordance with the programs stored in the storage portion .

The intermediary application carries out an intermediary process to enable the display data which was received by the platform from the server computer SV and has undergone HTML conversion processing to be processed by the web browser .

The web browser displays on the display portion the display data that has undergone HTML conversion processing which is obtained from the script interpreter and the business logic . In the present embodiment the web browser is an interface that displays display screens on the display portion conforming to screen components indicated by a file that has undergone HTML conversion processing which is converted by the extended application and receives instruction input operations from the operator during display of this display screen via the touch panel function of the display portion .

The display portion is constituted by an LCD liquid crystal display or the like and displays various images in accordance with display control by the controller .

Further description is given regarding screen display processing and operational control in the operational control system . is a schematic diagram showing screen display processing and operational control in the operational control system . Here description is given using an example of the aforementioned server management type processing in which screen data generated by the PC is stored in the storage portion of the server computer SV and operational control of the multifunction peripheral is carried out between the multifunction peripheral and the server computer SV based on a pressing operation by the operator of display object parts in the display screens displayed on the display portion of the multifunction peripheral .

When the power is turned on at the multifunction peripheral the web browser displays a predetermined initial display screen on the display portion .

When the multifunction peripheral requires screen data to display a display screen on the display portion such as when switching the display screens the platform transmits to the server computer SV an output instruction of screen data to display a display screen on its display portion under the control of the web browser and the controller .

The business logic analysis portion of the server computer SV receives the output instruction from the multifunction peripheral as an on load event. The business logic carries out on load processing based on this on load event. That is the business logic reads out from the storage portion via the script interpreter the screen data of the display screen indicated by the output instruction and this is transmitted from the communications portion to the platform of the multifunction peripheral after the screen data is converted to HTML format by the script interpreter .

In the multifunction peripheral the HTML format screen data is received by the platform and the received screen data is display by the web browser on the display portion .

Here when any of the display buttons the display object parts functions as the display buttons are pressed on the display screen by an operation of the operator using the touch panel function during display of the display screen by the web browser the parts specification instruction indicated by the display object part that has been pressed is received by the web browser and this parts specification instruction is sent from the web browser via the platform and the communications portion and the like to the business logic of the extended application of the server computer SV.

In relation to the display object part indicated by the parts specification instruction the business logic analyzes the job or service or both hereinafter simply referred to as job or the like associated with that display object part based on the screen data stored in the storage portion .

When the business logic analyzes that the job or the like associated with the display object part indicated by the parts selection instruction is a job of the multifunction peripheral the business logic calls an API call from a control logic of the multifunction peripheral constituted by a control logic group for performing operational control of the various operational mechanisms of the multifunction peripheral indicated by middleware stored in the storage portion an API corresponding to the job or the like for executing the analyzed job on the multifunction peripheral and executes the API on the multifunction peripheral via the communications portion . Here in a case where the analyzed job is an operation of the operational mechanisms of the multifunction peripheral but is an operation that is newly generated and set by the operator the business logic calls an API corresponding to that job based on the business logic constituted by a control logic group of jobs newly generated and set by the operator indicated by the middleware that is stored in the storage portion and executes the API on the multifunction peripheral via the communications portion .

It should be noted that in a case where the analyzed job or the like is a service using the external device other than the multifunction peripheral the business logic calls an API corresponding to that service based on the business logic constituted by a control logic group of predetermined services of the external devices indicated by the middleware that is stored in the storage portion and executes the API on the relevant external device via the communications portion .

In the multifunction peripheral the API accesses to the controller in the firmware of the multifunction peripheral through the platform and the controller executes the job corresponding to the API. Alternatively in the interface of the external device the API accesses to the control portion in the firmware of the external device through the interface and the control portion executes the service corresponding to the API.

The operator inputs a display screen generation instruction by operating the operation portion of the PC for example. When the display screen generation instruction input by the operator is received at the control portion P the control portion commences screen data generation processing P based on the display screen generation program stored in the storage portion . For example the control portion displays on the display portion display data of a customization receiving screen as shown in an example in P . In this customization receiving screen a list of multiple display object parts stored by the display screen generation program which is stored in the storage portion is displayed in a toolbox region D.

For example in accordance with an operation or the like in which a settings control display area D of the customization receiving screen is specified by a left click by the operator at the operation portion which is constituted by a mouse pointer or the like when an instruction in which a display object part is selected indicated by an image name displayed in this display area D is received by the control portion P the control portion displays a display object part i that has been specified within a display region D which constitutes one portion of the customization receiving screen as shown in .

Then in accordance with an operation or the like specified by a left click by the operator at the operation portion which is constituted by a mouse pointer or the like the control portion displays in the display portion a job and service title list screen as shown in for example. For example the control portion displays the job and service title list screen overlaid over the customization receiving screen which is already displayed.

When a job desired by the operator is selected by specifying a display area D in which the desired job title is being displayed in the job and service title list screen by an operation or the like of the operation portion by the operator during display of the job and service title list screen on the display portion the selection instruction is received by the job selection instruction receiving portion P . At this time the control portion may display in the display region D the selected job title overlaid over the display object part.

Further still for example when a service desired by the operator is selected by further specifying a display area D in which the desired service title is being displayed in the job and service title list screen by a right click operation or the like of the operation portion which is constituted by a mouse pointer or the like the selection instruction is received by the external service selection instruction receiving portion P . At this time the control portion may display in the display region D the selected service title overlaid over the display object part.

It should be noted in regard to the processing of the aforementioned P and P that it is possible for only one of these to be carried out selectively or for both to be carried out.

For example with the aforementioned series of processes by operating the operation portion the operator can associate a job such as execute scan operation or send file of scanned image data to PC and a service such as carry out image processing of redeye removal processing on image data of file received from multifunction peripheral with the selected display object part. For this reason by operating the operation portion the operator can simply generate screen data of display screens provided with operation buttons display object parts for inputting instructions by which a job by the multifunction peripheral such as execute scan operation and send file of scanned image data to PC and a service by the external device such as carry out image processing of redeye removal processing on image data of file received from multifunction peripheral are carried out in cooperation.

Further still when the operator moves a display object part displayed in the region D by a drag and drop operation of operation portion which is constituted by a mouse pointer or the like to change a display position of the display object part in the region D the position in the region D of the display object part changed by the operator is set as a layout instruction indicating the position of the display object part in the display screen and this layout instruction is received by the layout instruction receiving portion P .

It should be noted in regard to the processes in the aforementioned P to P that the selection receiving processing of jobs and services is repeated P for multiple display object parts until the operator using the PC clicks a finish button unshown of the customization receiving screen using the mouse or the like thereby inputting from the operator an instruction to finish display screen generation.

When the instruction to finish display screen generation is inputted from the operator and received by the control portion yes at P the selected jobs and services are associated with each of the display object parts respectively in accordance with the display object parts for which a job or service selection has been received at that time point and the layout instructions for the display object parts and screen data is generated by the screen data generation portion P .

After screen data generation by the screen data generation portion the screen data generation portion transmits the generated screen data to the server computer SV using the communications portion P .

In the server computer SV when the generated screen data is received by the communications portion V the screen data is stored in the storage portion by the control unit V .

Furthermore in a case where all of the processes from generation of screen data to storage of screen data is carried out by the server computer SV the processes of the aforementioned P to P are carried out by the server computer SV and the generated screen data is stored in the storage portion .

Next description is given regarding display processing of display screens on the display portion of the multifunction peripheral using the generated screen data and operational execution control of the multifunction peripheral based on an instruction to execute operation from the operator with the operational control system . is a flowchart showing display processing of display screens on the display portion of the multifunction peripheral using the generated screen data and operational execution control of the multifunction peripheral based on an instruction to execute operation from the operator with the operational control system according to the first embodiment. It should be noted that here also description is given using server management type processing as an example.

It should be noted that in a case where the server computer SV is connected to multiple multifunction peripherals by carrying out the processing indicated below with any of the connected multifunction peripherals it is possible to display the display screens on the display portion of each of the multifunction peripherals to carry out operational execution control of the multifunction peripherals .

In the multifunction peripheral when a necessity arises to display a display screen on the display portion yes at F based on an instruction or the like according to an operation of an unshown operational portion by the operator the controller transmits an output instruction to the server computer SV via the platform to an effect of requesting transmission of screen data of the display screen corresponding to that operation F .

In the server computer SV when the communications portion receives the output instruction SS the script interpreter reads out SS from the storage portion the screen data script file indicating the output instruction then analyzes the screen data that has been read out and carries out HTML conversion processing for displaying the display screen on the display portion .

That is the script interpreter carries out data conversion processing of converting to a data format HTML format in the present embodiment that can be displayed on the display portion by the web browser of the multifunction peripheral and carries out a process of constructing a display screen indicated by the script file by assigning character strings to screens and buttons using screen templates button templates and character string data which are structural elements of the display screens as display object parts in response to the number and placement of keys to be displayed within the screen indicated by the script files.

Following this the business logic transmits the data that has undergone the HTML processing obtained from the script interpreter to the platform of the multifunction peripheral from the communications portion as display data that is displayable on the display portion SS .

When the platform of the multifunction peripheral receives F the screen data of HTML format data from the server computer SV the web browser displays this screen data on the display portion F .

When any of the display buttons display object parts displayed on the display portion is pressed yes at F by an operation or the like of the operator using the touch panel function during display of the display screen by the web browser the parts specification instruction indicated by the pressed display button display object part is sent from the web browser via the platform to the server computer SV F .

Here in a case where parts specification instructions have been set by the operator in regard to both a display button display object part associated with a job executable by the multifunction peripheral and a display button display object part associated with a service executable by an external device other than the multifunction peripheral which is set separately to this the web browser receives the parts specification instructions in regard to these display buttons display object parts respectively. In this case at F the parts specification instructions indicated by the display buttons display object parts that have been pressed respectively are sent from the web browser to the server computer SV via the platform .

When the parts specification instructions are received by the communications portion in the server computer SV the business logic analyzes SS the jobs and services associated with the display buttons display object parts indicated by the parts specification instructions based on information data stored in the storage portion screen data of display screens including the display object parts indicated by the parts specification instructions which has been transferred from the script interpreter .

Here in a case where the communications portion of the server computer SV has received multiple parts specification instructions the business logic performs analysis on the jobs and services associated with the display object parts indicated by the multiple parts specification instructions for each of the display object parts respectively.

For example in the application selection screen shown in when the scan button is pressed by the operator among the four operation buttons and as display object parts and the pressing of this operation button is received by the web browser the parts selection instruction indicating the operation button display object part that has been pressed is sent to the server computer SV.

In this case based on the screen data stored in the storage portion the business logic of the server computer SV analyzes that the job corresponding to the scan button as the display object part indicating the parts selection instruction is a job of execute scan operation and send file of scanned image data to PC for example.

Alternatively in a case where the scan setting screen of is being displayed on the display portion when the color setting button is pressed by the operator and the pressing of this operation button is received by the web browser the parts specification instruction indicating the operation button display object part that has been pressed is sent to the server computer SV. In the server computer SV based on the screen data stored in the storage portion via the script interpreter the business logic analyzes that the operation corresponding to the color setting button as the display object part indicated by the parts specification instruction is an operation for displaying on the display portion a display screen having an operation button for setting which color mode to carry out printing for example.

Following this in order to execute the analyzed job the business logic calls the API corresponding to that job and executes the API on the multifunction peripheral via the communications portion SS . However in a case where analysis of the jobs and services associated with the multiple display object parts is carried out at SS and the multiple jobs have been analyzed each API corresponding to these multiple jobs are called and each of the APIs is executed on the multifunction peripheral respectively via the communications portion . It should be noted that the processing of SS is not carried out in a case where jobs for the multifunction peripheral have not been analyzed at SS.

In the multifunction peripheral the API accesses to the controller in the firmware of the multifunction peripheral through the platform and the controller executes the job corresponding to the API F . For example in a case of the example described using the controller executes the execute scan operation and send file of scanned image data to PC . For example in the case of the example described using the controller and the web browser execute the operation for displaying on the display portion a display screen having an operation button for setting which color mode to carry out printing and for example a display screen provided with operation buttons display object parts for setting the color settings in detail is displayed on the display portion by the controller and the web browser as shown in based on the APIs and screen data sent from the server computer SV.

Further still in order to execute the service that has been analyzed at SS the business logic calls the API corresponding to that service and the API is executed via the communications portion on the external device that is set as the service execution target whose API was analyzed at SS SS . At the external device the API accesses to the control portion in the firmware of the external device through the interface and the control portion executes the service corresponding to the API.

For example in a case where the analyzed service is image processing of redeye removal processing for image data of the file received from the multifunction peripheral the business logic calls an API of redeye removal processing or the like as a control command for executing the redeye removal processing or the like on the external device. In a case where the API has been executed as the control command for the external device to execute redeye removal processing the control portion of the external device executes image processing of redeye removal processing for image data of the file received from the multifunction peripheral in accordance with the API.

However in a case where analysis of the jobs and services associated with the multiple display object parts is carried out at SS and the multiple services have been analyzed each API corresponding to these multiple services is called and each of the APIs is executed on the external device that is set as the service execution target respectively via the communications portion . It should be noted that the processing of SS is not carried out in a case where services for the external devices have not been analyzed at SS.

Next description is given of a second embodiment of an operational control system and image forming apparatus according to one embodiment of the present invention. is a diagram showing the second embodiment of an operational control system according to one embodiment of the present invention. It should be noted that description is omitted for configurations that are the same in the first embodiment. For example in the second embodiment the PC has the same configuration and same handling as in the first embodiment.

An operational control system according to the second embodiment is provided with a PC and a multifunction peripheral . In the operational control system the multifunction peripheral stores the screen data that has been generated at the PC and transmitted from the PC in a registration portion which is described later and when a display object part is specified by an operation based on the display screen by the operator during display of the display screen on the display portion the multifunction peripheral analyzes and executes the operation associated with the display object part that has been selected by the operator.

In a case of the second embodiment processes up to screen data generation processing by the screen data generation portion are carried out in the PC and the multifunction peripheral obtains from the PC the screen data that has been generated via the communications portion . However in the multifunction peripheral the registration portion obtains the screen data from the PC . The obtaining of the screen data from the PC is not limited to network communications such as the LAN or the like and the multifunction peripheral can obtain this from the PC by email or the multifunction peripheral can obtain the screen data and store it in the storage portion by an operator reading the screen data stored on a USB memory or the like by the PC at an unshown memory interface provided in the multifunction peripheral .

The multifunction peripheral has a controller control portion a storage portion a platform an extended application provided in a control unit web container and a web browser a display control portion and parts specification instruction receiving portion .

The extended application of the multifunction peripheral is constituted chiefly by a script interpreter a business logic and the registration portion .

The registration portion registers as display data of the display portion the screen data of the script file that has been sent from the communications portion of the PC or read out from the external memory and stores this in the storage portion .

It should be noted that the registration portion and the storage portion function as a display data obtaining portion.

The script interpreter analysis portion analyzes the content that is read in of the file of the script file which is the display screen data registered in the storage portion by the registration portion . The script interpreter carries out HTML conversion processing for displaying the display screens on the display portion and an expansion process to the business logic for executing actions associated with the display object parts of operation buttons and the like placed within the display screen. The script interpreter transfers the data on which the conversion process to HTML format was carried out for display to the business logic via an API.

The business logic transmits the display data that has undergone HTML conversion processing received from the script interpreter to the web browser . Furthermore the business logic controls the actions of the multifunction peripheral and the external devices operations of the multifunction peripheral and the external devices based on information information indicating the jobs of the multifunction peripheral and services of the external devices associated with the display object parts obtained from the aforementioned script interpreter .

That is in a same manner as the business logic of the server computer SV in the first embodiment when a display object part such as an operation button or the like displayed on the display screen which is displayed on the display portion by the web browser of the multifunction peripheral is specified the business logic obtains from the web browser the parts specification instruction of which display object part has been specified and analyzes the jobs and services that are set in the display object part indicated by the parts specification instruction based on information information obtained by analysis of the script files by the script interpreter information indicating jobs of the multifunction peripheral and services of the external devices associated with the display object parts which has been transferred from the script interpreter and calls the API corresponding to the analyzed job or service in order to execute the analyzed job or service. Analyzed jobs are transferred from the business logic to the controller . Analyzed services are sent from the business logic to the platform and transmitted from the platform to the external device.

The storage portion stores the aforementioned screen data functioning also as an operational control program an operational control program to cause operation as the controller programs of the extended application and programs of the web browser and the like. The CPU which is the central control portion of the multifunction peripheral functions as the controller the extended application and the web browser and the like by operating in accordance with the programs stored in the storage portion .

In a same manner as the processes of P to P in after screen data has been generated by the screen data generation portion the screen data generation portion transmits the generated screen data to multifunction peripheral using the communications portion screen data output portion P .

In the multifunction peripheral when the generated screen data is received by the registration portion F the registration portion registers the display screen data which is constituted by a script file as display data of the display portion and stores this in the storage portion F .

Next description is given of display processing by the display portion of display screens generated by the PC and reception processing of an instruction to execute operation from the operator at the multifunction peripheral in the operational control system according to the second embodiment. is a flowchart showing display processing by the display portion of display screens generated by the PC and reception processing of an instruction to execute operation from the operator at the multifunction peripheral in the operational control system according to the second embodiment.

As described earlier display data script files received from the PC are stored in the storage portion .

Here when a necessity arises to display a display screen on the display portion due to an operation or the like at the operation portion of the multifunction peripheral by the operator the script interpreter reads out the screen data script files which were received from the PC by the platform of the multifunction peripheral from the storage portion F .

The script interpreter analyzes the screen data that has been read out then carries out HTML conversion processing for displaying the display screens on the display portion and an expansion process to the business logic for executing the jobs and services associated with the display object parts placed within the display screens F .

Following this the business logic analyzes the data that has undergone the HTML processing obtained from the script interpreter so that it can be displayed on the display portion and transfers this to the web browser F . The web browser displays the received screen data on the display portion F .

When any of the display buttons display object parts displayed on the display portion is pressed yes at F by an operation or the like of the operator using the touch panel function during display of the display screen by the web browser the parts specification instruction indicated by the pressed display button display object part is sent from the web browser to the business logic of the extended application .

Here in a case where parts specification instructions have been set by the operator in regard to both a display button display object part associated with a job executable by the multifunction peripheral and a display button display object part associated with a service executable by an external device other than the multifunction peripheral which is set separately to this the web browser receives the parts specification instructions in regard to these display buttons display object parts respectively. In this case the web browser sends the parts specification instructions indicating the display buttons display object parts that have been pressed to the business logic of the extended application .

When the parts specification instructions are received the business logic analyzes F the jobs or services associated with the display buttons display object parts indicated by the parts specification instructions based on information data stored in the storage portion screen data of display screens including the display object parts indicated by the parts specification instructions which has been transferred from the script interpreter .

Following this in order to execute the analyzed job the business logic calls the API corresponding to that job and transfers that API to the controller F . However in a case where analysis of the jobs and services associated with the multiple display object parts is carried out at F and the multiple jobs have been analyzed each API corresponding to these multiple jobs is called and each of the APIs is transferred to the controller . However the processing of F is not carried out in a case where jobs to by executed by the multifunction peripheral have not been analyzed at F.

Further still in order to execute the service that has been analyzed at F the business logic calls the API corresponding to that service and sends the API from the platform to the external device that is set as the service execution target analyzed at F F . At the external device the API accesses to the control portion in the firmware of the external device through the interface and the control portion executes the operation corresponding to the API. That is the business logic and the platform constitute one example of an output portion. However in a case where analysis of the jobs and services associated with the multiple display object parts is carried out at F and the multiple services have been analyzed each API corresponding to these multiple services is called and each of the APIs is executed on the external device that is set as the service execution target analyzed at F.

However the processing of F is not carried out in a case where services for the external devices have not been analyzed at F.
