abstract: A remote power delivery system includes an electrically-conductive plate disposed adjacent to a sensor system of an underwater vehicle's hull. At least one toroidal coil is disposed between the plate and the face of the sensor system exposed to water. An AC voltage is applied to the plate so that a time-harmonic voltage is induced in each toroidal coil.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.

The present invention relates generally to remote power delivery systems and methods and more particularly to a remote power delivery system and method that supplies power to locations exterior to an underwater vehicle s hull.

Currently underwater vehicles have on hull sensor arrays connected to the inboard side of the underwater vehicles by means of large heavy expensive wiring harnesses. The sensors are embedded in a polymer material and are located several inches above the hull of the underwater vehicle. It would be desirable to deliver power to the sensor arrays without the use of large wiring harnesses in order to reduce costs and the overall weight of the system and to improve reliability.

To address this problem U.S. Pat. No. 7 170 821 discloses a method and apparatus for delivering power to a series of remote sensors in an on hull sensor grid for the purpose of biasing the sensors active circuitry. It requires no physical connection between the source of power and the sensor. It works by delivering electrical energy across the insulating gap that separates the sensor from the hull by means of a displacement current. In particular the method and device include a conducting layer interposed between inner and outer layers and a ground plane interposed between a bonding layer and the inner layer. An application of alternating current to the ground plane will activate the conducting layer and provide power to the sensors at a location of the outer layer. The inner layer acts as a capacitor and the ground plane further provides an electrical path back to the hull. However this approach requires the use of two conducting layers and electrical connection of all sensors to one of the conducting layers.

Accordingly it is an object of the present invention to provide a remote power delivery system that can deliver power to a location that is on the exterior of a ship s hull.

Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become more obvious hereinafter in the specification and drawings.

In accordance with the present invention a remote power delivery system includes an electrically conductive plate disposed adjacent to a sensor system of an underwater vehicle s hull where a face of the sensor system is maintained in water. An alternating current AC source for generating an AC voltage is coupled to the plate and hull. At least one toroidal coil is disposed between the plate and the face of the sensor system. When AC voltage is applied to the plate a time harmonic voltage is induced in each toroidal coil.

Referring now to the drawings and more particularly to a remote power delivery system in accordance with the present invention is incorporated in a sensor system typically found at the exterior of an underwater vehicle. In a portion of a hull of an underwater vehicle is referenced by numeral with A referencing an exterior region face of hull . The underwater vehicle could be manned or unmanned without departing from the scope of the present invention.

Coupled to exterior region A is a sensor system used to house devices requiring electrical power such as acoustic or other sensors. As is known in the art such sensor systems typically include one or more layers of polymer material s bonded to exterior region A by a bonding layer . Polymer material s are typically made from an elastomeric material that can also serve as a dielectric insulator. When hull is under water polymer material s will reside under water as illustrated.

In accordance with the present invention an electrically conductive material layer or plate is disposed between bonding layer and polymer material s . Plate should be made of metal such as aluminum copper silver or any other highly conductive material. Typically plate is approximately 1 millimeter thick. When hull is under water plate and water at the face of polymer material s can be thought of as plates of a capacitor since water is essentially at ground potential. Polymer material s are the dielectric of the capacitor formed by water and plate .

Disposed between plate and face A of polymer material s are one or more toroidal coils of wire . If polymer material s are arranged in layers coils could be disposed between such layers with the particular placement and orientation of coils being dictated by the particular application. If polymer material s are monolithic coils could be cast therein during the manufacturing process.

An alternating current AC source is coupled to plate and hull . AC source applies an AC voltage to plate . Since water will contact at least some portion of hull when under water water is effectively coupled to AC source such that the capacitor defined by water polymer material s and plate define a circuit element that is excited by AC source . When this capacitor is excited by an AC voltage a time harmonic electric field will be created in dielectric material s and can be defined as

According to the Maxwell equations a time harmonic circumflex over z directed electric field will give rise to a magnetic field that circulates around the lines of electric flux. Mathematically this can be written as

In accordance with Faraday s Law of induction a time varying magnetic field can produce a voltage. Under a quasi static approximation this voltage Vcan be written as

This equation indicates that a time harmonic voltage can be induced in a toroidal coil that is immersed in a time harmonic electric flux. The voltage transfer ratio of

The voltage generated in each coil can be tapped to supply one or more electrically powered devices. For example illustrates one coil with ends A and B of the coil being coupled to an electrical device disposed within the volumetric confines defined by coil . Coil is configured e.g. mean radius number of turns etc. to produce an induced AC voltage as described above to satisfy the power requirements of device . Device can include a rectifier not shown if device has DC operational requirements. The positioning of device within the confines of coil can be important depending on the nature of device . For example if device is an acoustic sensor placing the sensor within the confines of coil allows the combination of coil device to have rotational symmetry.

The derivation of Vdescribed above was based on the assumption that coil was parallel or approximately so to plate . This relationship is illustrated in where each coil has a central circular axis i.e. the axis circulating through the center of the windings defined by coil that lies in a plane referenced by dashed line C. For maximum coupling efficiency coils are positioned such that plane C is approximately parallel to plate as illustrated.

The advantages of the present invention are numerous. Electric power can be supplied to one or more devices that must be positioned on the exterior of an underwater vehicle s hull. The coil s symmetry is well suited to supplying power for an acoustic sensor that requires rotational symmetry in its installation configuration. No second conducting plate or ground bus is required as the system utilizes the seawater environment to form a grounded capacitor plate.

It will be understood that many additional changes in the details materials steps and arrangement of parts which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims.
