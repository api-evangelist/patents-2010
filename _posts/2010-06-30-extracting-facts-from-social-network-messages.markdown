title: Extracting facts from social network messages
abstract: Within a social network, users may submit various types of messages, such as personal messages to other users and status messages to be shared with all associated users. While these messages often relate to highly personal information such as opinions and personal emotions, such messages may also comprise one or more facts about a particular topic, such as a report of a weather condition in a particular location at a particular time. These facts may be identified in various messages, and may be stored in a fact store, such that when a user submits a query specifying a topic may receive from the fact store one or more facts that are responsive to the topic of the query. Additionally, user interfaces may be devised and provided to users submitting such messages, e.g., in order to reduce ambiguity and improve the reliable extraction of facts from messages.

Within the field of computing many scenarios involve aspects of social networking wherein users may establish associations representing relationships with other users and may share data of interest with all or some associated users. In this context a user may establish a social profile comprising data that identifies various aspects of the user to associated users such as demographic information a set of interests such as hobbies or professional skills and a set of resources that are interesting to the user. Users may consent to having some aspects of his or her social profile shared e.g. a user might generate a message such as a personal status a note about a particular topic or a message directed to another user that may initially be accessible only to users who are associated with the user but may permit an associated user to repost the message for access by all of the users associated with the associated user e.g. a friend of a user may be permitted to take the user s message and repost it to grant access to the friend s friends. In this manner data shared over a social network and in particular data comprising the social profile of a user may be propagated in select ways to others via the social network.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

Messages published within social networks often relate to highly personal trivial or ephemeral topics e.g. opinions reflections and emotions but may also include objective facts e.g. observations and discoveries. A user may publish a message about an experience on a trip such as Having a great time on vacation The weather is beautiful While this message primarily relates to the personal experiences of the individual it may also be viewed as a personal report of several facts such as the location of the individual at a particular time and the weather observed at that location.

The social network may be configured to in addition to receiving and exchanging these messages identify the facts expressed in each message and to collect the reported experiences and observations of the users in the messages. For example each fact may be associated with a topic such as a weather condition in a particular location and the messages may be evaluated to identify an indication of a topic and a fact associated with that topic. These collected facts may be stored in a fact store such as a database comprising a body of facts associated with a topic according to the users of the social network. These facts may then be utilized to answer queries of users of the social network regarding these topics in a convenient manner. The answers may also indicate a degree of reliability of the answer e.g. based on the reliability of the user generating the answer or the confidence in the unambiguity of the extracted fact from the update. Based on these and other techniques the collective knowledge and observations of the users of the social network may be aggregated into a queryable data set. Additionally the social network may be configured with additional features e.g. a user interface that promotes the contribution of facts in an unambiguous manner an anonymizing technique that deters the identification of the contributor of a fact and or a fact solicitation and reward system whereby the social network may accept requests from users regarding desired facts and may reward users of the social network who provide such facts.

To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects advantages and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.

The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident however that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.

Within the field of computing many scenarios involve a social network wherein users may generate a personal representation in the form of a social profile such as a set of personal descriptors of the user s identity academic and professional background and personal interests. Users may also form associations with other users of the social network where such associations may represent familial relationships friendships acquaintanceships academic and professional connections and shared interests. The user may also consent to share the contents of the social profile with the associated users either by affirmatively inviting an associated user to view a particular data item or by simply granting such other users access to the social profile and may view the social profiles of the associated users. The users of the social network may also communicate through the delivery of various types of messages such as private messages sent to one or more associated users or public messages that are shared with all of the associated users.

Within the social network a user may generate many types of messages . For example the second user may generate a personal message directed to the first user which may be delivered by the social network in various ways e.g. as a public posting of the message as a private message held in a queue such as an email box or as an instant message that is promptly delivered to the first user . The second user may also generate a personal status message that is viewable by all of the associated users who have associations with the user but that is not viewable by other users such as the fourth user . In this manner a user may specify limited control over the public distribution of the message .

Within the social network many types of such messages may be exchanged. These messages may include many types of information such as personal opinions emotions ideas and observations of the user e.g. I m having a great time on vacation and I love the nice weather here Conventional social networks are configured to store the messages and to deliver them to the recipients of the messages in various ways and may also perform limited evaluation of the messages e.g. by identifying one or more topics discussed in the message in order to select and present targeted advertisements that relate to such topics or by indexing the contents of the messages in order to permit rapid searching. These messages are often casual or ephemeral in nature e.g. a personal status message may only have value to the author of the status message as long as other users are demonstrating an interest in the message such as by viewing or commenting on the message and the user may not be interested in having the social network retain the message for a long duration. Therefore conventional social networks often handle the messages as trivial data and may dispose of messages after the perceived value of the message to the user has likely expired.

However while many messages exchanged in a social network may primarily have value only to the author of the message and some associated users such as users targeted by or mentioned in the message many of these messages may also contain some factual items that may be of more general interest. As a first example a user may post two messages reading I m having a great time on vacation and I love the nice weather here While these messages about the experiences of the user might be directly valuable only to associated users who are interested in the experiences of the user such as friends and family members certain facts may be extracted from these messages . For example the first message may include a geotag such as a combination of latitude and longitude coordinates that indicate where the user was located while generating the message thereby establishing the presence of the user in that location at the time the first message was authored. Similarly the second message may indicate that the weather nice at the time of the second message in this location presuming that the second message was generated around the same time as the first message and suggests that the user was located in the same place. The nice quality of the weather may be compared with information about what types of weather is considered nice among the users of the social network or even specifically what types of weather are considered nice by the user who generated the message in order to infer a possible weather report for the location.

As further illustrated in the exemplary scenario of the social network may be configured to deliver the messages according to the communications channels e.g. email messaging instant messaging or chat messaging and privacy parameters pertaining thereto. However the social network may also be configured to evaluate these messages in order to identify and extract one or more facts indicated in the content of the messages . As a first example the status message of the second user the weather here is nice may be difficult to interpret in isolation but the status message may be associated with a time indicating when the weather in the location of the second user was observed to be nice and a geotag such as a pair of latitude and longitude coordinates that indicates the location of the second user at the time of authoring the status message . The geotag might be compared with a geolocation database to identify the location referred to by the second user in the status message such as Paris and may therefore conclude that the weather in this location qualified as nice as of the time of the status message . Moreover the nice qualification may be mapped to a set of specific and inferred conditions about the location of the second user either based on a conventional usage of the term e.g. users typically consider nice weather to fall within the temperature range of 70 degrees to 79 degrees and with little or no cloud cover or based on the specific preferences of the user generating the message . In this manner the social network may infer that according to the status message of the second user the weather in Paris at a particular date and time was within a particular range of weather conditions. This inference may be evaluated as a topic e.g. the weather in Paris on a particular date and a fact e.g. qualitatively described as nice or predicted as having quantitative properties of temperature and cloud cover. As a second example the second personal message generated by the second user the art museum was closed today may not reveal significant facts in isolation. However the second message may be associated with a time indicating the date on which the art museum was closed and if the time of the second message is close to the time of the status message the geotag of the status message may also be attributed to the personal message to suggest the particular art museum mentioned in the second message e.g. possibly the Louvre. The information in this second message supplemented with the information from the status message may suggest a first topic e.g. the location of the second user at a particular time and a first fact e.g. Paris France and a second topic e.g. the status of an art museum in Paris France possibly the Louvre at a particular time and a second fact e.g. the art museum was closed. 

In this manner the social network may be configured to evaluate the messages generated by various users and to extract facts associated with various topics . These topics and facts may be stored in a fact store which may be queried about particular topics and facts associated therewith. For example a fourth user may submit to the social network one or more queries about particular topics e.g. a first query regarding the status of an art museum in Paris France at a particular time and a second query regarding the weather in Paris France at a particular time . The social network may apply these queries to the fact store and may retrieve any facts stored in the fact store that are related to the topics identified in the queries . For example based on the messages of the second user the fact store may store a topic and fact that are responsive to the first query and the social network may fulfill the first query by sending to the fourth user a first reply indicating that the art museum referenced in the first query was closed at the referenced time . Similarly the fact store may store a topic and fact that are responsive to the second query and the social network may fulfill the second query by sending to the fourth user a second reply indicating that the weather in Paris France at the referenced time was sunny and clear which may have been inferred from the description of the weather as nice in the status message of the second user . The social network may also utilize other features in fulfilling such queries e.g. because the fourth user does not have an association with the second user the social network may only fulfill the queries of the fourth user using topics and facts that are not personal to the second user or that are affirmatively anonymized whereas the associated users having an association with the second user may be permitted to submit queries pertaining to topics and facts that are personal to the second user . 

Still another embodiment involves a computer readable medium comprising processor executable instructions configured to apply the techniques presented herein. An exemplary computer readable medium that may be devised in these ways is illustrated in wherein the implementation comprises a computer readable medium e.g. a CD R DVD R or a platter of a hard disk drive on which is encoded computer readable data . This computer readable data in turn comprises a set of computer instructions configured to operate according to the principles set forth herein. In one such embodiment the processor executable instructions may be configured to perform a method of presenting facts extracted from messages generated by users within a social network such as the exemplary method of . In another such embodiment the processor executable instructions may be configured to implement a system for presenting facts extracted from messages generated by users within a social network such as the exemplary system of . Some embodiments of this computer readable medium may comprise a non transitory computer readable storage medium e.g. a hard disk drive an optical disc or a flash memory device that is configured to store processor executable instructions configured in this manner. Many such computer readable media may be devised by those of ordinary skill in the art that are configured to operate in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

The techniques discussed herein may be devised with variations in many aspects and some variations may present additional advantages and or reduce disadvantages with respect to other variations of these and other techniques. Moreover some variations may be implemented in combination and some combinations may feature additional advantages and or reduced disadvantages through synergistic cooperation. The variations may be incorporated in various embodiments e.g. the exemplary method of and the exemplary system of to confer individual and or synergistic advantages upon such embodiments.

A first aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the scenarios wherein these techniques may be utilized. As a first example these techniques may be used to extract facts from many types of social networks including genealogy social networks representing familial associations academic social networks representing academic associations such as classmates or student teacher relationships dating social networks representing romantic connections and gaming social networks representing teammate and opponent connections. As a second example of this first aspect these techniques may be applied to extract facts from many types of messages exchanged over the social network including textual messages images audio or video recordings and many types of data objects such as uniform resource identifiers URIs that reference web resources of interest to a user . Additionally these techniques may be utilized to examine messages exchanged over many types of communication channels within a social network such as instant messages and other chat messages that are promptly delivered messages that are enqueued such as resembling an email communication system and a news feed or bulletin board communication system. Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many such scenarios wherein the techniques presented herein may be advantageously implemented.

A second aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the architectures of various implementations. As a first example an embodiment of these techniques may operate within the social network e.g. as components integrated with the logic of the message receipt and delivery systems of the social network . Alternatively an embodiment of these techniques may operate outside of the social network e.g. as an external system that receives a feed of messages posted within the social network and that endeavors to extract facts therefrom. In one such embodiment a client machine operated by a user of the social network may include an embodiment of these techniques e.g. to create a factual database of the facts expressed in messages encountered by the user . As a second example of this second aspect the architectures of these techniques may vary in the number configuration and interaction of components. In a first such variation while the exemplary method of comprises an exemplary embodiment of these techniques other exemplary methods may also be devised e.g. facts might be extracted from various messages within the social network after receiving a query from a user about a topic associated with such facts . In a second such variation the components of the exemplary system in the exemplary scenario of may vary in number configuration and interoperation e.g. the fact store might be implemented as a portion of the message store that is configured to store messages and a system embodiment of these techniques may omit a separate fact store and may simply annotate the messages stored in the message store. Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many suitable architectures that may adequately implement the techniques presented herein.

A third aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the manner of identifying topics and facts in a message within the social network . As a first example the message may semantically evaluate each message using natural language parsing techniques and possibly utilizing linguistic concepts such as conversational context to understand the semantics of the message and to identify and extract any facts contained therein. Image and video based messages may similarly be evaluated through the application of machine vision techniques while speech recognition techniques may be applied to evaluate audio based messages . However these approaches may be computationally intensive and may not scale well to the volume of messages received over the social network .

As a second example of this third aspect some topics and facts may be identifiable based on the formatting of the information within the message . As a first variation a message may contain an instance of a date or time which may be well formatted in a detectable manner e.g. a date may often be written according to a standardized format such as dd mm yyyy or mm dd yyyy while a time may often be written according to a standardized format such as hh mm or hh mm ss and these formats may be specified in corresponding regular expressions that may be matched against a textual portion of a message . An embodiment may therefore be configured to identify within a message a time associated with a fact and to store the fact in the fact store associated with the topic and the time specified in the message . Additionally the embodiment may accept a query specifying a time e.g. the weather in Paris France at 6 00 on Sep. 1 2009 and while selecting facts from the fact store to fulfill the query may select only facts associated with the time specified in the query . As a second such variation a message may contain a reference to one or more locations such as a proper name e.g. Paris France or a recognizable nickname e.g. the City of Lights an address or a geotag such as a set of latitude and longitude coordinates. These references to locations may also be automatically identifiable and an embodiment may be configured to identify within a message a location associated with a fact and to store the fact in the fact store associated with the topic and the location specified in the message . Additionally the embodiment may accept a query specifying a location e.g. the weather in Paris France at 6 00 on Sep. 1 2009 and while selecting facts from the fact store to fulfill the query may select only facts associated with the location specified in the query . Many other types of automatically detectable facts may be identified and embodiments may be configured to detect many types of facts in this automated manner.

As a third example of this third aspect an embodiment of these techniques may utilize a fact schema wherein a set of topics is defined along with a set of facts that may be associated therewith. A user may while generating a message specify in the message at least one fact according to the fact schema e.g. including a particular identifier that is associated with a fact associated with a topic in the fact schema and the embodiment may detect this inclusion and thereby identify that the message relates to the fact . This example may be advantageous e.g. for standardizing the manner whereby topics and facts are specified in messages and for permitting such specification by users in an unambiguous manner.

As a fourth example of this third aspect topics and facts may be identified within messages in the social network according to less structured ways such as the detection of keywords associated with various topic and or facts . For example an embodiment may store a set of topical keywords associated with various topics and or a set of factual keywords associated with various facts and may identify the topics and facts within a message by detecting the presence of corresponding topical keywords and factual keywords. This example might be applied to the messages in the exemplary scenario of by specifying the term weather as a topical keyword and by specifying the terms hot warm sunny cloudy and rainy as factual keywords associated with the topical keyword weather. A message may be presumed to relate to this topic and these facts by including these keywords. This variation may be advantageous e.g. as a comparatively simple natural language processing technique that might extract facts from a large variety of messages without involving specialized formatting such as according to a fact schema and without consuming significant computational resources. However this variation might exhibit a large number of false negatives e.g. where the user misspells a keyword such as hot whether today or uses a synonym for a keyword such as scorching weather today and or false positives e.g. where the message includes keywords but may not suggest the corresponding fact to a human reader e.g. hot tea is great for this weather. 

As a fourth example of this third aspect an embodiment of these techniques may present to a user a user interface that promotes the association of topics and facts with messages . For example a user interface may allow a user of the social network to input the textual comment of a message but may then assist the user in selecting one or more topics relating to the message and also one or more facts associated with the selected topics . This user interface might utilize a fact schema e.g. as an internal representation of topics and facts that may populate controls within the user interface and or facilitate the storage of selected topics and facts . Alternatively or additionally the user interface might utilize various predictive techniques to predict the topics and facts that are associated with a message e.g. by detecting topical keywords and or factual keywords in the message and might use such predictions to suggest relevant topics and facts to the user in order to improve the efficiency of the user interface. The user interface might also inform the user regarding the submission of facts e.g. if the user submits a message including an uncommon topical keyword or an uncommon factual keyword e.g. a term that is occasionally but seldom used to identify a particular topic or fact the user interface may suggest to the user a common topical keyword or a common factual keyword that are used by other users with greater frequency or perhaps with less ambiguity to refer to the same topic or fact .

A fifth example of this third aspect relates to the possibility of unreliability in the extraction of a fact from a message of a user . Many factors may render the extraction of the fact from the message unreliable. For example the message may not have been intended as factual but fictional or satirical the user may have intended the message to report a fact be mistaken or untruthful about the fact or the parsing of the message may be inaccurate due to typographical errors ambiguity lack of context or imperfect natural language evaluation techniques. However the reliability of the fact may increase in view of a multitude of reports of the fact in many messages by many users . Therefore rather than recording a fact in the fact store based on one message written by one user an embodiment of these techniques may be configured to identify a fact and record the fact in the fact store only after receiving a message set comprising at least two messages submitted within the social network by different users that each include the fact . For example an embodiment may track a predicted confidence in a fact according to the number variety and unambiguity of messages reporting the fact submitted by a diverse set of users and may record the fact in the fact store only upon transcending a specified confidence threshold. This example may also present an added advantage of anonymizing the fact through the aggregation of the fact from many sources.

A further variation of this fifth example of this third aspect may resolve contradictions among facts reported by various users . For example a first user may submit a first message indicating a first fact about a particular topic and a second user may submit a second message indicating a second fact about the same topic that contradicts the first fact e.g. contradictory reports that the weather condition in a particular area at a particular time of day is hot and cold. Such contradictions may arise e.g. through errors in extracting the fact from one or more messages from differences of opinion among the users from limitations in a fact schema e.g. a conflation of a single weather report for a location from several messages reported in a region having localized weather variations or an effort by a user or even a potentially large group of users to plant false or inaccurate information in the fact store . In these cases an embodiment of these techniques may be configured to upon detecting a contradiction among two or more facts reported on a particular topic in the messages of a message set select a particular fact to be stored in the fact store and discard the contradictory facts . This selection may be based on many factors such as the confidence in the extraction of the respective facts from the messages a consensus among the users the plausibility of respective facts and the past reliability of previously reported facts by the users involved in the contradictory facts . An embodiment may also seek verification e.g. by asking other users of the social network possibly selected at random or among a pool of reliable users to verify a fact or to select among the contradictory facts or by seeking independent verification from data sources outside of the social network . In this manner the embodiment may seek to reduce contradictions among the facts stored in the fact store and to promote the reliability of the information contained therein. Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many ways of extracting facts from messages submitted by various users of the social network while implementing the techniques presented herein.

A fourth aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the manner of presenting the facts in response to various queries received from users of the social network . As a first example a query may be submitted by a user regarding a particular topic e.g. what was the weather condition in Paris France on Sep. 10 2010 with which may be associated a fact in the fact store and the fact may simply be presented to the user . The presentation of the fact might also identify the user who submitted the fact and the user may even be permitted to request in the query facts specified by particular users such as the set of associated users who have an association with the user submitting the query . Alternatively an embodiment of these techniques may endeavor to anonymize the fact and to present to the user an anonymized fact based on the fact stored in the fact store .

As a second example of this fourth aspect the presentation of facts may be presented in other ways than simply a single reported fact . As a first variation of this second example a query may request facts regarding the weather conditions in a particular location over a particular period. An embodiment may select from the fact store several facts comprising weather reports in this location at several times within the specified period and may generate and present in response to the query a graphical representation of weather trends during this period such as temperature fluctuations. 

A fifth aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to soliciting users of the social network to submit messages containing one or more desired facts. As a first scenario the social network may identify a desired fact that is missing in the fact store such as a fact that is missing from a set of facts that otherwise comprise a complete trend line. As a second scenario a user may submit a query requesting a fact that is not present in the fact store . In such scenarios an embodiment of these techniques may be configured to send to one or more users of the social network a solicitation for a message including the desired fact. As a first such variation the social network may be able to identify one or more particular users within the social network who may know the desired fact e.g. if the desired fact comprises a weather condition in a particular location at a particular time the social network may identify one or more users who may be or may have been present in that location at that time and may specifically send the solicitation to these particular users . As a second such variation the social network may include in the solicitation an offer for a reward for submitting the fact e.g. an acknowledgment of the user as the reporter of the desired fact a micropayment reward an award of points in a point system or an offer to receive and broadcast a similar query from the user who first provides the desired fact. This reward may be selected by the social network e.g. a standard point value or micropayment or a graded reward system based on the promptness detail or reliability of the submission of the desired fact or may be specified by the user submitting the query for the desired fact e.g. as a bidding system where users may specify higher rewards for messages that are submitted more promptly or with more detail or reliability. In either case the embodiment may be configured to upon receiving from a user of the social network a message including the desired fact deliver the specified reward to the user .
