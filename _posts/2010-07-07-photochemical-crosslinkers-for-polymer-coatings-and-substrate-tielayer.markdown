No. 7 772 393 entitled Photochemical Crosslinkers for Polymer Coatings and Substrate Tie Layer filed Jun. 12 2006 and claims benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119 e to U.S. Ser. Nos. 60 690 018 entitled Photochemical Crosslinkers for Polymer Coatings and Substrate Tie Layer filed Jun. 13 2005 60 709 330 entitled Photochemical Crosslinkers for Polymer Coatings and Substrate Tie Layer filed Aug. 18 2005 and 60 804 222 entitled Photochemical Crosslinkers for Polymer Coatings and Substrate Tie Layer filed Jun. 8 2006 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

This invention was made with government support under Grant No. 7R44HL066933 03 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention.

The invention relates generally to cross linking agents that are generally hydrophilic and provide photoactivatable groups. The compounds are useful as surface coating agents alone or in combination with other target molecules such as polymers biomolecules and the like.

There exist many ways to coat adhere adsorb modify etc. a surface with a material such that the material changes the characteristics of the surface. For example suitable coatings can be prepared that when applied to a given surface render the surface hydrophobic. In other instances the coating may provide enhanced ability to bind with a target molecule such as a protein.

In particular there are known crosslinking materials that include a latent reactive group such as a photoactivatable group. The crosslinking material has in general at least two photoactivatable groups such that one group can be activated and attached to the surface of the substrate. The remaining latent group can then later be or simultaneously with the surface attachment activated to react with a target molecule such as a polymer or a biomolecule.

There are generally three types of crosslinking materials with photoactivatable groups. One type is hydrophobic in nature making it difficult to dissolve in an aqueous systems. The second type is hydrophilic but includes quaternary charged moieties. Quaternary compounds tend to promote non specific binding of non target molecules which is often not a desired result. A third type of crosslinking material with photoactivatable groups includes negatively charged groups such as carboxylic acids sulfonic acids phosphoric acids and the like. Although these materials are considered to be hydrophilic they also increase non specific binding interactions with non targeted molecules by the crosslinking material.

Therefore a need exists for a crosslinking material that includes photoactivatable groups that is hydrophilic in nature and does not promote non specific binding interactions with non target molecules.

The present invention surprisingly provides unique crosslinking molecule families that include photoactivatable groups. The crosslinkers are hydrophilic in nature and do not promote non specific binding interactions with non target molecules.

 Leaving group is a group that is displaced during a reaction by a nucleophilic reagent. Suitable leaving groups include S O Me SMe or halo e.g. F Cl Br I .

 Linking group is a group that serves as an intermediate locus between two or more end groups. The nature of the linking group can vary widely and can include virtually any combination of atoms or groups useful for spacing one molecular moiety from another. For example the linker may be an acyclic hydrocarbon bridge e.g a saturated or unsaturated alkyleno such as methano ethano etheno propano prop 1 eno butano but 1 eno but 2 eno buta 1 3 dieno and the like a monocyclic or polycyclic hydrocarbon bridge e.g. 1 2 benzeno 2 3 naphthaleno and the like a simple acyclic heteroatomic or heteroalkyldiyl bridge e.g. O S S O NH PH C O C O NH S O S O S O NH S O NH O CH CH O CH O CH CH CH and the like a monocyclic or polycyclic heteroaryl bridge e.g. 3 4 furano pyridino thiopheno piperidino piperazino pyrazidino pyrrolidino and the like or combinations of such bridges.

 Protecting group is a group that is appended to for example a hydroxyl oxygen in place of a labile hydrogen atom. Suitable hydroxyl protecting group s include esters acetate ethylacetate ethers methyl ethyl ethoxylated derivatives ethylene glycol propylene glycol and the like that can be removed under either acidic or basic conditions so that the protecting group is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom. Guidance for selecting appropriate protecting groups as well as synthetic strategies for their attachment and removal may be found for example in Greene Wuts 3d Edition John Wiley Sons Inc. New York 1999 and the references cited therein hereinafter Greene Wuts .

The compounds of the invention that can be used as coating agents include one or more moieties that render the molecule hydrophilic in nature. In certain aspects the hydrophilic portion is a hydroxyl or protected hydroxyl group. Alternatively the molecule can include amine functionality and or an alkoxy group or polyalkyoxy group. The type and number of hydrophilic groups in a coating agent are sufficient to provide the agent with a water solubility at room temperature and optimal pH of at least about 0.1 mg ml in particular at least about 0.5 mg ml and more particularly at least about 1 mg ml. Given the nature of the surface coating process coating agent solubility levels of at least about 0.1 mg ml are generally adequate for providing useful coatings of target molecules e.g. polymer layers on surfaces.

The compositions of the present application can thus be contrasted with other coating agents in the art which are typically considered to be insoluble in water e.g. having a comparable water solubility in the range of about 0.1 mg ml or less and more often about 0.01 mg ml or less . For this reason conventional coating agents are typically provided and used in solvent systems in which water is either absent or is provided as a minor e.g. less than about 50 by volume component.

Alternatively the compositions of the invention can be solubilized in water alcohol solutions or in alcohols such as isopropanol butanol methanol ethanol cellosolves glycols and the like.

Examples of moieties that help to provide hydrophilicity to the compositions of the invention are as described above and include hydroxyl groups polyhydric groups alkoxy groups polyoxyalkylenes amines amides and esters.

Photoreactive species are as described herein and are sufficiently stable to be stored under conditions in which they retain such properties. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 002 582 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Latent reactive groups can be chosen that are responsive to various portions of the electromagnetic spectrum with those responsive to ultraviolet and visible portions of the spectrum referred to herein as photoreactive in particular.

Photoreactive species respond to external stimuli and undergo active specie generation with the formation of a covalent bond to an adjacent chemical structure e.g. as provided by the same or a different molecule. Photoreactive species are those groups of atoms in a molecule that retain their covalent bonds during storage but upon activation by an external energy source form covalent bonds with other molecules.

Photoreactive species generate active species such as free radicals and particularly nitrenes carbenes and excited states of ketones upon absorption of electromagnetic energy. Photoreactive species can be chosen to be responsive to various portions of the electromagnetic spectrum and photoreactive species that are responsive to e.g. ultraviolet and visible portions of the spectrum are referred to as a photochemical group or photogroup. 

The use of photoreactive species in the form of photoreactive aryl ketones are useful such as acetophenone benzophenone anthraquinone anthrone and anthrone like heterocycles i.e. heterocyclic analogs of anthrone such as those having N O or S in the 10 position or their substituted e.g. ring substituted derivatives. Examples of aryl ketones include heterocyclic derivatives of anthrone including acridone xanthone and thioxanthone and their ring substituted derivatives. In particular thioxanthone and its derivatives having excitation energies greater than about 360 nm are useful.

The functional groups of such ketones are preferred since they are readily capable of undergoing an activation inactivation reactivation cycle. Benzophenone is a photoreactive moiety since it is capable of photochemical excitation with the initial formation of an excited singlet state that undergoes intersystem crossing to the triplet state. The excited triplet state can insert into carbon hydrogen bonds by abstraction of a hydrogen atom from a support surface for example thus creating a radical pair. Subsequent collapse of the radical pair leads to formation of a new carbon carbon bond. If a reactive bond e.g. carbon hydrogen is not available for bonding the ultraviolet light induced excitation of the benzophenone group is reversible and the molecule returns to ground state energy level upon removal of the energy source. Photoactivatible aryl ketones such as benzophenone and acetophenone are of particular importance inasmuch as these groups are subject to multiple reactivation in water and hence provide increased coating efficiency.

The compositions of the invention can be applied to a surface of interest in any suitable manner. For example the composition can be applied by dip coating or by dispersing the compound on the surface for example by spray coating . Suitable methods of application include application in solution dipping spray coating knife coating and roller coating. In one aspect the compound is applied to the surface via spray coating as this application method provides increased density of the compound on the support surface thereby improving durability.

Linking agents can be used in any suitable manner including by the simultaneous or sequential attachment of a chemical compound to a surface. Linking agents of the present invention can be used to modify any suitable surface. Where the latent reactive group of the agent is a photoreactive group of the preferred type it is particularly preferred that the surface provide abstractable hydrogen atoms suitable for covalent bonding with the activated group.

Plastics such as polyolefins polystyrenes poly methyl methacrylates polyacrylonitriles poly vinylacetates poly vinyl alcohols chlorine containing polymers such as poly vinyl chloride polyoxymethylenes polycarbonates polyamides polyimides polyurethanes phenolics amino epoxy resins polyesters silicones cellulose based plastics and rubber like plastics can all be used as supports providing surfaces that can be modified as described herein. See generally Plastics pp. 462 464 in Concise Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Engineering Kroschwitz ed. John Wiley and Sons 1990 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. In addition supports such as those formed of pyrolytic carbon parylene coated surfaces and silylated surfaces of glass ceramic or metal are suitable for surface modification.

The method of the present invention involves the attachment of a target molecule to a support surface by use of the compounds of the invention. For example a compound of the invention is provided having two or more photoactivatable groups in the presence of a support surface. A portion of the photoactivatable groups are activated and covalently bonded to the surface. A portion of the photoactivatable groups are allowed to revert to their inactive state and are later reactivated in order to later bind a target molecule in order to attach the target molecule to the surface.

The steps of the method can be performed in any suitable order. For example a multifunctional compound as described herein can be physically absorbed or adsorbed to a suitable support surface by hydrophobic interactions. Upon illumination a portion of the photoreactive groups e.g. benzophenone groups undergo covalent bond formation at the support surface by the aforementioned mechanism. With the absence of abstractable hydrogens in the proximity of the remaining unbonded photoreactive group s and removal of the illumination source the excited state benzophenone returns to ground state energy. These remaining groups are then capable of being reactivated when the target molecule intended for immobilization is present and when the treated surface is exposed to another round of illumination. This method can be described as a two step approach where the photoreactive reagent is applied in the first step to create the latent reactive surface and in the second step the target molecule is added for attachment to the activated surface.

Alternatively the method described as a one step method provides that the compound of the present invention is mixed in solution together with the target molecule to form a composition. The resultant composition is used to surface modify materials in a single illumination step. In this case illumination triggers not only covalent bond formation of the latent photoreactive group with the material surface but also simultaneously triggers covalent bond formation with adjacent target molecules residing on the surface.

In an alternative embodiment the composition and the target molecule can be combined together in a one step process simultaneously with illumination.

In another alternative method a compound of the invention is used to pretreat a substrate surface prior to the application and bonding of molecules that have themselves been functionalized with latent reactive groups. This method is useful in situations where a particularly difficult substrate requires maximal coating durability. In this manner the number of covalent bonds formed between the substrate surface and the target molecule derivatized with latent reactive groups can typically be increased as compared to surface modification with a desired latent reactive group containing target molecule alone.

Suitable target molecules for use in the present invention for attachment to a support surface encompass a diverse group of substances. Target molecules can be used in either an underivatized form or previously derivatized. Moreover target molecules can be immobilized singly or in combination with other types of target molecules.

Target molecules can be immobilized to the surface either after e.g. sequentially the surface has been primed with linking agent. Alternatively however target molecules are immobilized during e.g. simultaneously with attachment of the present linking agent to the surface.

Typically target molecules are selected so as to confer particular desired properties to the surface and or to the device or article bearing the surface. Examples of suitable target molecules and the surface properties they are typically used to provide is represented by the following nonlimiting list 

In one embodiment the compounds of the invention can be applied to a catheter to provide a lubricious coating.

Medical articles that can be fabricated from or coated or treated with the compounds of the invention include but are not limited to catheters including urinary catheters and vascular catheters e.g. peripheral and central vascular catheters wound drainage tubes arterial grafts soft tissue patches gloves shunts stents tracheal catheters wound dressings sutures guide wires and prosthetic devices e.g. heart valves and LVADs . Vascular catheters which can be prepared according to the present invention include but are not limited to single and multiple lumen central venous catheters peripherally inserted central venous catheters emergency infusion catheters percutaneous sheath introducer systems thermodilution catheters including the hubs and ports of such vascular catheters leads to electronic devices such as pacemakers defibrillators artificial hearts and implanted biosensors.

The present invention provides to lubricious compositions that include one or more hydrophilic polymer s such as those listed throughout the specification i.e. polyvinylpyrrolidone polyacrylamide hyaluronic acid and or chitosan and one or more of the crosslinkers described herein.

In yet another aspect the present invention pertains to reaction products formed between one or more hydrophilic polymer s i.e. polyvinylpyrrolidone and the crosslinkers described herein. The reaction product can be a coating that can advantageously be used to coat catheters and medical devices providing a surface that is lubricious and remains moist.

The combination of one or more crosslinkers described herein and one or more hydrophilic polymer s such as polyvinylpyrrolidone can be combined to form a coating mixture. This mixture can be subjected to photoactivation. The activation can be performed on various surfaces and in particular on one or more surfaces of a catheter.

The hydrophilic polymer s that can be combined with one or more of crosslinkers of the invention can have a broad range of molecular weights. Advantageously hydrophilic polymers such as PVP can be selected that include both high molecular weight components as well as low molecular weight components. For example BASF provides several different PVPs including K30 K90 K12 K25 and K17. The number indicates MW in 1000s. Ranges of formulations were prepared from 50 50 K90 K30 to 90 10 K90 K30 with the higher the K90 the longer the dry time of the coating. For example PVP s can be formulated from available molecular weight ranges that include 75 high molecular weight PVP 90K and 

In another embodiment the compounds of the invention can be applied to a microscope slide or chip for biomolecule immobilization.

Compounds encompassed by the present invention can be prepared by selection of an appropriate aryl group with a photoactivatable group and at least one group that can either act as a nucleophilic site or can be acted upon in a nucleophilic displacement reaction with a linking agent L having at least two opposing groups either a leaving group s or a nucleophilic group s . General synthetic schemes detailed below demonstrate two approaches suitable to prepare compounds of the invention.

Suitable leaving groups or groups susceptible to nucleophilic attack include esters ethers epoxides halides isocyanates isothiocyanates sulfonyl chlorides anhydrides carboxylic acid halides carboxylic acid esters and aldehydes.

Resultant functional moieties from the reaction between the nucleophilic group and leaving or condensation group include for example esters ethers carbamates thiocarbamates sulfones amides ureas thiourea amines sulfonamides imines that can be further reduced with a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride to an amine etc.

Suitable reaction conditions for such condensations or nucleophilic displacements are known in the art. For example hydroxyl containing moieties can be condensed with a carboxylic acid under dehydrating conditions refluxing toluene acid catalyst Dean Stark trap to form esters. Reactive halides can be displaced by hydroxyl groups under basic conditions. An isocyanate reacts with a hydroxyl group with heat to form carbamates. Likewise an isothiocyanates reacts with a hydroxyl group to form a thiocarbamate. Under deprotonation conditions a hydroxide ion reacts with an epoxide to form an ether linkage and forming a new hydroxyl group. Reaction between a hydroxyl and a sulfonyl chloride forms a sulfone. Reaction between a hydroxyl and an anhydride will form a ester with a carboxylic acid portion as well. Reaction between a hydroxyl group and an ester will also form an ester with the removal of a corresponding displaced alcohol generally under conditions that drive off the displaced alcohol.

Much like the reactions with hydroxyl groups amines serve in similar manner. For example an amine can react with an activated carboxylic acid for form an amide. Activation of a carboxylic acid can be facilitated by various methods in the art including for example use of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide DCC that generates urea as a side product. An isocyanate reacts with an amine to form a urea and an isothiocyanate reacts with an amine to form a thiourea.

Reaction between an amine and an epoxide will form an amine with an appended hydroxyl group from the nucleophilic displacement of the epoxide ring. Reaction between an amine and a sulfonyl chloride will form a sulfonamide. Reaction between an anhydride and an amine will afford an amide with a carboxylic portion attached to the product. Reaction between an aldehyde and an amine will form an imine which can be further reduced to an amine. Reaction between a carboxylic acid halide and an amine will form an amide as well as the reaction between a carboxylic ester and amine. Lastly melamine type compounds can react with an amine to form amine linkages.

Reaction conditions to form the compounds of the invention are known in the art. For example suitable reaction conditions are described in March s Advanced Organic Chemistry Reactions Mechanisms and Structure 5th Edition John Wiley Sons Michael B. Smith Jerry March Fieser and Fieser s Reagents for Organic Synthesis John Wiley Sons NY Vogel s Textbook of Practical Organic Chemistry Fifth Edition by A. I. Vogel B. S. Furniss A. J. Hannaford P. W. G. Smith and A. R. Tatchell Longman Scientific and Technical Longman Group UK and Advanced Organic Chemistry parts A and B Third Edition F. A. Carey R. S. Sundberg Plenum Press NY 1990 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

It should also be understood that each Y independently can be different. Therefore it is possible to have reaction products that include an ether linkage as well as an ester linkage to the carbonyl containing photoactivatable group.

An exemplary non limiting reaction is depicted in Scheme III in which a hydroxyl group undergoes nucleophilic addition to an ester or acid halide or can undergo a condensation reaction between the hydroxyl group and a carboxylic acid.

The invention will be further described with reference to the following non limiting Examples. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that many changes can be made in the embodiments described without departing from the scope of the present invention. Thus the scope of the present invention should not be limited to the embodiments described in this application but only by embodiments described by the language of the claims and the equivalents of those embodiments. Unless otherwise indicated all percentages are by weight.

1.2 g 4 mmol of triglycidyl isocyanurate Aldrich Chemicals Milwaukee Wis. and 2.4 g 12 mmol of 4 hydroxybenzophenone Aldrich Chemicals Milwaukee Wis. were mixed in a 50 ml round bottom flask containing a magnetic stir bar. The flask was flushed with argon for 10 min and heated to 130 C. in an oil bath. Once the reaction mixture melted 6 mg 0.02 mmol of triphenylphosphine Aldrich Chemicals Milwaukee Wis. was added. The mixture was stirred for another 2 minutes under argon and cooled to room temperature. The reaction residue was dissolved in 30 ml chloroform then washed with 4N NaOH 30 ml 3 and deionized water 30 ml 3 . The organic layer was dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated to dryness on the under reduced pressure. The product was purified by column chromatography silica gel 230 400 mesh Whatman Inc. using ethyl acetate as eluent R 4.5 . The fractions containing the pure product were combined and concentrated under reduced pressure and a white powder was obtained after drying under vacuum yield 70 .

The crosslinker is soluble in most common solvents including chloroform methylene chloride acetone ethyl acetate isopropanol etc. H NMR CDCl confirmed the structure of the product. The peaks at d 7.78 ppm m 12H 7.46 ppm m 9H 6.98 ppm m 6H were the typical signals from 4 substituted benzophenone. The peak at d 4.35 ppm m 6H was assigned to the protons of methylene connected to phenoxy group. The peak at d 4.13 ppm m 9H was a combination of 6 protons of 3 methylene groups connected to nitrogen atom and 3 protons from 3 methine groups. The peak at d 3.00 ppm s 3H corresponded to hydroxyl groups.

A photoreactive poly caprolactone PCL film was prepared by incorporating the crosslinker in a film casting polymer solution. A solution containing 20 mg ml PCL Aldrich Chemicals Milwaukee Wis. and 0.4 mg ml triazine crosslinker as prepared in Example 1 was cast onto a glass slide. 10 l of 50 mg ml poly vinylpyrrolidone PVP 30K Kollidon K30 BASF N.J. in isopropanol solution was added onto the film. After complete evaporation of the isopropanol the film was illuminated under UV for 20 minutes UV Crosslinker UVP CL 1000 Upland Calif. 254 nm light 120 000 J cm . The coated film was incubated in deionized water on a shaker for 3 hours to remove unbound PVP. A homogeneous PVP coating could be seen on the PCL film by staining with a solution of Congo Red 0.5 w v aqueous solution indicating a uniform distribution of crosslinker on the film surface. A PCL film without triazine crosslinker added showed no staining indicating all unbound PVP was removed by the rinse.

2.26 g 4 hydroxybenzophenone Aldrich Chemicals Milwaukee Wis. was dissolved in 50 ml of acetone and 0.532 ml of glycerol triglycidyl ether Polysciences Warrington Pa. and 3.3 g potassium carbonate Aldrich Chemicals Milwaukee Wis. were added to the solution. The reaction mixture was heated to reflux over 24 hours. After 24 hours of heating thin layer chromatography TLC showed consumption of the glycerol starting material eluent 20 1 Chloroform methanol and the emergence of three uv active spots. The acetone was removed by rotary evaporation and the residue was dissolved in chloroform and filtered. The resulting chloroform solution was washed three times with 4N NaOH aqueous solution once with deionized water then twice with 1N HCl aqueous solution and three times again with deionized water. The chloroform solution was dried over magnesium sulfate filtered and the solvent removed by rotary evaporation. The resulting oil was washed three times with diethyl ether and dried. This treatment removed all 4 hydroxybenzophenone starting material with TLC revealing the same three uv active spots. These three products presumably correspond to single double and triple substitution of benzophenone on the glycerol compound.

A coating solution was made up from the crude glycol linker product isolated in Example 3 0.5 mg ml glycol in isopropanol with 50 mg ml polyvinylpyrrolidone Kollidon K30 BASF N.J. . 100 l of the coating solution was applied to PVC coverslips Fisher Scientific Pittsburgh Pa. and allowed to dry overnight. All pieces were illuminated for a set time in a uv crosslinker UVP CL 1000 Upland Calif. 254 nm light 120 000 J cm from 0 to 10 minutes. Pieces were then rinsed for 30 minutes in deionized water with gentle agitation. The static contact angle with water was taken on a goniometer MicroVu 400 Santa Ana Calif. three 3 l drops of water were measured three times apiece. Contact angles are shown below.

A coating solution was made up from the crude glycol linker product isolated in Example 3 2.0 mg ml glycol in 90 10 isopropanol acetone with 50 mg ml polyvinylpyrrolidone Kollidon K30 BASF N.J. . 500 l of the coating solution was applied to PVC coverslips Fisher Scientific Pittsburgh Pa. and allowed to dry overnight. Sample pieces were illuminated for 0 1 2 or 5 minutes in a uv crosslinker UVP CL 1000 Upland Calif. 254 nm light 120 000 J cm . Pieces were then rinsed for 30 minutes in deionized water with gentle agitation. After rinsing the pieces were stained with a solution of 3.5 mg ml Congo Red dye in deionized water by dipping in the solution for 30 seconds then rinsing in deionized water. Congo Red stains the PVP giving evidence of coated samples. Pieces illuminated for five minutes showed bright red stains indicating PVP while 0 1 and 2 minutes showed little or no red color.

A coating solution of purified triazine crosslinker isolated in Example 1 was made by adding 44 mg of crosslinker to 1 ml of acetone diluted with 19 ml of isopropanol then adding 1000 mg of poly vinylpyrrolidone PVP Kollidon K30 BASF N.J. . The resulting solution was thoroughly mixed on an orbital shaker for four hours. 18 samples were prepared by adding 100 200 or 500 l of coating solution onto PVC Coverslips Fisher Scientific Pittsburgh Pa. n 6 for each condition then air drying. The sample pieces were illuminated for five minutes in a uv chamber UVP CL 1000 Upland Calif. 254 nm light 120 000 J cm then rinsed for four hours in deionized water with gentle agitation. 4 pieces of each variable were then stained with Congo red dye to determine the presence of PVP. For each coating condition two of the four stained pieces were then rubbed with a wet glove to determine durability of the coating to simple rubbing. The results are shown in the following table. The remaining two unstained sample pieces for each coating condition were then assessed for static contact angle by threefold measurement of three 3 l drops of water on a goniometer MicroVu 400 Santa Ana Calif. . Results included in the following table show that after rinsing the top monolayer of each surface is hydrophilic and presumably contains PVP.

Three coating solutions were made each with 12 mg linker example 1 3 ml of isopropanol and 3 ml of 100 mg ml polymer solution in isopropanol where the polymer solutions were composed of K30 polyvinylpyrrolidone MW 30 000 Kollidon 30 BASF K90 polyvinylpyrrolidone MW 90 000 Kollidon 90 BASF and 1 1 K30 K90.

The pieces were tested with a commercial friction tester Harland Medical FTS 5000 Eden Prairie Minn. for lubricity and dry time.

In a lubricity test the pieces were hydrated for 2 minutes with water then silicone pads compressed the tubing while immersed in water as the tubing was pulled upward at 1.0 cm sec for 6.0 cm. The clamps were then released and the tubing moved freely downward 6.0 cm at 2.0 cm sec. This cycle was repeated fifteen times. The average friction force required to pull the coated tubing through the silicone pads with 300 g of force on them was 5.6 g. The average friction force to pull uncoated tubing through the silicone pads exceeds 250 g. No significant change was seen in the friction test throughout the fifteen cycles.

In a dry test the pieces were hydrated for 2 minutes with water followed by 4 minutes of air drying at room temperature.
