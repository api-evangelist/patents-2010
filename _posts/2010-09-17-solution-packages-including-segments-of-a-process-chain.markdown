Some known enterprise software packages include numerous features that are intended to meet the needs of a variety of users. In some computer systems these known enterprise software packages may include at least some features and or upgrades to these features that can needlessly consume computing resources and or that are dispersed throughout portions of the enterprise software packages. In some instances the features that are available within the enterprise software package may not even meet the specific needs of a user of the computer system. In addition the features of the enterprise software package may cause inconveniences during initial installation and or upgrading of the enterprise software package that may not be desirable to some users. Thus a need exists for systems methods and apparatus to address the shortfalls of present technology and to provide other new and innovative features.

In one general aspect a computer system can include instructions stored on a non transitory computer readable storage medium. The computer system can include an existing process chain module configured to receive a plurality of segment definitions representing a plurality of existing segments defining an existing process chain implemented in a target system. The computer system can include a proposed process chain module configured to select based on the plurality of segment definitions a first proposed process chain including a first proposed segment corresponding with an existing segment from the plurality of existing segments and including a second proposed segment different from each existing segment from the plurality of existing segments and configured to select based on the plurality of segment definitions a second proposed process chain including a first proposed segment corresponding with the existing segment from the plurality of existing segments and including a second proposed segment different from each existing segment from the plurality of existing segments. The computer system can include an operational relationship module configured to define an option for an operational relationship between the existing segment from the plurality of existing segments and the second proposed segment of the first proposed process chain and configured to define a prerequisite for an operational relationship between the existing segment from the plurality of existing segments and the second proposed segment of the second proposed process chain.

In another general aspect a non transitory computer readable storage medium storing code representing instructions that when executed are configured to cause a processor to perform a process. The code can include code to receive a plurality of segment definitions representing a plurality of existing segments defining an existing process chain implemented in a target system. The code can include code to select based on the plurality of segment definitions a first proposed process chain including a first proposed segment corresponding with an existing segment from the plurality of existing segments and including a second proposed segment different from each existing segment from the plurality of existing segments and code to select based on the plurality of segment definitions a second proposed process chain including a first proposed segment corresponding with the existing segment from the plurality of existing segments and including a second proposed segment different from each existing segment from the plurality of existing segments. The code can also include code to define an option for an operational relationship between the existing segment from the plurality of existing segments and the second proposed segment of the first proposed process chain and code to define a prerequisite for an operational relationship between the existing segment from the plurality of existing segments and the second proposed segment of the second proposed process chain.

In yet another general aspect a method can include executing instructions recorded on a non transitory computer readable storage media using at least one processor. The method can also include receiving a plurality of segment definitions representing a plurality of existing segments defining an existing process chain implemented in a target system. The method can include selecting based on the plurality of segment definitions a first proposed process chain including a first proposed segment corresponding with an existing segment from the plurality of existing segments and including a second proposed segment different from each existing segment from the plurality of existing segments and the method can include selecting based on the plurality of segment definitions a second proposed process chain including a first proposed segment corresponding with the existing segment from the plurality of existing segments and including a second proposed segment different from each existing segment from the plurality of existing segments. The method can also include defining an option for an operational relationship between the existing segment from the plurality of existing segments and the second proposed segment of the first proposed process chain and defining a prerequisite for an operational relationship between the existing segment from the plurality of existing segments and the second proposed segment of the second proposed process chain.

The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features will be apparent from the description and drawings and from the claims.

The proposed process chains can be defined by a hierarchy that includes segments enterprise processes and or process steps. The proposed process chains can include segments that collectively define the process chain of the proposed process chains . For example as shown in proposed process chain X from the proposed process chains includes segments A through C also can be referred to as proposed segments . In some embodiments each of the segments of the proposed process chains can include one or more enterprise processes not shown and each of the enterprise processes can include one or more process steps not shown .

Similarly the existing process chains can be defined by a hierarchy that includes segments enterprise processes and process steps. For example each of the existing process chains G and G can include segments also can be referred to as existing segments . Specifically existing process chain G include segments GA and GB and existing process chain G includes segments GA through GE. Also each of the segments of the existing process chains can include one or more enterprise processes not shown and each of the enterprise processes can include one or more process steps not shown . An abstract example of a process chain hierarchy e.g. an existing process chain hierarchy a proposed process chain hierarchy is shown in .

As a specific example the proposed process chain can be an engineer to order process chain and one or more of the segments of the engineer to order process chain can be for example an engineer to order sales quote segment PC a special production segment a standard invoice segment and or so forth. One or more of the enterprise processes can be for example a quotation enterprise process a project execution enterprise process a production enterprise process and or so forth. Each of the enterprise processes can include one or more process steps such as a credit check process step an advertising campaign determination step and or so forth. More details related to the hierarchical relationships of process chains segments enterprise processes and process steps are discussed for example in connection with .

Referring back to operational relationships between the segments e.g. segments of the existing process chains segments of the proposed process chains are represented by arrows between the segments. Specifically the double sided arrows represent bidirectional operational relationships e.g. bidirectional data transfer bidirectional triggering of functions bidirectional access and the single sided arrows represent operational relationships in a single direction e.g. a unidirectional operational relationship . For example the segment A included in proposed process chain X can be configured to operate with e.g. trigger functionality of send data to segment B included in proposed process chain X. As another example the segment GA included in existing process chain G can be configured to operate with segment GB included in existing process chain G as represented by the arrow between segment GA and segment GB.

The process module can be configured to produce a solution package that includes an implementation of one or more segments or portion s of thereof of one or more of the proposed process chains so that the segment s of the proposed process chain s can operate with e.g. can be accessed by can be triggered by existing process chain G and or operate with existing process chain G. In other words segments or portion s thereof of the proposed process chain s that can operate with the existing process chain s can be included in a solution package. In some embodiments the segment s of the proposed process chain s or portion s thereof can be triggered by for example a process step e.g. instances of a triggering process step included in an enterprise process of a segment of the existing process chain s .

In some embodiments the segment s or portion s thereof of the proposed process chain s can be consolidated in one or more solution packages so that separate instances of the segment s or portion s thereof of the proposed process chain s do not need to be included in each of existing process chains . For example in some embodiments existing process chains G and G can operate with a common segment of one of the proposed process chains included into a solution package.

As a specific example segment C from the proposed process chain X can be included in a solution package that can operate with existing process chain G and existing process chain G. The functionality of the segment C from the proposed process chain X when included in the solution package can be triggered by for example segment GB of the existing process chain G. The segment C when included in the solution package can be configured to trigger for example the functionality of segment GA of the existing process chain G.

In some embodiments one or more new process chains can be defined based on a combination of segments of the proposed process chains with the existing process chains . For example segments A and segment C from the proposed process chain X can be included in a solution package that can operate with existing process chain G to define two new process chains. The first new process chain can include segment A from proposed process chain X and segments GA and GB from the existing process chain G. The second new process chain can include segment C from proposed process chain X and segments GA and GB from the existing process chain G. In this example the segments GA and GB from the existing process chain G are reused in each of the new process chains.

In some embodiments one or more of the proposed process chains can each be an end to end process chain. Accordingly the functionality from one or more of the proposed process chains can be added to one or more of the existing process chains so that the one or more existing process chains when combined with the functionality of the one or more proposed process chains in a solution package can define an end to end process chain. For example the proposed process chain X can be an end to end process chain that is defined by segments A through C. The existing process chain G may not be an end to end process chain but the segments GA and GB may correspond with e.g. may have functionality that corresponds with segments A and B of the proposed process chain X. The functionality of segment C from the proposed process chain X can be added to the existing process chain G in a solution package so that segments GA and GB combined with segment C when in a solution package can collectively define an end to end process chain that corresponds with the proposed process chain X. Thus the existing process chain G can be adapted to have the overall functionality of the proposed process chain X via an operational relationship with the solution package including the segment C of the proposed process chain X.

Although not shown in the existing process chains and or the proposed process chains can be associated with one or more process definitions. A process definition can include information associated with one or more functions of any portion of one or more of the existing process chains and or one or more of the proposed process chains . For example a process definition associated with existing process chain G can include information about the functionality of the existing process chain G interfaces between one or more portions of the existing process chain G the version of one or more portions of the existing process chain G the operational relationships within the existing process chain G data that can be processed within the existing process chain G and or a portion thereof and or so forth.

Process definitions like the process chains themselves can have a hierarchy including process chain definitions segment definitions enterprise process definitions and process step definitions. In other words a process definition can include information associated with any level of hierarchy of the existing process chain s and or the proposed process chain s . In some embodiments each of these process definitions when associated with a specified level of hierarchy of a process chain can be referred to as a type of process definition. In some embodiments a process chain definition which is associated with a process chain level of the hierarchy of a process chain can include information about the overall functionality of a process chain. A segment definition which is associated with a segment level of the hierarchy of a process chain can include information about one or more segments of the process chain. An enterprise process definition which is associated with an enterprise process level of the hierarchy of a process chain can include details about one or more enterprise processes included in a segment and a process step definition which is associated with a process step level of the hierarchy of a process chain can include details about one or more process steps included in an enterprise process.

In some embodiments the level of detail of a process definition can be correlated to the hierarchy. For example a process chain definition which is associated with a process chain level of the hierarchy of a process chain can include high level information while a process step definition which is associated with a process step level of the hierarchy of a process chain can include relatively granular information compared with the process chain definition about a particular process step. Thus the process steps definitions lower in a hierarchy of a process chain can include details that are not included in higher levels of a hierarchy of the process chain. In some embodiments process definitions higher in a hierarchy of a process chain can be a superset of process definitions lower in the hierarchy of the process chain. For example a process chain definition can include the information included in a segment definition while the segment definition may not include information that is included in the process chain definition.

In some embodiments the process definitions can be referenced within one another. For example a segment definition from the segment definitions related to segment PC can include references to enterprise process definitions from the enterprise process definitions related to enterprise processes included in segment PC. Thus a process module such as process module shown in can access information included in a process definition related to a particular level of a hierarchy of a process chain on an as needed basis by navigating references included within the process definitions.

Referring back to as discussed herein a solution package associated with an existing process chain can be any type of hardware and or software combination that can operate with the existing process chains which can also be based on any type of hardware and or software combination at the computer system . In other words the solution package can be an implementation of or can be used to implement of one or more of the segments or a portion thereof of the proposed process chains in a solution package associated with the existing process chains at the computer system . For example the solution package can be an executable software module that can be installed on the computer system .

One or more existing process chains and or one or more proposed process chains can be processed by the process module e.g. the process chain module of the process module to produce one or more solution packages. Specifically the processing performed by the process module can be in some embodiments categorized into one or more stages of processing. An example of stages of processing that can be performed by the process module to produce one or more solution packages is shown in .

As shown in the process chain module includes an existing process chain module . During the existing process chain analysis stage shown in the existing process chain module is configured to select one or more of the existing process chains that are eligible for operation with a solution package. An existing process chain can be referred to as being eligible for operation with a solution package when at least a portion of the existing process chain can be configured to operate with e.g. trigger at least a portion of the solution package.

The existing process chain module can be configured to determine whether or not one or more portions e.g. process steps of the existing process chains can be configured to trigger at least a portion of a proposed process chain included in a solution package based on one or more eligibility conditions not shown . An eligibility condition is any type of condition that can be used to determine the eligibility of one or more of the existing process chains for operation with a solution package. An eligibility condition can be used to enforce one or more prerequisites e.g. an upgrade prerequisite a configuration prerequisite that can be for example defined by a user e.g. an administrator . Thus an eligibility condition can be defined based on one or more prerequisites. In some embodiments an existing process chain that is eligible for operation with a solution package can be referred to as being eligible or eligible for operation. In some embodiments an existing process chain that is not eligible for operation with a solution package can be referred to as being ineligible or ineligible for operation.

For example an eligibility condition may be satisfied for a particular existing process chain from the existing process chains when the existing process chain can be configured to interface with e.g. send data to received data from a solution package. As a specific example existing process chain G may be eligible for operation because existing process chain G can be interfaced with e.g. can trigger functionality of a solution package while existing process chain G may not be eligible because existing process chain G cannot be interfaced with e.g. cannot trigger functionality of a solution package. In some embodiments an eligibility condition may be satisfied for a particular existing process chain from the existing process chains when the existing process chain can be configured to trigger functionality associated with one or more segments of the proposed process chains that can be included in one or more solution package. In some embodiments an eligibility condition may be satisfied for a particular existing process chain from the existing process chains when the existing process chain is associated with a program version e.g. program version 1.2C that is compatible with a program version of one or more segments of the proposed process chains that can be included in one or more solution packages. In some embodiments one or more eligibility conditions not shown can be stored in e.g. stored in an eligibility condition database and or accessed from a memory .

In some embodiments the existing process chain module can be configured to determine the eligibility of one or more of the existing process chains for operation with one or more solution packages based on a process definition e.g. a process chain definition a segment definition an enterprise process definition a process step definition associated with one or more portions of the existing process chains satisfying one or more eligibility conditions. For example the existing process chain module can be configured to determine that at least a portion of existing process chain G is eligible for operation with a solution package based on a portion of a segment definition of existing process chain G that satisfies an eligibility condition. These example eligibility conditions are presented by way of example only and are not inclusive of all of the types of eligibility conditions that can be used to determine the eligibility of one or more of the existing process chains .

The process chain module also includes a proposed process chain module . During the proposed process chain selection stage shown in the proposed process chain module is configured to select one or more proposed process chains stored in the memory that have portions e.g. segments process steps that can be appended to at least a portion of one or more of the existing process chains . For example each of the proposed process chains can include one or more segments that can be appended via an operational relationship to one or more of the existing process chains via a solution package.

The proposed process chain module can be configured to determine whether or not one or more of the proposed process chains includes portions that can be appended to one or more of the existing process chains based on one or more solution package conditions not shown . A solution package condition is any type of condition that can be used to select at least one of the proposed process chains for adaptation to at least one of the existing process chains . A solution package condition can be used to enforce one or more prerequisites e.g. an upgrade prerequisite a configuration prerequisite for an operational relationship between a solution package and at least one of the existing process chains . Thus a solution package condition can be produced based on one or more prerequisites which can be defined by a user such as an administrator .

In some embodiments The proposed process chain module can be configured to determine whether or not one or more of the proposed process chains includes one or more portions that can be appended to at least one of the existing process chains based on at least a portion of a process definition or a portion thereof associated with the existing process chains satisfying one or more solution package conditions. For example the proposed process chain module can be configured to select a proposed process chain from proposed process chains for operation with existing process chain G based on a portion of a segment definition of existing process chain G that satisfies a solution package condition.

For example a solution package condition may be satisfied for a particular proposed process chain from the proposed process chains when the proposed process chain has at least one segment that corresponds with at least one of segments of at least one of the existing process chains or a subset that is eligible . A determination as to whether or not at least one segment from the proposed process chain corresponds with at least one of the segments of at least one of the existing process chains can be determined based on a comparison of their respective process definitions or portions thereof . A segment from the proposed process chain can correspond with a segment of at least one of the existing process chains when the segment from the proposed process chain is identical to or has equivalent functionality to the segment of at least one of the existing process chain . As a specific example proposed process chain X can be selected by the proposed process chain module for potential operation with existing process chain G when the proposed process chain X includes a segment e.g. segment B that corresponds with a segment e.g. segment GB of the existing process chain G and is eligible .

As another example a solution package condition may be satisfied for a particular proposed process chain from the proposed process chains when the proposed process chain can interface e.g. compatibly interface with at least one of segments of at least one of the existing process chains or subset that is eligible . As a specific example proposed process chain X can be selected by the proposed process chain module for potential operation with existing process chain G when the proposed process chain X includes a segment e.g. segment C that can interface with a segment e.g. segment GA of the existing process chain G and when existing process chain G is eligible . In some embodiments proposed process chain X may not be selected by the proposed process chain module for potential operation with existing process chain G when the existing process chain G is ineligible even though the proposed process chain X includes a segment that can interface with a segment of the existing process chain G . In some embodiments the compatibility of one or more of the proposed process chains with the existing process chains can be determined based on their respective process definitions or portions thereof .

In some embodiments the proposed process chain module can be configured to select a proposed process chain from the proposed process chains only if a portion of the proposed process chain can have an operational relationship with more than one of the existing process chains . For example the proposed process chain module can be configured to select a first proposed process chain from the proposed process chains because the first propose process chain includes at least a portion that can have an operational relationship with both existing process chain G and existing process chain G. A second proposed process chain may not be selected from the proposed process chains because the second proposed process chain may have a portion that can have an operational relationship with only one existing process chain from the existing process chains .

In some embodiments one or more solution package conditions may satisfied if one or more of existing process chains and or the proposed process chains are modified. For example a proposed process chain from the proposed process chains may be associated with a first program version e.g. program version 3.0 and the existing process chains may be associated with a second program version e.g. program version 1.0 . The proposed process chain from the proposed process chains may be selected by the propose solution package manager if the existing process chains are modified e.g. upgraded to a program version that is compatible with the first program version. These example solution package conditions are presented by way of example only and are not inclusive of all of the types of solution package conditions that can be used to select one or more of the proposed process chains for operation with the existing process chains .

In some embodiments at least some portions of processing associated with the existing process chain analysis stage and at least some portions of the proposed process chain analysis stage can be performed concurrently. For example eligibility of one or more of the existing process chains can be determined based on one or more eligibility conditions in parallel with a determination as to whether or not one or more of the proposed process chains includes a portion that can be appended to one or more of the proposed process chains based on one or more solution package conditions.

As shown in the process chain module includes an operational relationship module . During the operational relationship stage shown in the operational relationship module is configured to determine one or more prerequisites and or one or more options for one or more operational relationships between the existing process chains and the proposed process chains selected during the existing process chain analysis stage and the proposed process chain analysis stage respectively. In some embodiments options for an operational relationship can be referred to as operational relationship options or as options and prerequisites for an operational relationship can be referred to as operational relationship prerequisites or as prerequisites.

In some embodiments a prerequisite can be a requirement for the functionality of an operational relationship between at least a portion of one or more of the existing process chains and a solution package including at least a portion of one or more of the proposed process chains . For example the operational relationship module can be configured to determine a prerequisite for implementation of an operational relationship between a segment of the existing process chain G and a segment of the proposed process chain X which can be included in a solution package. The prerequisite can include for example a requirement to modify e.g. upgrade at least a portion of the segment of the existing process chain G so that the segment of the proposed process chain X can have an operational relationship e.g. can have a functional operational relationship with the segment of the existing process chain G.

In some embodiments the options can be selectable features related to also can be referred to as proposed operation features operational relationships that can be used to produce a solution package including at least a portion of one or more of the proposed process chains for one or more of the existing process chains . In other words the proposed process chains can be associated with or can include a definition e.g. a map a set of parameter values a database of operational relationship options e.g. interface options that can be included in a solution package. For example the operational relationship module can be configured to determine an option that can be implemented for an operational relationship between the segment of the existing process chain G and the segment the proposed process chain X when included in the solution package. The option can include for example an option related to a type of interface for the operational relationship between the segment of the existing process chain G and the segment of the proposed process chain X. In some embodiments an option can include for example an option related to an interface e.g. an external interface with a an external application e.g. third party application different from an application or platform associated with the existing process chains and or the proposed process chains .

As shown in the process chain module includes a user interface module configured to define one or more user interfaces not shown in that can be presented to a user . The user interfaces can be presented to the user via a display of the computer system . The user interface module can be configured to manage e.g. send manipulate trigger execution of user interfaces through which users such as user can access e.g. use trigger the functionality of the process module e.g. the functionality of the process chain module . For example prerequisites and or options related to operational relationships between one or more of the proposed process chains and one or more of the existing process chains can be presented to the user via a user interface of the user interface module . Specifically one or more of the operational relationship prerequisites can be visually represented for to a user e.g. user via a user interface of the user interface module . Also one or more of the operational relationship options can be visually represented for selection by a user e.g. user via the user interface of the user interface module and the selected operational relationship options can be included in the solution package for one or more of the existing process chains . Accordingly the proposed process chains can each function as a tool that can be used e.g. used by a user to produce a solution package for one or more the existing process chains . Said differently the proposed process chains can be used to produce solution packages that can be actually installed on the computer system .

In some embodiments prerequisites that may satisfy one or more solution package conditions and or eligibility conditions can be presented to the user . These prerequisites may be presented to the user so that the user can optionally make modifications to satisfy one or more of the solution package conditions and or one or more of eligibility conditions. For example the process chain module e.g. via a user interface module of the process chain module can be configured to notify the user that at least a portion of a proposed process chain from the proposed process chains may have an operational relationship with one or more of the existing process chains if the one or more existing process chains is modified e.g. upgraded to a specified program version . Accordingly one or more of the existing process chains can be modified e.g. upgraded to at least the specified program version to be compatible with a solution package produced based on a proposed process chain from the proposed process chains . In some embodiments one or more solution package conditions and or eligibility conditions may be over ridden e.g. manually disabled ignored by the user .

In some embodiments one or more of the user interfaces of the user interface module can be for example a browser based user interface that includes various buttons links controls services and or so forth that can be used by a user such as a user to access the functionality of the process module . The user interface s can be rendered within the display for the user so that the user can access one or more functions of the process module . For example the user can using the computer system access a user interface served by the user interface module to a browser application of the computer system . The user can then use the user interface to trigger one or more functions associated with the computer system .

As shown in the functionality of the process module can be accessed e.g. can be triggered via the computer system on which the existing process chains are installed. Specifically the functionality of the process module can be accessed via the computer system and the display of the computer system . In some embodiments the functionality of the process module can be accessed e.g. can be triggered by the user via a terminal device not shown associated with the computer system .

In some embodiments a portion of at least one of the proposed process chains can have one or more proposed mandatory operational relationships which can be proposed operation features with at least a portion of one or more existing process chains . For example an operational relationship between a proposed process chain included in proposed process chain X and existing process chain G can be classified as a mandatory operational relationship based on a process definition associated with the existing process chain G. Accordingly if a solution package is produced based on the proposed process chain X the solution package must include an implementation of the operational relationship between the proposed process chain X included in the solution package and the existing process chain X. In other words the existing process chain G must be configured to operate with the proposed process chain X included in the solution package based on the mandatory operational relationship.

In some embodiments an operational relationship between at least a portion of at least one proposed process chain and at least a portion of at least one existing process chain can be classified as an optional operational relationship. For example if a solution package is produced based on proposed process chain X and the existing process chain G the solution package could include an implementation of the operational relationship between the proposed process chain included in the solution package and the existing process chain G. In other words the existing process chain G can be configured to operate with the proposed process chain X included in the solution package based on the optional operational relationship.

As shown in the process chain module includes a solution package generator configured to produce a solution package based on one or more of the proposed process chains . During the solution package implementation stage shown in the solution package generator can be configured to produce the solution package based on one or more of the options e.g. selected options and or prerequisites related to an operational relationship between at least one of the existing process chains and at least one of the proposed process chains .

In some embodiments the solution package can include configuration data associated with a configuration file defining at least a portion of the existing process chain and or proposed process chain or portion thereof for which the solution package is produced. Configuration data can be included in a database repository and can be configured to define one or more functions of one or more proposed process chains associated with one or more existing process chains.

In some embodiments a solution package can be or can include one or more databases any type of executable software module such as a computer program based on but not limited to micro code or micro instructions machine instructions such as produced by a compiler code used to produce a web service and files containing higher level instructions that are executed by a computer using an interpreter. For example or more portions of a solution package may be implemented using Java C or other programming languages e.g. object oriented programming languages and development tools. In some embodiments a solution package for one or more existing process chains can define at least a portion of one or more applications or can be associated with one or more applications of the computer system . In some embodiments a solution package can be or can include a user interface component associated with one or more existing process chains and the user interface component can be configured for display e.g. rendering . In some embodiments one or more solution packages can have or can be a background process with functionality that is not visible i.e. not displayed .

Although not shown in some embodiments the process module or portions thereof can be configured to operate within for example a data center e.g. a cloud computing environment a computer system one or more server host devices and or so forth. In some embodiments the functionality of the process module can be distributed to several devices.

In some embodiments one or more portions of the components shown in the process module in can be or can include a hardware based module e.g. a digital signal processor DSP a field programmable gate array FPGA a memory a firmware module and or a software based module e.g. a module of computer code a set of computer readable instructions that can be executed at a computer . For example in some embodiments one or more portions of the process chain module can be or can include a software module configured for execution by at least one processor not shown . The processor can be configured to execute one or more instructions and can include one or more co processors and or memory portions. In some embodiments the functionality of the components can be included in different modules and or components than those shown in . For example although not shown the functionality of the process chain module can be included in a different module than the process chain module or divided into several different modules.

Although not shown in some embodiments the memory can be implemented as more than one memory component e.g. more than one random access memory RAM component or disk drive memory within the process module . In some embodiments the memory can be a database memory. In some embodiments the memory can be or can include a non local memory e.g. a memory not physically included within the process module . For example the memory can be or can include a memory shared by multiple devices not shown . In some embodiments the memory can be associated with a server device not shown within a network and configured to serve the process module .

In some embodiments the process module or portions thereof and or the computer system or portions thereof can be configured to operate within a network. In other words the process module or portions thereof and or the computer system or portions thereof can be configured to function within various types of network environments that can include one or more client devices and or one or more server devices. For example the network can be or can include a local area network LAN a wide area network WAN and or so forth. The network can be or can include a wireless network and or wireless network implemented using for example gateway devices bridges switches and or so forth. The network can include one or more segments and or can have portions based on various protocols such as Internet Protocol IP and or a proprietary protocol. The network can include at least a portion of the Internet.

The computer system can be for example a wired device and or a wireless device e.g. wi fi enabled device and can be for example a computing entity e.g. a personal computing device a mobile phone a personal digital assistant PDA a server device e.g. a web server a host device and or so forth.

In some embodiments at least a portion of the plurality of existing process chains can be selected based on an eligibility condition being satisfied. In some embodiments the plurality of segment definitions can be received by an existing process chain module e.g. existing process chain module shown in during an existing process chain analysis stage e.g. existing process chain analysis stage shown in .

Based on the plurality of segment definitions a first proposed process chain is selected that includes a first proposed segment corresponding with an existing segment from the plurality of existing segments and includes a second proposed segment different from each existing segment from the plurality of existing segments block . For example the proposed process chain module shown in can be configured to select based on the plurality of segment definitions a first proposed process chain that includes a first proposed segment corresponding with an existing segment from the plurality of existing segments and includes a second proposed segment different from each existing segment from the plurality of existing segments.

The first proposed segment of the first proposed process chain can correspond with the existing segment from the plurality of existing segments when the functionality of the first proposed segment of the first proposed process chain is the same as or substantially the same as that of the existing segment. The first proposed segment of the first proposed process chain can be different than the existing segment from the plurality of existing segments because the functionality of the first proposed segment of the first proposed process chain is different than that of the existing segment. The first proposed process chain can be selected from a set of proposed process chains such as proposed process chain is shown in . In some embodiments the first proposed process chain can be selected based on a solution package condition being satisfied.

Based on the plurality of segment definitions a second proposed process chain is selected that includes a first proposed segment corresponding with the existing segment from the plurality of existing segments and includes a second proposed segment different from each existing segment from the plurality of existing segments block . For example the proposed process chain module shown in can be configured to select based on the plurality of segment definitions a second proposed process chain that includes a first proposed segment corresponding with the existing segment from the plurality of existing segments and includes a second proposed segment different from each existing segment from the plurality of existing segments.

The first proposed segment of the second proposed process chain can correspond with the existing segment from the plurality of existing segments when the functionality of the second proposed segment of the second proposed process chain is the same as or substantially the same as that of the existing segment. The first proposed segment of the second proposed process chain can be different than the existing segment from the plurality of existing segments because the functionality of the first proposed segment of the second proposed process chain is different than that of the existing segment. The second proposed process chain can be selected from a set of proposed process chains such as proposed process chain is shown in . In some embodiments the second proposed process chain can be selected based on a solution package condition being satisfied.

In some embodiments the first proposed process chain and the second proposed process chain can be selected by a proposed process chain module e.g. proposed process chain module shown in . In some embodiments the first proposed process chain and the second proposed process chain can be selected during a proposed process chain analysis stage e.g. proposed process chain analysis stage shown in .

An option for an operational relationship between the existing segment from the plurality of existing segments and the second proposed segment of the first proposed process chain is defined block . For example the operational relationship module shown in can be configured to define the option for an operational relationship between the existing segment from the plurality of existing segments and the second proposed segment of the first proposed process chain. In some embodiments the option for the operational relationship can be selected for inclusion in a solution package by for example a user. In some embodiments the option for the operational relationship may not be selected for inclusion in a solution package by for example a user.

Also a prerequisite for an operational relationship between the existing segment from the plurality of existing segments and the second proposed segment of the second proposed process chain is defined block . For example the operational relationship module shown in can be configured to define the prerequisite for an operational relationship between the existing segment from the plurality of existing segments and the second proposed segment of the second proposed process chain. In some embodiments the prerequisite can be related to an operation that must be performed before a solution package can be defined for the existing process chain. In some embodiments the option for the operational relationship and the prerequisite for the operational relationship can be defined or presented by an operational relationship module e.g. operational relationship module shown in during an operational relationship stage e.g. operational relationship stage shown in .

In this embodiment operational relationships between the segments e.g. proposed segments existing segments are represented by arrows between the segments. For example the operational relationship between proposed segment Q and the proposed segment Q of the proposed process chain QB is a bidirectional operational relationship. In a bidirectional operational relationship one or more aspects e.g. data transfer triggering of functions access of the operational relationship can be bidirectional. As another example the operational relationship between existing segment Q and existing segment Q of existing process chain Q is in a single direction e.g. a unidirectional operational relationship .

In some embodiments the existing process chain Q the proposed process chain QA and or the proposed process chain QB can be any type of process chain or portions thereof . For example the proposed process chain QB can be an engineer to order process chain a sell from stock process chain a sell from stock consignment process chain and or so forth.

As illustrated by the dashed arrows shown in proposed segments Q through Q of the proposed process chain QA correspond with the existing segments Q through Q respectively of the existing process chain Q. Also proposed segments Q and Q of the proposed process chain QB correspond with the existing segments Q and Q respectively of the existing process chain Q.

In some embodiments the proposed process chain QA the proposed process chain QB and or the existing process chain Q can be associated with the same or different program versions. For example although proposed segments Q through Q of the proposed process chain QA correspond with the existing segments Q through Q respectively of the existing process chain Q the existing segments Q through Q of the proposed process chain QA can be an upgraded version of proposed segments Q through Q of the proposed process chain QA.

In some embodiments a proposed process chain module e.g. proposed process chain module shown in can be configured to identify the correspondence between the existing segments of the existing process chain Q and the proposed segments of the respective proposed process chains QA and QB. In some embodiments the proposed process chains QA and QB can be selected based on the correspondence of the proposed segments of the proposed process chains QA and QB with the existing segments of the existing process chain Q from a set of proposed process chains e.g. proposed process chains shown in as proposed process chains that have segments that can be added to the existing process chain Q. In some embodiments the correspondence between the existing segments of the existing process chain Q and the proposed segments of the respective proposed process chains QA and QB can be performed during a proposed process chain analysis stage e.g. proposed process chain analysis stage shown in . In some embodiments the correspondence between the existing process chain Q and proposed process chains QA and QB can be presented to a user via a user interface so that a user can determine e.g. select whether one or more segments of the proposed process chains QA or QB should or should not be combined with the existing process chain Q using a solution package.

The is a block diagram that illustrates a combination of the existing process chain Q and the proposed process chains shown in . As shown in several of the proposed segments of the proposed process chains QA and QB are appended to the existing segments of the existing process chain Q to define model process chain QA and QB respectively. Specifically the proposed segments of the proposed process chains QA and QB that do not correspond with or are not already included in the existing segments of the existing process chain Q are appended to the existing process chain Q to define model process chain QA and QB respectively.

As shown in proposed segments from the proposed process chain QA and existing segments from the existing process chain Q which are shown in are combined to define model process chain QA. Specifically proposed segment Q of proposed process chain QA is appended to i.e. appended before the existing segments of the existing process chain Q so that the proposed segment Q of proposed process chain QA has an operational relationship with existing segment Q of the existing process chain Q. In some embodiments the operational relationship can be defined so that the proposed segment Q of proposed process chain QA is configured to trigger e.g. trigger execution of at least a portion of existing segment Q of the existing process chain Q. Proposed segment Q of proposed process chain QA is appended to i.e. appended after the existing segments of the existing process chain Q such that the proposed segment Q of proposed process chain QA has an operational relationship with existing segment Q of the existing process chain Q. In some embodiments the operational relationship can be defined so that the existing segment Q of existing process chain Q is configured to trigger e.g. trigger execution of at least a portion of proposed segment Q of the proposed process chain QA.

As shown in the combination of the existing segments Q through Q of the existing process chain Q and the proposed segments Q and Q of the proposed process chain QA define model process chain QA that corresponds with the proposed process chain QA shown in . Also as shown in the existing segments Q through Q of the existing process chain Q are not replaced by the proposed segments Q through Q of the proposed process chain QA.

As shown in a proposed segments from the proposed process chain QB and existing segments from the existing process chain Q which are shown in are combined to define model process chain QB. Specifically proposed segment Q of proposed process chain QB is appended before the existing segments of the existing process chain Q so that the proposed segment Q of proposed process chain QB has an operational relationship with existing segment Q of the existing process chain Q. In some embodiments the operational relationship can be defined so that the proposed segment Q of proposed process chain QB is configured to trigger e.g. trigger execution of at least a portion of existing segment Q of the existing process chain Q. Proposed segments Q and Q of proposed process chain QB are appended to the existing segments of the existing process chain Q. However only proposed segment Q of proposed process chain QB has an operational relationship with existing segment Q of the existing process chain Q. The operational relationship can be defined so that the existing segment Q of existing process chain Q is configured to trigger e.g. trigger execution of at least a portion of proposed segment Q of the proposed process chain QB.

As shown in the combination of the existing segments Q and Q of the existing process chain Q and the proposed segments Q Q and Q of the proposed process chain QB define model process chain QB which corresponds with the proposed process chain QB shown in . In this embodiment the existing segments Q and Q of the existing process chain Q are not replaced by the proposed segments Q and Q of the proposed process chain QB. Also as shown in the existing segment Q of the existing process chain Q is not included in model process chain QB which corresponds with the proposed process chain QB shown in . Thus not all of the existing segments from an existing process chain need to be included in a model process chain that is a combination of proposed segments of a proposed process chain and existing segments from an existing process chain.

As shown in at least some of the existing segments of the existing process chain Q are common to e.g. reused in both model process chain QA and model process chain QB. Specifically existing segment Q and existing segment Q are included in both model process chain QA and model process chain QB. Thus two different process chains model process chain QA and model process chain QB can be produced by appending segments to the existing segments of the existing process chain Q. In some embodiments model process chain QA can be considered a variant of model process chain QB and vice versa.

In some embodiments the model process chains QA and QB can be defined by a proposed process chain module e.g. proposed process chain module shown in . In some embodiments the model process chains QA and QB can be presented to a user via a user interface defined by a user interface module e.g. user interface module shown in .

In the embodiment shown in the proposed segments of the proposed process chains QA and QB are combined with the existing segments of the existing process chain Q to define model process chains that corresponds with the proposed process chains QA and QB shown in . Although not shown in in some embodiments less than all of the proposed segments of the proposed process chains QA and or QB may be combined with all or less than all of the existing segments of the existing process chain Q to define model process chains. For example model process chain QA can be defined without proposed segment Q from proposed process chain QA. As another example model process chain QA can be defined without existing segment Q of the existing process chain Q. In these examples model process chain QA would not correspond with the proposed process chain QA.

In some embodiments if presented to a user via a user interface the user interface can be defined so that the user may modify model process chain QA and or QB via the user interface after the model process chains QA and QB have been defined as shown in . For example one or more of the proposed segments and or existing segments can be removed from the model process chains. In some embodiments one or more operational relationships between one or more of the proposed segments and one or more of the existing segments can be modified. For example one or more operational relationships can be modified so that an order of the proposed segments and the existing segments included in model process chain QB are different than that shown in .

In some embodiments one or more of the segments from the proposed process chains QA in QB shown in can be selected to replace one or more of the existing segments from the existing process chain Q. For example proposed segment Q from proposed process chain QB shown in can be selected to replace existing segment Q included in existing process change Q. In some embodiments if presented to a user via a user interface the user interface can be used by the user to make this type of modification.

Although not shown in one or more options and or one or more prerequisites can be related to the operational relationships between the existing segments and or proposed segments of the model process chains QA and QB. For example a prerequisite for the operational relationship between existing segment Q proposed segment Q can be an upgrade to existing segment Q. In some embodiments one or more interfaces associated with existing segment Q and or proposed segment Q may need to be modified so that existing segment Q and proposed segment Q can have an operational relationship e.g. a compatible operational relationship .

In some embodiments one or more of the proposed segments from the proposed process chains QA and or QB can be appended to the existing segments of the existing process chain Q to automate portions of a process not shown that are performed manually in conjunction with existing process chain Q. For example proposed segment Q of proposed process chain QB shown in can be an automatic quotation process. Although not shown in the quotation process may be a process manually performed in conjunction with existing process chain Q. When the proposed segment Q of proposed process chain QB is appended to the existing process chain Q as shown in the manually performed quotation process associated with existing process chain Q may be replaced by the automatic quotation process implemented in proposed segment Q.

Although not explicitly shown in the solution packages SP and or SP can be configured to implement or facilitate implementation of at least a portion of the operational relationships between the existing segments and the proposed segments. For example solution package SP can include an interface related to the operational relationship between the existing segment Q and the proposed segment Q. In some embodiments an interface can be for example a software and or hardware interface that can be used to trigger e.g. trigger execution of for example one or more portions of a segment of a process chain. In some embodiments the interface can be an application programming interface API . In some embodiments the interface can be a process step e.g. instances of a process step that can be referred to as a trigger process step or as a triggering process step e.g. instances of a triggering process step . In some embodiments data e.g. one or more parameter values can be sent and or received via an interface.

Although not explicitly shown in in some embodiments one or more of the existing segments of the existing process chain Q can be configured to implement or facilitate implementation of at least a portion of the operational relationships between the existing segments and the proposed segments. For example an interface related to the operational relationship between existing segment Q and the proposed segment Q can be included in e.g. installed within existing segment Q.

In some embodiments one or more dormant interfaces can be used to implement or facilitate implementation of at least a portion of an operational relationship between an existing segment and a proposed segment. For example a dormant interface included in existing segment Q can be activated and used to implement the operational relationship between existing segment Q and proposed segment Q. In some embodiments an interface e.g. a dormant interface already included in e.g. installed within one or more of the existing segments can be modified e.g. upgraded configuration can be modified to implement or facilitate implementation of at least a portion of the operational relationships between existing segments in the proposed segments.

In some embodiments an operational relationship between several segments can be implemented using a common interface. For example the operational relationships between proposed segment Q and Q and existing segment Q can be implemented via a common interface that can be included in solution package SP and or existing segment Q.

In some embodiments a solution package different than the solution packages SP and SP shown in can be produced. For example a single solution package including all of the proposed segments having an operational relationship with the existing segments from the existing process chain Q can be produced. In some embodiments more solution packages than solution package SP and SP shown in can be produced based on the proposed segments from model process chain QA and model process chain QB.

As shown in the existing segments of the existing process chain Q are represented in a column associated with Existing Process Chain Segments . Proposed segments of proposed process chain QA that can be included in a solution package are illustrated in a column associated with Proposed Process Chain QA . Proposed segments of proposed process chain QB that can be included in a solution package are illustrated in a column associated with Proposed Process Chain QB .

The placement of proposed segment Q to the right of existing segment Q represents that the proposed segment Q can have an operational relationship with existing segment Q and or existing segment Q in a solution package. Similarly the placement of proposed segment Q to the right of existing segment Q represents that the proposed segment Q can have an operational relationship with existing segment Q in a solution package. In some embodiments the operational relationships can be mandatory operational relationship or optional operational relationships.

Each of segments of the proposed process chains QA and QB shown in are placed next to a set of selection boxes or selection boxes respectively that can each be used to select whether or not a solution package should be configured so that one or more of the proposed segments of the proposed process chains QA and QB can operate with one or more of the existing segments of the existing process chain Q. As shown in the X in the selection box from the set of selection boxes next to proposed process chain Q in the Proposed Process Chain QA indicates that a solution package when produced will enable proposed segment Q of proposed process chain QA to operate with existing segment Q of existing process chain Q. The absence of a mark in the selection box can represent that proposed segment of the proposed process chain will not operate with an existing segment of the existing process chain in a solution package.

As shown in operational relationship options F through F which are included in a column associated with Operational Relationship Options can be selected via the selection boxes . The operational relationship options F through F are associated with an operational relationship e.g. a potential operational relationship between proposed segment Q and existing segment Q as represented by the arrow from proposed segment Q. An operational relationship option can include for example an option related to an interface type associated with the operational relationship.

As shown in an operational relationship prerequisite M is shown in a column associated with Operational Relationship Prerequisite . The operational relationship prerequisite is associated with an operational relationship between proposed segment Q and existing segment Q as represented by the arrow from proposed segment Q. An operational relationship prerequisite can include for example a requirement to upgrade a proposed segment and or an existing segment.

The enterprise process user interface also includes a Generate Solution Package button. In response to the Generate Solution Package button being actuated a solution package with the selections can be produced by for example a solution package generator such as solution package generator shown in .

As illustrated by the dashed arrows shown in proposed segments K through K of the proposed process chain KC correspond with the existing segments K through K respectively of the existing process chain KB. Proposed segments K and K of the proposed process chain KD correspond with the existing segments K and K respectively of the existing process chain KB. Also proposed segment K of the proposed process chain KC corresponds with the proposed segment K of the proposed process chain KD. As illustrated by the dotted double sided arrow the existing process chain KA is eligible e.g. eligible for operation because the existing segment K of the existing process chain KA can have an operational relationship with proposed segment K which is common to both proposed process chain KC and proposed process chain KD. In other words an instance of proposed segment K is associated with proposed process chain KC and proposed process chain KD.

The is a block diagram that illustrates a combination of the existing process chains and the proposed process chains shown in . As shown in several of the proposed segments of the proposed process chains KC and KD are appended to the existing segments of the existing process chains KA and KB. As shown in the proposed segments K and K of the proposed process chain KC shown in are appended to the existing process chain KB to define model process chain KC which corresponds with proposed process chain KC shown in . Also the proposed segments K and K of the proposed process chain KD shown in are appended to the existing process chain KB to define model process chain KD which corresponds with proposed process chain KD shown in . The proposed segment K is appended to existing process chain KA to define model process chain KE.

As shown in the proposed segments K and K which were included in the proposed process chains KD and KC respectively are included in solution package SP. The proposed segment K and the proposed segment K each have an operational relationship with a common existing segment existing segment K.

As shown in the proposed segment K which was included in both of the proposed process chains KC and KD is included in solution package SP. The proposed segment K when included in solution package SP has an operational relationship with several of the existing segments. Specifically proposed segment K has an operational relationship with the existing segment K of the existing process chain KA and has an operational relationship with existing segments K and K of the existing process chain KB. As shown in solution package SP is associated with e.g. defines a portion of three different model process chains model process chains KC KD and KE. In this embodiment the model process chain KE is an entirely new process chain that does not correspond with any of the existing process chains or proposed process chains shown in .

In some embodiments the model process chains KC KD and KE with options and or prerequisites related to operational relationships can be defined by a proposed process chain module e.g. proposed process chain module shown in . In some embodiments the model process chains KC KD and KE with options and or prerequisites related to operational relationships can be presented to a user via a user interface defined by a user interface module e.g. user interface module shown in . In some embodiments a solution package different than the solution packages SP and SP shown in can be produced.

The arrows with dotted ends represent entry points to or from an application. In some embodiments the entry points can be an entry points through which one or more portions of the enterprise process is triggered and or through which data can be passed to the enterprise process. In some embodiments the entry points can function as an interface e.g. an external interface . In some embodiments an external application e.g. a third party application that is separate from an application e.g. internal application used to implement the chain segments can interface with one or more of the enterprise processes via an entry point. For example the campaign development enterprise process included in the campaign chain segment can be triggered by a third party application different from an application or platform of the enterprise processes via the entry point. In some embodiments a solution package can be configured to interface with one or more of the enterprise processes via an entry point.

In some embodiments each of the enterprise processes included in can include one or more process steps. A generalized example of an enterprise process with optional process steps and mandatory process steps is described in connection with .

A flow of information between the process steps of enterprise process N is represented by arrows. For example optional process step N is related to mandatory process step N based on a function associated with the optional process step N being configured to process information e.g. data produced by a function of the mandatory process step N. Similarly optional process step N is related to mandatory process step N based on a function associated with the optional process step N being configured to send information e.g. data to a function of the mandatory process step N.

Each of the process steps from the enterprise process N can be referred to by their classification as a mandatory process step or as an optional process step which are types of process steps . For example process step N which is an optional process step and can be referred to as optional process step N.

In this embodiment the mandatory process steps are represented by rectangles with solid lines. In other words representations of the mandatory process steps include rectangles with solid lines. Also the optional process steps are represented by rectangles with dashed lines. In other words representations of the optional process steps include rectangles with dashed lines.

Various combinations of the optional process steps can be combined with e.g. bound to the mandatory process steps to define variants of the enterprise process N. For example process step N can be combined with the mandatory process steps to define a first variant of the enterprise process N and process steps N and N can be combined with the mandatory process steps to define a second variant of the enterprise process. A variant of the enterprise process N that includes only the mandatory process steps can be referred to as standard enterprise process N. These variants of the enterprise process N are not shown in .

In some embodiments the optional process steps can be dependent from the mandatory process steps but not dependent from other optional process steps . For example in some embodiments a variant of the enterprise process N must include all of the mandatory process steps but can include only a subset of the optional process steps . In other words a variant of the enterprise process N can include all of the mandatory process steps and only for example process step N. This variant of the enterprise process be can be operational without the preceding optional process steps process step N and process step N.

The process steps shown in enterprise process N can represent process steps within an enterprise process. For example the process steps of the enterprise process N can be representations of the process steps of a sales order processing enterprise process. Accordingly mandatory process step N can represent a main process step related to creation updating rejecting a sales order etc. and mandatory process step N can represent a process step related to an availability to purchase promise check and or update. Optional process step N can represent an optional credit check process step optional process step N can represent an optional advertising campaign determination step and optional process step N can represent an optional managerial accounting auditing process step. Mandatory process step N can represent a mandatory purchase order request process step and mandatory process step B can represent a mandatory delivery creation process step.

In some embodiments one or more of the process steps shown in existing enterprise N can be configured to function as a background process that is not visible. In other words the process step may neither require an input value from a user nor produce a result that may be visible to a user via for example a user interface. In some embodiments one or more of the process steps shown in existing enterprise N may require user input in order for the process step to be executed. For example a process step from enterprise process N may require an input value from a user so that one or more functions of the process step can be performed. In some embodiments one or more of the process steps shown in enterprise process N can be configured to produce a result that may be visible to a user via for example a user interface. For example a process step from the enterprise process N can be a process step that can produce a result that can be presented to a user via a user interface e.g. a notification via the user interface . As a specific example if the process step is a process step related to a credit check the result may be a credit score associated with a user of the enterprise process N. Although not shown in a proposed process chain can be or can include one or more process steps similar to those included in enterprise process N.
