title: Human-assisted training of automated classifiers
abstract: Many computing scenarios involve the classification of content items within one or more categories. The content item set may be too large for humans to classify, but an automated classifier (e.g., an artificial neural network) may not be able to classify all content items with acceptable accuracy. Instead, the automated classifier may calculate a classification confidence while classifying respective content items. Content items having a low classification confidence may be sent to a human classifier, and may be added, along with the categories identified by the human classifier, to a training set. The automated classifier may then be retrained using the training set, thereby incrementally improving the classification confidence of the automated classifier while conserving the involvement of human classifiers. Additionally, human classifiers may be rewarded for classifying the content items, and the costs of such rewards may be considered while selecting content items for the training set.

Within the field of art many scenarios involve a task of classifying content items into one or more categories such as identifying topics discussed in a message or document objects present in an image or a musical genre associated with a musical recording. These classification tasks may be performed by humans e.g. by presenting the content items to users and receiving the categories identified by the users. These classification tasks may also be performed by an automated classifier e.g. a Bayesian classification network or artificial neural network that is trained to classify content items into categories. This training is often performed e.g. using a sample data set such as a set of content items for which one or more categories have been previously identified. For example an artificial neural network may be provided a set of content items for which the associated categories are known and may therefore adjust the weights of the interconnections among the neurons in order to achieve a correct classification of the content items of the training set into the known categories. The artificial neural network once trained may be invoked to classify additional content items.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

As compared with the use of humans to classify a particular set of content items the use of artificial classifiers may be advantageous e.g. for classifying content items of larger data sets than may be feasibly classified by humans and or for classifying unknown or difficult to classify content items based on the classification principles inherent in the known content items of the training set. In such scenarios the use of humans to perform the classification tasks may not be feasible e.g. the number of content items may simply be too large to be classified by humans or such classification may be too expensive and or inconsistent e.g. human classification may be inconsistent or unpredictable for difficult to classify content items .

However the classification results generated by an artificial classifier may be unacceptably low e.g. if the artificial classifier is presented with content items that are significantly different from those presented in the training set if new categories are developed and or if the logic generated by the training of the artificial neural network happens to be sufficient to classify the content items of the training set but is insufficient for classifying other content items. Such inadequacies may be ameliorated through retraining of the artificial classifier but such retraining often involves the intervention and careful attention of a developer or administrator of the artificial classifier e.g. the selection of a new training set the application of the training regimen and the testing of the retrained artificial classifier .

Presented herein are techniques for training artificial classifiers to classify content items with the involvement of human classifiers. These techniques utilize the capabilities of the human classifiers to develop the automated classifier in order to improve the accurate classification of content items. However the involvement of human classifiers is typically expensive e.g. involving the presentation of a payment or other reward to the human classifiers for their time and skill in performing the classification or simply because the amount of classification that may be performed by such human classifiers is finite and limited . Therefore these techniques are devised to reduce the involvement of the human classifiers in the development of the automated classifier and or to apply the capabilities of such human classifiers to the development of the automated classifier in a manner that maximizes the improvement of the accuracy of the automated classifier.

In accordance with these techniques the automated classifier may be invoked to classify content items of a content set e.g. topics discussed in various documents or messages objects visible in various images or musical genres associated with various musical recordings . However for each classification the automated classifier may also calculate a classification confidence e.g. the reliability of the classification. For example the automated classifier may identify some content items with calculably high reliability e.g. content items that closely resemble a content item in the training set for which categories are known but may identify other content items with calculably low reliability e.g. content items that are highly dissimilar to many content items in the training set or for which the classification of content items in the training set are inconsistent . Content items having a low classification confidence may be selected and provided to human classifiers who may identify one or more categories that are associated with the content item. These human selected classifications of content items may therefore be utilized as a new training set to retrain the automated classifier in order to achieve an accurate classification of the difficult to classify content items. Therefore human involvement may be applied to improve the areas of classification where the automated classifier is demonstrably weak and may therefore achieve a rapid improvement of the accuracy of the automated classifier with minimal human involvement.

Additional variations of these techniques relate to the presentation to human classifiers of a reward e.g. payment of cash or valuable credit for the classification of content items. In these variations the selection of content items may be adjusted to reduce the costs entailed by utilizing the human classifiers. As a first such variation the selection of content items for classification by human classifiers in order to develop a new training set for the automated classifier may be restricted to satisfy a budget constraint such as a total amount of cash that may be allocated for the involvement of human classifiers. As a second such variation different content items may involve different rewards based on the complexity of the classification e.g. a first document may be longer more complex or more difficult to classify than a second document and may therefore involve a larger reward for human classification and the selection of content items may be adjusted to prioritize lower cost content items over higher cost content items. These and other considerations relating to the payment of rewards to human classifiers are discussed as optional variations of the techniques presented herein.

To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects advantages and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.

The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident however that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.

Within the field of computing many scenarios involve a classification of content items into one or more categories. As a first example a set of documents may be received that may fall into various categories of literature such as news items scientific or technical reports fictional or nonfictional stories poetry and reference documents and or may be written in one or more languages. These documents may be classified by evaluating the writing style of the document e.g. based on vocabulary document length sentence length and complexity and formatting . As a second example a set of messages may be received that may discuss one or more topics such as particular individuals organizations locations events or concepts. These messages may be classified by evaluating the content of each message e.g. based on keyword analysis and semantic evaluation such as the identification of proper nouns based on capitalization . As a third example a set of images may depict various objects that may be identified according to various machine vision algorithms. These images may be classified by evaluating various properties of the identified objects e.g. based on biometric measurements that may identify particular individuals . As a fourth example a set of musical recordings may be classified into one or more musical genres e.g. based on tempo time signature identified instruments and musical structure . In these and many other examples a classification is applied to associate a set of content items with a set of categories.

Each of the alternative solutions of may present comparative advantages and comparative disadvantages. A Mechanical Turk solution may be disadvantageous in some scenarios wherein a classification of all content items performed by human classifiers may be infeasible inefficient or inaccurate. As a first example the set of content items may be too voluminous to be classified entirely by human classifiers . For example a classification of messages posted within a social network into one or more topics may be desired but the rate whereby such messages are submitted may considerably outpace the rate at which human classifiers may be utilized to classify such messages. As a second example while a set of human classifiers may be available to classify the content items of a content set it may simply be inefficient to rely on the human classifiers to do so e.g. automated classifiers may be developed and utilized to achieve an equivalently accurate classification at a lower cost. As a third example some content items in the content set may be difficult to classify e.g. it may be desirable to choose only one category for each content item but some content items may appropriately fall within several categories and human classifiers may yield an undesirable range of inconsistent or variable associations with respective categories for one or more content items while an automated classifier may consistently classify such content items in a more consistent manner. For example while classifying a musical recording that spans several musical genres different human classifiers may classify the musical recording into different musical genres and even a single human classifier may vary in the selection of musical genres over time but an automated classifier may compare the musical recording with a set of statistical characteristics representing each musical genre and may logically and consistently choose the musical genre having the highest statistical characterization of the musical recording. In these and other scenarios the use of automated classifiers to perform the classification may be more feasible efficient and or accurate than the use of human classifiers .

However automated classification may also be undesirable in various scenarios. As a first example some content sets may involve a classification that is simply too nuanced complex subjective or ill defined to produce consistent results via automated classification such as the persuasiveness of a logical argument or the artistic skill of an artist evidenced by a painting. As a second example the development of an automated classifier that correctly identifies a large body of content items may be difficult to achieve without significant human intervention. For example the process of training an artificial neural network involves a particular degree of randomness and many such neural networks may be generated that may within an acceptable range of accuracy classify the content items of a training set . However when presented with new content items that are not in the training set a first automated classifier trained in this manner may correctly classify the new content items but a second automated classifier trained in this manner and embodying a different logical process than the first automated classifier may classify the new content items with a much lower degree of accuracy. Therefore a significant amount of monitoring and tweaking of the automated classifier by a developer or administrator may be involved to promote and maintain the accuracy of the automated classifier .

In view of the potential inadequacies of these exemplary scenarios it may be appreciated that hybrid techniques utilizing a combination of automated and human classification may yield more accurate and consistent results. However it may be difficult to devise hybrid techniques that harness both the scalability and consistency of automated classifiers and the more sophisticated and nuanced logic of human classifiers . Additionally it may be desirable to devise a hybrid technique that conserves the attention of human classifiers which may be more expensive more scarce and or less scalable than reliance on automated classifiers .

Presented herein are techniques for a hybrid classification of content items involving an automated classifier that may be adjusted by invoking the classification decisions of human classifiers . According to these techniques it may be possible for an automated classifier to differentiate content items for which a classification into one or more categories may be identified as having a high degree of classification confidence and content items for which the classification into one or more categories may be identified as having a lower degree of classification confidence. In contrast with the former content items the latter set of content items may identify an area of classification in which the automated classifier is weak inconsistent or uninformed.

In order to improve the weakness in the capabilities of an automated classifier in classifying such content items an embodiment of these techniques may rely upon human classifiers to supplement and improve such capabilities. For example for content items having a low classification confidence e.g. a calculated metric that falls below a classification confidence threshold the embodiment may send such content items to one or more human classifiers for classification . The results of such human mediated classification may be utilized as a training set and the automated classifier may be retrained using this training set . At the completion of the training using these content items the automated classifier may exhibit additional strength and improved classification confidence in these former areas of weakness. Additional instances of retraining may be performed to achieve additional improvements in other areas of classification until the automated classifier is capable of classifying content items within the entire scope of the content set with an acceptable classification confidence and accuracy.

Still another embodiment involves a computer readable medium comprising processor executable instructions configured to apply the techniques presented herein. Such computer readable media may include e.g. computer readable storage media involving a tangible device such as a memory semiconductor e.g. a semiconductor utilizing static random access memory SRAM dynamic random access memory DRAM and or synchronous dynamic random access memory SDRAM technologies a platter of a hard disk drive a flash memory device or a magnetic or optical disc such as a CD R DVD R or floppy disc encoding a set of computer readable instructions that when executed by a processor of a device cause the device to implement the techniques presented herein. Such computer readable media may also include as a class of technologies that are distinct from computer readable storage media various types of communications media such as a signal that may be propagated through various physical phenomena e.g. an electromagnetic signal a sound wave signal or an optical signal and in various wired scenarios e.g. via an Ethernet or fiber optic cable and or wireless scenarios e.g. a wireless local area network WLAN such as WiFi a personal area network PAN such as Bluetooth or a cellular or radio network and which encodes a set of computer readable instructions that when executed by a processor of a device cause the device to implement the techniques presented herein.

An exemplary computer readable medium that may be devised in these ways is illustrated in wherein the implementation comprises a computer readable medium e.g. a CD R DVD R or a platter of a hard disk drive on which is encoded computer readable data . This computer readable data in turn comprises a set of computer instructions configured to operate according to the principles set forth herein. In one such embodiment the processor executable instructions may be configured to perform a method of training an automated classifier to classify content items such as the exemplary method of . In another such embodiment the processor executable instructions may be configured to implement a system for training an automated classifier to classify content items such as the exemplary system of . Some embodiments of this computer readable medium may comprise a non transitory computer readable storage medium e.g. a hard disk drive an optical disc or a flash memory device that is configured to store processor executable instructions configured in this manner. Many such computer readable media may be devised by those of ordinary skill in the art that are configured to operate in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

The techniques discussed herein may be devised with variations in many aspects and some variations may present additional advantages and or reduce disadvantages with respect to other variations of these and other techniques. Moreover some variations may be implemented in combination and some combinations may feature additional advantages and or reduced disadvantages through synergistic cooperation. The variations may be incorporated in various embodiments e.g. the exemplary method of and the exemplary system of to confer individual and or synergistic advantages upon such embodiments.

A first aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the scenarios wherein such techniques may be utilized. As a first example these techniques may be applied to classify many types of content items into one or more categories using various properties of the data and metadata comprising the content items . As a first such example the content items may comprise a set of documents that may fall into various categories of literature such as news items scientific or technical reports fictional or nonfictional stories poetry and reference documents and or may be written in one or more languages. As a second such example the content items may comprise a set of messages posted in a social network a chat environment such as instant messaging or a Simple Message Service SMS conversation an email conversation a thread of conversation in a web forum or newsgroup etc. where such messages discuss one or more topics such as particular individuals organizations locations events or concepts. As a third such example the content items may comprise a set of images may depict various objects that may be identified according to various machine vision algorithms such that the images may be classified into categories according to various properties of the identified objects e.g. based on biometric measurements that may identify particular individuals . As a fourth such example the content items may comprise a set of musical recordings to be classified into one or more musical genres e.g. based on tempo time signature identified instruments and musical structure .

As a second example of this first aspect individuals may be utilized as human classifiers through many types of arrangements. As a first such example the individuals may comprise employees or volunteers having a formal relationship with a company organization or group endeavoring to classify the content items . As a second such example the individuals may comprise agents who agree to classify content items in exchange for a reward such as a cash payment credit that may be utilized to acquire goods or services or a bartered exchange of services. As a third such example the individuals may comprise visitors who simply wish to browse the content set e.g. a patron of a music collection may be permitted to download and retrieve a musical recording but only if the patron agrees to perform a classification of the musical recording into one or more musical genres. As a fourth such example the individuals may comprise players in a game that involves the classification of content items e.g. by awarding points for classifications that are consistent with the classifications of other users involving the same content items As a fifth such example the individuals may have no relationship with the content set and may receive no reward but may nevertheless be willing to classify the content items e.g. as part of a voluntary and or humanitarian effort .

As a third example of this first aspect many types of artificial classifiers may be utilized to perform the automated classification of the content items . As a first such example the automated classifier may comprise an automated neural network that incrementally adjusts the weights of various interconnections among its neurons until the output neurons are capable of generating a correct output identifying one or more categories for each content item based on a set of characteristics provided to each input neuron. As a second such example the automated classifier may comprise a Bayesian network that iteratively evaluates the set of content items in the training set to identify according to statistical analyses the properties that classify each content item differentially among two or more subsets of categories and may develop a hierarchy of differentiating factors that correctly pigeonholes each content item into one or more categories . As a third such example the automated classifier may comprise a genetic algorithm may generate a set of entities that logically classify the content items of the training set and may competitively test compare and breed with mutations the logical instructions comprising each entity for a consecutive set of generations with an adaptive pressure that selects the most accurate entities in each generation until an entity that is capable of correctly classifying the content items of the training set with an acceptable range of accuracy is identified. These and other machine learning techniques including combinations of such techniques may be trained and utilized as automated classifiers of the content items of the content set . Those of ordinary skill in the art may select many such scenarios wherein the techniques presented herein may be utilized.

A second aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the manner of selecting content items to be classified by a human classifier . As a first example in accordance with these techniques the content items for which the automated classifier cannot generate a classification with a suitably high classification confidence are selected since selecting content items having a suitably high classification confidence is not likely to result in a significant improvement in the automated classifier and therefore is not an efficient use of the attention of the human classifier . However additional criteria may be used to select such content items . As a first variation such selections may involve a selection for sending to human classifiers of content items having the lowest classification confidences identified by the automated classifier . For example the content items may be ranked according to classification confidence and a subset of a particular size e.g. ten comprising the content items having the having the lowest classification confidences may be selected for inclusion in the training set . As a second variation of this second aspect the content items may be presented to the human classifier in various ways. As a first such example for a content item having a low classification confidence for a particular category e.g. a content item for which a particular category is a close call a human classifier may be presented with the content item and the category and requested to specify whether the content item is associated with the category . As a second such example for a content item having low classification confidences for several or all categories e.g. a content item that is generally difficult to classify a human classifier may be presented with the content item and the entire set of categories and requested to specify with which categories the content item is associated. As a third such example for a category for which many content items have a low classification confidence e.g. a category for which classification criteria are unavailable inaccurate or inconsistent a human classifier may be presented with the category and several content items and requested to select the content items that are strongly associated or strongly not associated with the category . The formulation of these inquiries may serve to improve specific classification weaknesses of the automated classifier .

Conversely and as a second example illustrated in the exemplary scenario of for a particular content item the automated classifier may be unable to classify the content item into any of the categories with a high classification confidence e.g. the content item may be highly dissimilar to the content items included in the training set such as content item B in the exemplary scenario of and or may fall within the borders of several categories such as content item C in the exemplary scenario of . Accordingly for this content item a second classification query may be generated and presented to a human classifier where such classification query requests the human classifier to select the categories that are associated with the content item .

As a third example illustrated in the exemplary scenario of a particular classification of a content item with a particular category may be very low e.g. a close call where the classification confidence is close to zero and may be particularly indicative of a specific classification for which a human classification may be particularly differentially diagnostic. Accordingly for this content item and category a third classification query may be generated and presented to a human classifier where such classification query specifically requests the human classifier to indicate whether the content item is associated with the category . By formulating classification queries targeted in this manner an embodiment may selectively apply the attention of the human classifier to specific types of classification weaknesses of the automated classifier . Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many ways of selecting among the content items while implementing the techniques presented herein.

A third aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the manner of after receiving from a human classifier a set of one or more categories associated with a content item applying the associations identified by the human classifier . As a first variation the automated classifier may be configured to associate respective content items with respective categories having a classification degree e.g. not just a yes or no binary classification but a degree such as this content item is associated 100 with a first category but only 50 with a second category . It may be appreciated that the classification degree is semantically different than the classification confidence e.g. by comparing the statements I am 100 certain that this content item is associated with a degree of 50 to this category and I am only 50 certain that this content item is 100 associated with this category . It may be recognized that such degree based associations are utilized in the field of fuzzy logic and reference to this field may facilitate an understanding of this variation. In scenarios where fuzzy classifications are permitted the classification of content items with categories by a human classifier may be utilized in many ways. For example the content items may be sent for a binary determination by several human classifiers and an association may be established based on the results of such classification in view of the percentages of the binary determinations e.g. if for a particular content item six human classifiers select a particular category but three other human classifiers do not the content item may be associated with the category with a classification degree of 66 . Alternatively or additionally the classifications received from two or more human classifiers of a content item with a particular category may only be included in the training set if a sufficient consensus is achieved among the human classifiers e.g. an embodiment may associate the content item in the training set with the category only if the at least two human classifiers agree on such classification . This variation may restrict the contents of the training set to classifications that are consistently and objectively identified by the human classifiers . Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many ways of applying the associations identified by the human classifiers of content items with categories while implementing the techniques presented herein.

A fourth aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the manner of encouraging the involvement of human classifiers in the classification of content items in order to improve the automated classifier . In some scenarios no such encouragement may be involved e.g. the human classifier may be a developer or administrator of the automated classifier such as an employee of a group utilizing the automated classifier or a volunteer who participates for philosophical reasons. However in other scenarios it may be desirable to encourage the participation of human classifiers or to improve the accuracy of such classifications by providing a reward to a human classifier for classifying content items within categories . As a first variation of this fourth aspect the reward may comprise may types of compensation such as a cash payment credit for goods or services or a bartered exchange e.g. the human classifier may wish to access a particular website and may be granted access to the website in exchange for classifying content items . For example a user may wish to examine the content items of the content set offered by a server e.g. a collection of musical recordings . In exchange for performing classifications of the content items of the content set e.g. classifying the musical recordings into musical genres the server may permit the user to examine preview and or download the content items .

As a second variation of this fourth aspect a reward presented to a human classifier in exchange for classifying a particular content item may be calculated in various ways. In some scenarios identical or equivalent rewards may be presented for classifying content items . Alternatively the reward presented for classifying a first content item may differ from a reward presented for classifying a second content item for various reasons. As a first example respective human classifiers may have a human classifier rating e.g. a predicted proficiency or accuracy with which different human classifiers classify the same content item based e.g. on experience qualifications or past history of evaluations and the reward presented for classifying a particular content item to a human classifier having a higher human classifier rating may be larger than for a human classifier having a lower human classifier rating. As a second example the reward may be calculated proportionally to a training value of the content item in the training set e.g. to the predicted magnitude of improvement of the automated classifier by having an accurate classification of the content item in the training set . For example in the exemplary scenario of a comparatively high training value may be attributed to the classification of the musical artist named Boron Cowpunch with the musical genre named Soul since such classification may improve the accuracy of the automated classifier both in classifying other content items in the category of Soul and in classifying other categories for this content item . As a third example the reward may be calculated inversely proportionally to the classification confidence of the content item identified by the automated classifier for example the classifications for which the automated classifier is least confident e.g. the close call cases may yield significantly useful information about such classifications so a comparatively large reward may be provided to encourage the accurate classification by human classifiers . As a fourth example the reward may be calculated proportionally to a classification complexity of the content item . For example classifying a brief document written in a simple language may be comparatively easy while classifying a lengthy document written in a complicated language such as a technical document may be comparatively difficult and rewards of different magnitudes may be accordingly calculated and provided. Many such factors as well as various mechanics of supply and demand e.g. the comparative scarcity or abundance of human classifiers available to review a particular content item may be evaluated in the calculation of the reward to be presented for such classification .

As a third variation of this fourth aspect the selection of content items may be adjusted in view of the costs in providing associated rewards to the human classifiers . The rewards provided in the reward system may entail a significant cost for the administrators of the automated classifier and this cost may be reduced through particular variations. As a first example it may be desirable to select content items for classification by human classifiers that have comparatively small rewards. For example when considering whether to select a comparatively easy to classify content item or a comparatively difficult to classify content item to a human classifier it may be desirable to send the easier to classify content item in order to reduce the cost of the associated reward even if the difficult to classify content item may be of marginally higher training value. Conversely it may be desirable to select content items for classification by human classifiers that have comparatively large rewards if such rewards are of greater training value and may achieve greater improvement in the automated classifier . For example instead of selecting a large number of content items having small rewards due to a limited training value it may be more advantageous to select a small number of content items having large rewards due to having large training value and in providing large rewards in order to encourage human classifiers to provide highly accurate classification thereof.

As a second example of this third variation the rewards offered for training the automated classifier may be restricted to a reward limit e.g. a training budget in order to assign a cap to the costs of the training. Therefore an embodiment of these techniques may be configured to select for sending to human classifier a set of content items for which the reward total comprising the sum of the rewards offered to such human classifiers for classifying such content items does not exceed the reward limit. Additionally if rewards are correlated with training values and the predicted magnitude of improvement of the automated classifier it may be advantageous e.g. to select content items that maximally utilize the reward limit e.g. the training budget in order to achieve the greatest improvement within the training budget.

A fifth aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the algorithm utilized to implement the techniques presented herein. While the other variations discussed herein may relate to the substantive effects of such variations of these techniques it may be appreciated that some algorithms selected for implementing these techniques may present advantages with respect to other algorithms.

As a first variation of this fifth aspect an embodiment of these techniques may be configured to utilize a na ve automated classifier such as an uninitialized or randomly seeded artificial neural network and the involvement of the human classifier may be utilized for the initial training of the automated classifier as well as supplemental training . Alternatively an embodiment of these techniques may be configured to initialize the automated classifier to select at least one category for respective content items e.g. by performing an initial training using a pregenerated training set before involving a human classifier .

As a second variation of this fifth aspect the selection of content items for a training set to be sent to one or more human classifiers may occur in various ways. As a first such example upon identifying a content item having a classification confidence below a classification confidence threshold an embodiment of these techniques may retrain the automated classifier using the content item . Alternatively a set of such content items may be identified e.g. for a portion or an entirety of the content set such as when the training set reaches a particular training set size and used together to retrain the automated classifier . Additionally these content items may be combined with content items from previous trainings of the automated classifier e.g. along with the content items from an initial training and any previous supplemental training in order to ensure that the retraining does not cause the automated classifier to diverge from the initial training set . Alternatively an embodiment of these techniques may be configured to initialize the training set prior to adding the content items and to reinitialize the training set after the training . This variation may lead to a sequence of trainings using different content items which may reduce a deleterious effect of inconsistent or inaccurate content items that may have been present in previous training sets .

As a third variation of this fifth aspect the selection of content items for a training set may be performed once or on an iterative basis where the iterations may continue indefinitely e.g. whenever areas of classification weakness of the automated classifier are identified or until a desired classification confidence is achieved. For example after training the automated classifier an embodiment of these techniques may calculate a classification confidence for the automated classifier e.g. the average of the classification confidence for all content items and or categories and may compare the classification confidence of the automated classifier with a classification confidence threshold e.g. a desired accuracy or proficiency of the automated classifier . If the classification confidence is not below the classification confidence threshold then additional content items may be identified and a retraining of the automated classifier with a training set comprising the additional content items may be performed.
