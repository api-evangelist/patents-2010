title: Method of converting bomblet to gun-launched grenade
abstract: A Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM) bomblet may be converted into a gun-launched grenade. The bomblet may include a fuze, a shaped-charge liner, a casing, and explosive material disposed between the shaped-charge liner and the casing. An ogive may be attached to an open end of the bomblet. A generally cup-shaped pusher may be placed over the fuze and attached to the bomblet casing. A conventional cartridge case assembly may be fixed to a fuze end of the bomblet. When the gun-launched grenade impacts a target, the casing may shatter to form shrapnel and a shaped-charge jet may be formed.

The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

Some large gun launched projectiles such as 155 mm projectiles may carry many submunitions or bomblets that may be expelled in flight. Each bomblet may be independently stablized and armed. One type of bomblet may include a point detonating fuze that detonates the bomblet on impact. Detonation of the bomblet may send anti personnel fragments radially and may send a shaped charge jet downward. A large number of gun launched projectiles that contain bomblets may no longer be used. Thus there may be millions of surplus bomblets.

If the surplus bomblets are destroyed the large original capital investment in the bomblets will be lost. And the process of de militarizing the bomblets is an another large cost. A need exists for a cost effective method of converting surplus bomblets into useful products.

It is an object of the invention to provide a cost effective method for converting surplus bomblets into useful products.

One aspect of the invention is a method of converting a bomblet into a gun launched grenade. The bomblet may include a fuze a shaped charge liner a casing and explosive material disposed between the shaped charge liner and the casing. The method may include attaching an ogive to an open end of the bomblet. A generally cup shaped pusher may be placed over the fuze. The pusher may be attached to the casing. A cartridge case assembly may be attached to the fuze end of the bomblet.

The pusher may include a driving band. Attaching the pusher may include press fitting the pusher to the casing. Attaching the cartridge case assembly may include mechanically crimping the cartridge case assembly to the pusher.

Another aspect of the invention is an alternative method of converting a bomblet into a gun launched grenade. The bomblet may include a fuze a shaped charge liner a casing and explosive material disposed between the shaped charge liner and the casing. The method may include removing the fuze from the bomblet. A generally cup shaped pusher may be placed over the fuze end of the bomblet. The pusher may be attached to the casing. A spit back fuze may be attached to an open end of the bomblet. A cartridge case assembly may be attached to the fuze end of the bomblet.

The pusher may include a driving band. Attaching the pusher may include press fitting the pusher to the casing. Attaching the cartridge case assembly may include mechanically crimping the cartridge case assembly to the pusher. The spit back fuze may include a housing with a generally hemispherical nose.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

A known Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition DPICM bomblet may be converted into a gun launched grenade. The gun launched grenade may be fired from for example 40 mm gun tubes. The process of converting the known DPICM bomblet into a gun launched grenade may be about 30 to 60 cheaper than purchasing a new gun launched grenade.

A method of converting bomblet into a gun launched grenade may include fixing an ogive over open end of bomblet . Ogive may have a generally hemispherical nose . Ogive may be made of for example a polymer. Ogive may be fixed to casing using for example glue. A pusher may be placed over fuze . Pusher may be generally cup shaped. Pusher may include a ledge that abuts shoulder of casing . Pusher may be made of for example a polymer or ceramic material. Pusher may be press fit to casing . Adhesive may be used to fix pusher to casing .

A driving band may be used to impart spin to gun launched grenade . Driving band may be formed integral with or separate from pusher . In some embodiments driving band may be made of copper. A conventional cartridge case assembly such as an M118 cartridge case may be mechanically crimped to pusher . Cartridge case assembly may include a primer and propellant .

Grenade may be launched from a weapon with a 40 mm caliber gun tube. Propellant may propel pusher and casing out of the gun tube. Upon exit from the gun tube pusher may separate from casing . Arming of fuze may occur via air flow interaction with ribbon stabilizer and the spinning of grenade . Upon impact fuze may detonate explosive material . Explosive material may shatter casing to form shrapnel. A shaped charge jet may be formed by the action of explosive material and shaped charge liner .

In another embodiment of the invention bomblet may be converted into a gun launched grenade . To convert bomblet into gun launched grenade fuze may be removed from bomblet . Fuze may be removed by milling staked material and lifting fuze from bomblet . A pusher may be placed over the fuze end of bomblet . Pusher may be generally cup shaped. Pusher may include a ledge that abuts shoulder of casing .

Pusher may be made of for example a polymer or ceramic material. Pusher may be press fit to casing . Adhesive may be used to fix pusher to casing . A driving band may be used to impart spin. Driving band may be formed integral with or separate from pusher . In some embodiments driving band may be made of copper.

A conventional cartridge case assembly such as an M118 cartridge case may be mechanically crimped to pusher . Cartridge case assembly may include a primer and propellant . A conventional 40 mm spit back fuze may include a housing having a generally hemi spherical nose. Fuze may be placed over open end of bomblet . Fuze may be fixed to casing using for example glue.

Gun launched grenade may function similar to gun launched grenade . In grenade spit back fuze may detonate explosive material .

While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
