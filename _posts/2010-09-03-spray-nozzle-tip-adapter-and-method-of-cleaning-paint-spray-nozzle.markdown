This invention relates to an adapter for cleaning a paint spray nozzle in an environmentally friendly and effective method. More particularly the invention is for a device and method for cleaning typical paint spray nozzles having usual male type inlets by propelling pressurized liquid solvent through the nozzles instead of the usual practice of cleaning or attempting to clean the nozzles by using gaseous aerosol from the container of the paint product.

Paint nozzles from aerosol spray paint cans are commonly cleaned or cleared of residual paint product material by inverting the aerosol paint can depressing the nozzle for pressurized release activation and holding the nozzle depressed for at least three or more seconds while aerosol propellant passes through the nozzle. This action is continued until the operator perceives a cleaned nozzle by sight sound or time or assumes that the paint nozzle is sufficiently clean. At minimum large amounts of propellant are expelled into the atmosphere along with some quantity of paint. Often however large amounts of paint product are also expelled with the aerosol because of various reasons including overfill of paint failure to hold the can fully inverted location of the internal tube of the nozzle below the inside surface of paint or paint being drawn by air flow into the internal tube. Consequently the paint spray nozzle often is not fully cleaned or not cleaned at all and nothing has been gained by this type cleaning procedure.

The propellant often used today is carbon dioxide but by today s standards carbon dioxide is considered by many to be an environmental hazard or greenhouse gas. Because manufacturers anticipate the excessive discharge of propellant during the previously described cleaning procedure the aerosol paint cans are additionally over charged with propellant such that the user will not become frustrated with insufficient propellant. The excessive discharged propellant is considered to be unnecessarily polluting to the environment.

Thus in accordance with this inventive concept a need has been recognized in the state of the art for a spray tip nozzle adapter for cleaning typical paint spray nozzles having usual male type inlets by propelling pressurized liquid solvent through the nozzles.

The present invention provides a spray nozzle tip adapter and method for cleaning paint spray nozzles and has a rigid body member having an inlet port on one side an exit port on another side a passage connecting the inlet port and the exit port and a cupped contact surface on the rigid body member for exerting compressive force. The rigid body member is formed in an L shape and the passage is formed in an internal L shape including a ninety degree angle between the inlet port and the exit port. The inlet port has an outer annular portion and a smaller inner annular portion. This sizing permits the outer and inner annular portions to frictionally engage differently sized dispensing tubes of pressurized liquid solvent cans in a sealed relationship. The exit port has an annular exit portion shaped and sized to frictionally engage and retain a tubular inlet of a spray paint nozzle in a sealed relationship. The passage has a tapered region of tapered diameter that is connected to the annular exit portion of the exit port to frictionally engage and retain a tubular inlet of a spray paint nozzle in a sealed relationship.

The method of cleaning a paint spray nozzle calls for inserting the stem of a fouled paint spray nozzle into an exit port of a spray nozzle tip adapter. Next inserting the solvent dispensing tube of a can of pressurized liquid solvent into an inlet port of a spray nozzle tip adapter allows pushing the spray nozzle tip adapter onto the solvent dispensing tube and propelling liquid solvent through a passage in the spray nozzle tip adapter to clean fouling from the paint spray nozzle.

An object of the invention is to provide an apparatus to utilize commercially available pressurized liquid solvents propelled through usual male type dispensing tubes to clean paint spray nozzles.

Another object of the invention is to provide an apparatus allowing secure connection to a solvent dispensing tube of a container of pressurized liquid solvent to dispense solvent through the dispensing tube in the usual way to dispense solvent.

Another object of the invention is to provide an apparatus allowing secure connection to a solvent dispensing tube of a container of pressurized liquid solvent to dispense the solvent at a desired angle and flow to clean paint spray nozzles.

Another object of the invention is to provide a spray nozzle tip adapter directing gas pressurized liquid solvents from usual male type dispensing tubes through typical paint spray nozzles having usual male type inlets in a safe and controlled manner to clean the spray nozzles.

Another object of the invention is to provide a spray nozzle tip adapter directing pressurized liquid solvents to thoroughly clean paint spray nozzles and make them free of residual paint and prevent clogging from dried paint during future use.

Another object of the invention is to provide a spray nozzle tip adapter directing gas pressure propelled liquid solvents to clean paint spray nozzles that allows capture of a small volume of released paint and solvent as a liquid into a waste container or rag for disposal in a more environmentally friendly manner than contemporary methods that release paint and propellant as vapor mist or droplets into the gaseous atmosphere where they are harder to capture and reclaim.

Another object of the invention is to provide a spray nozzle tip adapter directing gas pressurized propelled liquid solvents to clean paint spray nozzles to prevent spraying aerosol propellant and paint into the atmosphere.

Another object of the invention is to provide a spray nozzle tip adapter directing gas pressurized propelled liquid solvents to more effectively clean and prepare fouled paint nozzles such that the paint products work more effectively and are more resource efficient i.e. with better more consistent results with less rework and less waste.

Another object of the invention is to provide a spray nozzle tip adapter directing pressurized propelled liquid solvents to clean paint spray nozzles allowing use of many different available dispensing tubes of solvents.

These and other objects of the invention will become more readily apparent from the ensuing specification when taken in conjunction with the appended claims.

Referring to a spray nozzle tip adapter of the invention is shown cleaning paint fouling from a typical paint spray nozzle . Gas pressurized cans of paint having standardized paint spray nozzles are widely known and universally used to apply paint on nearly any surface needing painting. Immediately after use however the nozzle must be cleaned of residual paint or the paint residue will dry in place to obstruct the nozzle and make it useless.

A typical paint spray nozzle has a substantially cylindrical body that positions a nozzle end for discharging an aerosol paint spray to the side via a central aerosol duct extending through an annular shoulder and a central cylindrical male type inlet . Spray nozzle tip adapter propelling pressurized liquid solvent from a can of pressurized liquid solvent through paint spray nozzle is far more effective and efficient for cleaning paint residue as compared to the usual practice of attempting to clean paint fouled nozzles with gaseous aerosol from the paint container itself.

Spray nozzle tip adapter has a rounded elongate L shaped rigid plastic or metal body member . Body member has an L shaped internal passage having an inlet port and exit port at its opposite ends. Referring also to inlet port is shaped and sized to fit over and frictionally engage liquid dispensing tube or of liquid solvent can in a sealed relationship. Dispensing tube is a simple male type having essentially a tubular shape with a coaxial solvent exit duct and dispensing tube is a complex male type having a tapered or variable diameter outside surface and a coaxial solvent exit duct . Internal L shaped passage connects and provides a sealed flow passage for pressurized solvent from either duct or between inlet port and exit port of spray nozzle tip adapter .

Referring also to exit port has an annular exit portion of exit diameter N sized to receive and frictionally engage and retain central tubular inlet of paint spray nozzle in a sealed relationship. A short bevel or similar tapered or stepped passage geometry may be provided around the entrance to both inlet and exit ports and no bevel or stepped passage geometry being depicted around inlet port . These geometries can assist with connecting guiding the inlet and exit ports and onto the respective solvent dispensing tube or of can and central inlet of paint spray nozzle . A raised finger cupped contact surface on the outside of body member is centered over inlet port and part of passage to assist with an operator s downward pushing by finger F to exert a force F substantially parallel to solvent dispensing tube or and frictionally engage inlet port of spray nozzle tip adapter onto dispensing tube or of solvent can . Finger contact surface also aids further pushing down upon solvent dispensing tube or to activate solvent can to dispense pressurized liquid solvent into passage .

Inlet port is shaped with an outer annular portion having an internal diameter sized to tightly fit and seal some larger diameter size solvent dispensing tubes or of cans . Inlet port also is provided with an inner annular portion having a smaller internal diameter than outer annular portion . This structure permits a smaller diameter dispensing tube or to be inserted into inlet port to frictionally engage and create a second seal when contact with the top of tube or is made with inner portion and or a first annular shoulder between outer and inner portions and . The inside diameters of the inner and outer annular portions and are preferably larger than the diameter of passage . Either inner or outer annular portions or or both of inlet port can optionally be provided with a well known ring like resilient lock protrusion surface not shown extending radially inwardly to mate with a lock groove A on complex dispensing tube to frictionally lock tube in inlet port . Exerting further force of contact in the downward direction by depression of the finger cupped contact surface results in release of pressurized liquid solvent from can through exit ducts or of tubes or and into passage .

Similarly inner annular portion has an internal diameter to tightly fit and seal some smaller diameter size dispensing tubes or of cans . Upon contact of smaller internal diameter inner annular portion and or a second annular shoulder created around internal passageway adjacent inner portion yet another seal can be made with the contact of the top of solvent dispensing tubes or . Again exerting further force of contact in the downward direction by depression of finger cupped contact surface activates can to release propelled solvent in the normal way which enters internal passage of spray nozzle tip adapter . The forceful depression also seals the juncture between the solvent dispensing tube and the inner and outer portions of the inlet port to avoid blow by of propelled liquid solvent. In this fashion the spray tip nozzle tip adapter fits onto and operates in conjunction with multiple size types of liquid solvent cans .

Passage has a first diameter of P to enable the released liquid solvent to enter and flow inward where it makes an angle turn normally 90 degrees . Passage can have a second diameter of P downstream of the angle turn to help control the rate at which propelled solvent then flows into annular exit portion of outlet port . Diameters P and P of passage are selectively sized to both limit restrict flow of solvent and to provide passage to a tapered region of tapered exit diameter T in body member .

Tapered region provides mating and smooth transition of the internal passage having diameter P to exit diameter N of annular exit portion of exit port . Exit diameter N is sized to receive and frictionally retain inlet of paint spray nozzle in a snug frictional sealed engagement in exit port . This snug engagement holds inlet in place and enables pressurized liquid solvent to be propelled from a can of pressurized liquid solvent and through paint spray nozzle during its cleaning.

To iterate this point inlet of paint spray nozzle to be cleaned is inserted with force into annular exit portion of exit port and tapered region . Both diameter N of exit port and tapered diameter T are sized to tightly fit on inlet and therefore seal the outer diameter of inlet in exit port of spray tip nozzle adapter . Further forceful insertion of inlet of paint spray nozzle causes the end of inlet to further be pressed into contact with the smaller diameter T of tapered region in body member and creates a second tighter seal that also holds paint spray nozzle in place and avoids blow by of propelled liquid solvent . Once paint spray nozzle is fitted into annular exit portion of exit port and or into tapered region nozzle end of paint spray nozzle can be rotated to any desired orientation. A preferred orientation for safe cleaning is most likely to be with nozzle end of paint nozzle pointing downward. Dispensed solvent and waste paint can be captured directly into a waste container or cloth rag for environmentally friendly disposal.

Paint spray nozzle tip adapter can be used to clean other than paint spray nozzles such as other product dispensing straws tubes that can be inserted and sealed in the tapered region to propel solvent through in the usual manner. This is because the design of relatively long tapered region seals and holds a clean or fouled dispensing tube more securely than a relatively short straight exit diameter. In addition spray nozzle tip adapter can be used with a can of pressurized liquid solvent in inlet port and a paint spray nozzle in exit port to dispense a spray of solvent through nozzle when such a spray is needed.

Paint spray nozzle adapter seals more than one size of simple and complex male dispensing tubes and of cans in inlet port to male type inlet tubes in exit port . This allows use of spray tip nozzle adapter with many currently available dispensing tubes for cans of liquid solvent. In addition to perimeter sealing surfaces within spray tip nozzle adapter secondary sealing surfaces are provided where reduced diameters are internally provided. For example secondary sealing surfaces are formed on the inner diameter surface for both inner portion and first annular shoulder the inner diameter surface for outer portion and second annular shoulder and the tapered inner diameter surface for tapered region and inner diameter surface of annular exit portion of exit port .

Spray nozzle tip adapter provides a typically horizontal exit flow direction for propelled liquid solvent to prevent any unrestricted solvent flow that might possibly be directed toward the user s eyes. By virtue of length turn taper and diameter of all passages the solvent flow rate is at safer manageable amounts and uncontrolled flow rates are avoided.

Spray nozzle tip adapter is not restricted to the specific arrangement referred to above but can be modified in accordance with this inventive concept to assure superior cleaning of paint spray nozzles and other tubes and to dispense solvent. It can have the inlet and exit ports as described but can be modified to deviate from the angle of the L shape described above and or can have a shorter tubular shape of as small as 0.3 inch with a straight through passage of uniform or non uniform diameter of as small as 0.125 inch. It might also be modified to do away with the tapered diameter portion or may have any combination of the features described above so long as the modified design of spray nozzle tip adapter seals and feeds propelled liquid solvents to and through typical paint spray nozzles in a safe and controlled manner to clean them of residual paint and not be clogged by dried paint.

The disclosed components and their arrangements as disclosed herein all contribute to the novel features of this invention. Therefore spray nozzle tip adapter as disclosed herein is not to be construed as limiting but rather is intended to be demonstrative of this inventive concept.

It should be readily understood that many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible within the purview of the claimed invention. It is to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.
