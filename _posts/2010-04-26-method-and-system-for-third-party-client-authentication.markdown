Authentication servers are used to authenticate clients that wish to access various services or applications. In conventional systems having authentication servers the client presents a particular set of credentials such as username and password to the authentication server. One approach is for the authentication server to validate the presented credentials against system s internal store to authenticate the client s identity. This approach has the drawback that the systems must store user credentials of the client.

Another approach is to delegate authentication to a trusted third party authenticator which does not require the systems to store user credentials. In some existing systems for third party authentication the authentication server merely sends the set of credentials to the third party authenticator and receives a confirmation or rejection of authentication. In using such a system difficulties arise when dealing with many different possible third party authenticators each supporting numerous credential types. For example it may be redundant and unnecessarily complex to create a specific system pluggable authentication module for each credential for each third party authenticator.

Other difficulties with existing systems will be appreciated in view of the detailed description hereinbelow.

Example embodiments described herein relate to third party authentication of clients which includes a client sending a selected credential type of a third party authenticator to an authentication server.

In an example embodiment there is provided a method for third party authentication of a client including displaying a user interface on a display of the client the user interface including an option to select a supported credential type of a third party authentication server receiving a command selecting the supported credential type and sending credential information and the selected supported credential type to an authentication server for third party authentication by the third party authentication server.

In another example embodiment there is provided a client the client including one or more controllers for controlling operation of the client a display for displaying a user interface the user interface including an option to select a supported credential type of a third party authentication server an input device for receiving a command selecting the supported credential type and a communication subsystem for sending credential information and the selected supported credential type to an authentication server for third party authentication by the third party authentication server.

In yet another example embodiment there is provided a method for third party authentication of a client the method being performed by an authentication server including requesting from a module associated with a third party authentication server supported credential types of said third party authentication server receiving said supported credential types and sending to the client an identification of the supported credential types.

In yet another example there is provided an authentication server for third party authentication of a client including a controller configured for requesting from a module associated with a third party authentication server supported credential types of said third party authentication server receiving said supported credential types and sending to the client an identification of the supported credential types.

In example embodiments third party authenticators may also be referred to as external authenticators.

Reference is made to which shows in block diagram form a communication system in which example embodiments according to the present disclosure may be applied. The communication system comprises a number of mobile communication devices mobile devices which may be connected to the remainder of system in any of several different ways. Accordingly several instances of mobile devices are depicted in as employing different example ways of connecting to system . Mobile devices are connected to a wireless communication network which may comprise one or more of a Wireless Wide Area Network WWAN a Wireless Local Area Network WLAN or any other suitable network arrangements. In some embodiments the mobile devices are configured to communicate over both the WWAN and WLAN and to roam between these networks. In some embodiments the wireless network may comprise multiple WWANs and WLANs .

The WWAN may be implemented as any suitable wireless access network technology. By way of example but not limitation the WWAN may be implemented as a wireless network that includes a number of base stations one of which is shown in each containing radio transmitting and receiving equipment adapted to provide wireless radio frequency RF network service or coverage to a corresponding area or cell. The WWAN is typically operated by a mobile network service provider that provides subscription packages to users of the mobile devices . The WWAN may be implemented as any appropriate wireless network including but not limited to any to one or more of the following wireless network types Mobitex Radio Network DataTAC GSM Global System for Mobile Communication GPRS General Packet Radio System TDMA Time Division Multiple Access CDMA Code Division Multiple Access CDPD Cellular Digital Packet Data iDEN integrated Digital Enhanced Network EvDO Evolution Data Optimized CDMA2000 EDGE Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution UMTS Universal Mobile Telecommunication Systems HSPDA High Speed Downlink Packet Access IEEE 802.16e also referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or WiMAX . Other network types and technologies could also be used. Although WWAN is described as a Wide Area network that term is intended herein also to incorporate wireless Metropolitan Area Networks WMAN and other similar technologies for providing coordinated service wirelessly over an area larger than that covered by typical WLANs.

A wireless network gateway may be associated with the WWAN to connect the mobile devices to transport facilities and through the transport facilities to a wireless connector system . Transport facilities may include one or more private networks or lines the public internet a virtual private network or any other suitable network. The wireless connector system may be operated for example by an organization or enterprise such as a corporation university or governmental department which allows access to a network such as an internal or enterprise network and its resources or the wireless connector system may be operated by a mobile network provider. In some embodiments the network may be realized using the Internet rather than an internal or enterprise network.

The wireless network gateway provides an interface between the wireless connector system and the WWAN which facilitates communication between the mobile devices and other devices not shown connected directly or indirectly to the WWAN . Accordingly communications sent via the mobile devices are transported via the WWAN and the wireless network gateway through transport facilities to the wireless connector system . Communications sent from the wireless connector system are received by the wireless network gateway and transported via the WWAN to the mobile devices .

The WLAN comprises a wireless network which in some embodiments conforms to IEEE 802.11x standards sometimes referred to as Wi Fi such as for example any or all of the IEEE 802.11a 802.11b 802.11g or 802.11n standards. Other communication protocols may be used for the WLAN in other embodiments such as for example IEEE 802.16e also referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or WIMAX or IEEE 802.20 also referred to as Mobile Wireless Broadband Access . The WLAN includes one or more wireless RF Access Points AP one of which is shown in that collectively provide WLAN service or coverage over an area.

The WLAN may be a personal network of the user an enterprise network or a hotspot offered by an internet service provider ISP a mobile network provider or a property owner in a public or semi public area for example. The access points are connected to an access point AP interface which may connect to the wireless connector system directly for example if the access point is part of an enterprise WLAN in which the wireless connector system resides or indirectly via the transport facilities if the access point is a personal Wi Fi network or Wi Fi hotspot in which case a mechanism for securely connecting to the wireless connector system such as a virtual private network VPN may be required . The AP interface provides translation and routing services between the access points and the wireless connector system to facilitate communication directly or indirectly with the wireless connector system .

The wireless connector system may be implemented as one or more servers and is typically located behind a firewall . The wireless connector system manages communications including e mail messages to and from a set of managed mobile devices . The wireless connector system also provides administrative control and management capabilities over users and mobile devices which may connect to the wireless connector system .

The wireless connector system typically provides a secure exchange of data e.g. e mail messages personal information manager PIM data and IM data with the mobile devices . In some embodiments communications between the wireless connector system and the mobile devices are encrypted.

The network may comprise a private local area network metropolitan area network wide area network the public internet or combinations thereof and may include virtual networks constructed using any of these alone or in combination.

A mobile device may alternatively connect to the wireless connector system using a computer such as desktop or notebook computer via the network . A link may be provided for exchanging information between the mobile device and computer connected to the wireless connector system . The link may comprise one or both of a physical interface and short range wireless communication interface. The physical interface may comprise one or combinations of an Ethernet connection Universal Serial Bus USB connection Firewire also known as an IEEE 1394 interface connection a conventional serial protocol or any other appropriate data connection via respective ports or interfaces of the mobile device and computer . The short range wireless communication interface may be a personal area network PAN interface. A personal area network is a wireless point to point connection meaning no physical cables are required to connect the two end points. The short range wireless communication interface may comprise one or a combination of an infrared IR connection such as an Infrared Data Association IrDA connection a short range radio frequency RF connection such as one specified by IEEE 802.15.1 sometimes referred to as BLUETOOTH or IEEE 802.15.3a also referred to as UltraWideband UWB or any other appropriate PAN connection.

The wireless communication subsystem includes one or more communication systems for communicating with wireless WAN base stations and wireless LAN access points within the wireless network . The particular design of the wireless communication subsystem depends on the wireless network in which mobile device is intended to operate. The mobile device may send and receive communication signals over the wireless network after the required network registration or activation procedures have been completed.

The processor operates under stored program control and executes software modules stored in memory such as persistent memory or ROM . ROM may contain data program instructions or both. Persistent memory may contain data program instructions or both in some embodiments is rewritable under control of processor and may be realized using any appropriate persistent memory technology including EEPROM EAROM FLASH and the like. As illustrated in the software modules comprise operating system software and software applications .

Software modules or parts thereof may be temporarily loaded into volatile memory such as the RAM . The RAM is used for storing runtime data variables and other types of data or information as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Although specific functions are described for various types of memory this is merely one example and those skilled in the art will appreciate that a different assignment of functions to types of memory could also be used.

The software applications may further include a range of applications including for example an e mail messaging application address book calendar application notepad application Internet browser application voice communication i.e. telephony application mapping application or a media player application or any combination thereof.

In some embodiments the auxiliary input output I O subsystems may comprise an external communication link or interface for example an Ethernet connection. The auxiliary I O subsystems may further comprise one or more input devices including a pointing or navigational tool such as a clickable trackball or scroll wheel or thumbwheel or one or more output devices including a mechanical transducer such as a vibrator for providing vibratory notifications in response to various events on the mobile device e.g. receipt of an electronic message or incoming phone call or for other purposes such as haptic feedback touch feedback .

The mobile device also includes a battery which furnishes energy for operating the mobile device . The battery may be coupled to the electrical circuitry of mobile device through a battery interface which may manage such functions as charging the battery from an external power source not shown and the distribution of energy to various loads within or connected to the mobile device . Short range communication subsystem is an additional optional component which provides for communication between the mobile device and different systems or devices which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example the short range communication subsystem may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components or a wireless bus protocol compliant communication mechanism such as a BLUETOOTH communication module to provide for communication with similarly enabled systems and devices.

In some embodiments the mobile device also includes one or more removable memory modules typically comprising FLASH memory and one or more memory module interfaces . Among possible functions of the removable memory module is to store information used to identify or authenticate a user or the user s account to wireless network . For example in conjunction with certain types of wireless networks including GSM and successor networks the removable memory module includes a Subscriber Identity Module or SIM . The memory module is inserted in or connected to the memory module interface of the mobile device in order to operate in conjunction with the wireless network . In example embodiments the SIM acts as a smart card containing stored credential information for authentication of the mobile device .

The mobile device stores data in a persistent memory . In various embodiments the data includes stored credential information such as personal identification number PIN as is understood in the art to be sent from the mobile device for third party authentication. Further in example embodiments the RAM may temporarily store a token to be used as credential information described in greater detail herein. The token may be a SPNEGO Simple and Protected GSSAPI Negotiation Mechanism token as is understood in the art.

A predetermined set of applications that control basic device operations including data and possibly voice communication applications will normally be installed on the mobile device during or after manufacture. Additional applications and or upgrades to the operating system software or software applications may also be loaded onto the mobile device through the wireless network the auxiliary I O subsystem the data port the short range communication subsystem or other suitable subsystem such as . The downloaded programs or code modules may be permanently installed for example written into the program memory e.g. the persistent memory or written into and executed from the RAM for execution by the processor at runtime.

The mobile device may provide two principal modes of communication a data communication mode and an optional voice communication mode. In the data communication mode a received data signal such as a text message an e mail message Web page download or an image file will be processed by the wireless communication subsystem and input to the processor for further processing. For example a downloaded Web page may be further processed by a browser application or an e mail message may be processed by an e mail message messaging application and output to the display . A user of the mobile device may also compose data items such as e mail messages for example using the input devices in conjunction with the display . These composed items may be transmitted through the wireless communication subsystem over the wireless network . In the voice communication mode the mobile device provides telephony functions and operates as a typical cellular phone.

Referring again to the wireless connector system allows the mobile devices to access the network and connected resources and one or more remote services each or collectively . The services may include one or more enterprise services e.g. one shown as enterprise service and one or more Internet services e.g. shown as secure Internet service . Additional services may include unsecure Internet services which are not described herein as they typically are not involved in authentication. Generally the services may include one or more authentication servers may also be referred to as authentication services or modules which facilitate authentication of the mobile device by communicating with third party authentication servers each or collectively . Once a mobile device is authenticated the service provides access to various associated applications and services.

The services may also communicate with other the application servers not shown for the provision of these applications and services. Briefly the enterprise service may for example include an e mail messaging server implementing Microsoft EXCHANGE IBM LOTUS DOMINO or Novell GROUPWISE. Some such servers are also referred to as groupware servers. The secure Internet service may be configured for implementing applications such as instant messaging IM applications e mail such as web based e mail voice mails appointments task items and calendar events. The secure Internet service may also include a content server for providing content such as internet content or content from an organization s internal servers to the mobile devices in the wireless network . Although services are depicted in as implemented via discrete servers the services may be distributed or integrated over any appropriate number and topology of servers.

Referring still to the third party authentication servers may be provided by third party providers which are independently operated and typically hosted remotely from the services . By way of example only third party authentication server is of type Active Directory R third party authentication server is of type Domino and third party authentication server is of type Groupwise as is understood in the art. As shown in the third party authentication servers are shown in direct communication with services for ease of reference however in many embodiments the authentication servers may in fact communicate through network .

The wireless network gateway is configured to send data packets received from the mobile device over the WWAN to the wireless connector system . The wireless connector system then sends the data packets to the appropriate connection point such as the services . Conversely the wireless connector system sends data packets received for example from the services to the wireless network gateway which then transmits the data packets to the destination mobile device . The AP interfaces of the WLAN provide similar sending functions between the mobile device the wireless connector system and network connection point such as the services . In further example embodiments a user may concurrently or alternatively access the services through computer .

A difficulty with existing conventional third party authenticator systems is that there may be many different third party authenticators each being able to support multiple credential types. For example it may be redundant and unnecessarily complex to create a specific pluggable external authentication module plug in for each credential for each third party authenticator.

In many existing conventional systems having pluggable external authentication modules the pluggable external authentication module merely sends or relays the provided credential information to the identified third party authentication server without any consideration of the credential type or types which may be supported by the third party authentication server.

In example embodiments there is provided pluggable external authentication modules each of which may support one or more credential types of third party authentication servers . Referring briefly to for example Active Directory can for example support credential types of password and single sign on while Domino and Groupwise can for example support credential type of password only. Other possible supported credential types in accordance with example embodiments are smart card e.g. SIM and PIN. A user interface is provided on the client device to display the available third party authenticators and their respective credential types. Clients can receive selection of the appropriate authenticator and credential type and send the appropriate credentials to the authentication server . An application of the authentication server can transparently delegate the authentication request to the responsible pluggable external authentication module. The pluggable external authentication module can then choose the appropriate authentication method to perform authentication on the client credentials based upon the selected credential type.

Reference is now made to which shows a flow diagram of a detail communication between a client system a service including an authentication server and a third party authentication server in accordance with an example embodiment. The authentication server includes a controller and a memory containing modules for operation thereof. The third party authentication server includes a domain controller as is understood in the art for controlling operation thereof. As shown the client system acts as a client and may include a client device e.g. mobile device or suitable computer terminal and or a client server .

Referring again to the applications may include a security manager for facilitating the authentication functions described herein. In some example embodiments the security manager merely acts as a platform which communicates with the client server wherein the client server provides most of the functionality for the login process. The client server may for example include an API application programming interface client or web service as is understood in the art. This may be implemented by the mobile device within a typical web browser such as Internet Explorer Mozilla Firefox Safari etc. as is understood in the art. This may be referred to as a thin client system. In other example embodiments the security manager of the client device itself provides the bulk of the functionality such as session control ticket exchanging etc. as would be understood in the art. In such an embodiment the client server may merely act as a relay or may not be present at all. This may be referred to as a fat client system or thick client system.

Again referring to the flow diagram will now be described in greater detail. In example embodiments the client system and authentication server are configured to send receive and or process a credential type data object. This credential type may for example be a parameter data transfer object flag data structure or other type of data object. The credential type is the particular credential type supported by a particular third party authentication server . At process the client system requests the identification of the available third party authenticator servers and the identification of their respective supported credential types. At process the authentication server queries all third party authentication servers for their supported credentials types this may be performed via or entirely by a pluggable external authentication module . In this example only one third party authenticator is shown for illustration purposes. As illustrated by supported credential types the third party authenticator in this example may include but are not limited to password Single Sign On SSO SIM and PIN. At process these supported credential types are sent to the authentication server . At process the authentication server sends the supported credential types of each third party authenticator to the client server .

At this stage the client device may display a user interface which includes a list of at least one of the supported credential types of the third party authentication server and an option to select the at least one of the supported credential types . Upon receiving selection of the supported credential types at process the client system sends login context information including the appropriate credential information and the selected credential type as well as appropriate authenticator identifiers to the authentication server . As shown the credential information may include password token for SSO SIM or PIN. For example referring to SIM may be accessed or retrieved from memory module or PIN may be accessed or retrieved from flash memory . The password may be obtained from the user interface. The token may be obtained from the third party authentication server as described in greater detail below with respect to SSO. Referring to at process the authentication server sends via the appropriate pluggable external authentication module the credential information and appropriate login information to the identified third party authentication server . At process the authentication server receives a message indicating successful authentication or failure otherwise .

Reference is now made to which shows an example user interface of a login page in accordance with an example embodiment. This may for example be displayed on a display of the client device and rendered by an appropriate application rendered by either the client device or the client server depending on whether the system is a thick client system or thin client system . As shown the login page includes fields for user identity . . . n and fields for the user credentials . . . n . There is also a field for a user domain which is optional and may be automatically populated in some embodiments . The login page further includes a drop down selection menu which includes an option for selection of particular third party authentication servers by name as well as their supported credential type s .

Reference is now made to which shows a flow diagram of a detail communication system between a client system and a service the service including an authentication server . Similar reference numbers are used for convenience. The authentication server includes pluggable external authentication modules denoted as Authenticator Plug in and Plug in . Each Plug in may correspond to a specific third party authentication server for example Plug in may correspond to Active Directory and Plug in may correspond to Domino . The authentication server also includes the modules of plug in manager module Authentication Server login module and user manager module . The client system includes the modules of login page module and security login session command module . Generally as shown in processes to relate to rendering of a login page via the login page module while processes to relate to processes upon login. In example embodiments the various modules are configured to send receive and or process a credential type object which facilitates third party authentication of the client system .

At the login page requests all available third party authenticators from the plug in manager module . The plug in manager then requests each specific plug in two in this example to provide their supported credential types wherein there may be one or more credential types supported by each plug in . Accordingly at the plug in manager module then requests plug in for its credential types and at in response plug in sends the supported credential types. Similarly at the plug in manager module requests plug in for its credential types and at in response plug in sends the supported credential types to the plug in manager module . As illustrated by supported credential types plug in may support password SSO SIM and or PIN.

Reference is now briefly made to which shows a data transfer object of an authenticator supported credential types in accordance with an example embodiment. The data transfer object may be what is sent at process and wherein the data transfer object includes a credential type which is the supported credential type identifiers for each authenticator plug in . The authenticator supported credential types also includes the plug in ID which is the identifier of the authenticator plug in e.g. or associated with its particular third party authentication server the Type which is the type of service unique to the plug in and IsDataLoaded parameter which is whether or not data is loaded.

Referring again to at process the plug in manager returns to the login page module the identification of the plug ins as well as their respective supported credential types. At the login page module creates third party authenticator types options for a login page drop down. This may for example be displayed on a user interface in the form of a list or menu of selectable credential types for each third party authenticator. shows an example of such a login page .

Referring still to reference is now made to processes to which relate to processes upon login. At the login page module receives a command selecting one of the supported authenticator plug ins plug in in this example as well as the selected credential type and other information such as domain and username. The particular credential information that is sent depends on the credential type. If the selected credential type is of type password the login page module may also receive user password information e.g. alphanumeric from the user interface. If the credential type is of type token the token has been obtained from the third party authenticator . In other selected credential types e.g. SIM or PIN the relevant credential information may be retrieved or accessed from the appropriate memory.

At the login page module sends relevant login information along with the selected parameter credential type . At the Security Login Session Command module encodes the user name and the credential information together referred to herein as a compound user name together with the selected credential type. At the Security Login Session Command module creates a client login context with the encoded compound username and encoded password along with additional information as necessary. At the Security Login Session Command module sends the client login context to the login module .

Reference is now briefly made to which shows a data object of the client login context in accordance with an example embodiment. The data object may for example be generated at process and sent at process . As shown the data object includes encoded parameters for User Name Credential Information Domain which is the domain string of the client Authenticator Type e.g. plug in Authenticator Plug In identifier and Credential type which is the selected credential type.

Referring again to continuing with the example at the login module invokes login with additional parameter credential type to the user manager module . At the user manager module delegates the username password domain and the selected credential type to the identified plug in plug in in this example .

At plug in selects an appropriate authentication mechanism of the third party authentication server based upon the passed selected credential type. At plug in decodes compound user name and the credential information. At plug in authenticates the user using the selected authentication mechanism from the third party authentication server .

Referring still to the system and flow diagram shown in an example embodiment implementing Single Sign On SSO will now be described in greater detail. In example embodiments an SSO option may be selected using the login page . In other example embodiments for SSO the list or menu of credential types not required and the flow diagram starts at process . In other example embodiments SSO as credential type may be pre selected as a selectable option in a configuration menu or using a selectable option upon installation at the client.

In the following example embodiments without intending to be limiting the third party authentication server is Active Directory and the credential type is SSO and plug in is the associated plug in for Active Directory. The example authentication mechanism for SSO credential type in these embodiments is Kerberos which is understood in the art to be a secure authentication protocol in which a trusted third party is relied upon to perform authentication of clients through exchange of encrypted tickets or tokens. For example Kerberos is the native authentication protocol for Windows Active Directory domains. Generally SSO enables the service to authenticate clients which have obtained a Kerberos Ticket from the Active Directory domain server. This means client devices may not have to provide their Active Directory username password and domain information explicitly to the authentication server . The client system can use the local Kerberos credential cache to obtain their Ticket Granting Ticket TGT and do Kerberos Exchange TGS Exchange with the Domain Controller KDC to obtain the service ticket and provide the obtained ticket to the authentication server . The authentication server can validate this ticket using a Kerberos Key exchanged from the Domain Controller . Note that the authentication server becomes Kerberos enabled service in order to obtain this Kerberos Key.

In example embodiments some web based clients browsers such as Internet Explorer Firefox and Safari can be configured to automatically obtain a service ticket using HTTP Negotiate if the Web server hosting the URL supports Single Sign on using Kerberos. This support is provided by these browsers using a mechanism referred to as Integrated Windows Authentication IWA . In other example embodiments using thick client systems the client obtains this service ticket explicitly using a Ticket Granting Ticket TGT stored in a local Kerberos credential cache. It can be appreciated that authenticating the web client users using Single Sign on may allow a client user to merely open its IWA configured browser to by pass the login screen.

Referring still to SSO login flow is performed as follows. The client system initiates a SPNEGO login by obtaining a SPNEGO token from the Active Directory authentication server . At process the login page module of the client system initiates login with the Base64 encoded SPNEGO token string the credential type the external authenticator identifier Active Directory plug in Id in this example the username domain and external authentication type. At process the security login session command module encodes the new credential type parameter as well with the compound user name user name and password credential information and creates a client login context. At the client system sends the login context including the credential type parameter to the login module . The login flow from this point until authenticator plug in e.g. Active Directory plug in is performed in a similar manner as described above. At the AS Login Module gets the compound username and the password. At the AS Login Module delegates the username password domain and credential type to the identified plug in which is the Active Directory plug in via User Manager module . At the Active Directory plug in checks the credential type parameter and determines if the client user needs SPNEGO based authentication. At if the credential type is SPNEGO the Active Directory plug in decodes the password which is a Base64 encoded SPNEGO token and gets the client SPNEGO token. At the Active Directory plug in creates a server side GSS context using the user s credentials. The Active Directory authentication server accepts the GSS security context using the client SPNEGO token. If the context is established client is authenticated successfully.

Still referring to after successful authentication additional steps or processes may be performed. Generally the AD plug in performs the remainder of the authentication process eventually resulting in an AS user Id in relation to the authentication server . On successful authentication AD plug in returns an AS User ID to the User Manager module which creates a User Login Attributes object using the returned AS User ID. The User Manager module returns the User Login Attributes object to the AS Login Module . The AS Login Module then initializes the security session with the returned User Login Attributes. The AS Login Module sets a Principal data object with the username as well as the credential in the security session. The AS Login Module sets the compound user name encoded user name with password and the User Login Attributes. The AS Login Module returns to the security login session command module the Principal data object and the security session. The security login session command module then returns the session to the client user e.g. client device .

Reference is now made to which shows a block diagram illustrating a third party authentication of a client systems using single sign on SSO login in accordance with example embodiments. Similar reference numbers are used for convenience. In the described example embodiments without intending to be limiting the third party authentication server is Active Directory and the credential type is SSO and the plug in is the associated plug in for Active Directory.

The SSO valve may for example be implemented to get the credentials set from the browser which initiated the SSO URL request. The login SSO page handler processes the SSO URL request. This page translates credentials set by the SSO Valve the login process to start. On page load the SSO page handler uses HTTP parameters set by the SSO Valve to create SSO credentials. These credentials are used to initiate SSO login from the page.

Specific steps of the thin client system will now be described in greater detail still referring to . At the browser includes an HTTP Client which attempts to access a desired or specified authentication server domain or URL to request an SSO page for the purpose to bypass explicitly providing user credentials for login to Service . If already authenticated by the authentication server the browser will be redirected to the service home page. If not already authenticated the SSO Valve intercepts the HTTP request and initiates HTTP Negotiate to get the credentials from the HTTP client wherein the credentials are in the form a SPNEGO token At the HTTP Client sends the SPNEGO token containing forwardable TGT TGS to the SSO Valve by initiating a GSS security context. The SSO Valve accepts the SPNEGO token and creates a Subject including username domain and client GSS credentials. At the Login SSO page handler accesses the username domain and the delegated client GSS credentials provided by the SSO Valve . The Login SSO page handler initiates GSS security context and gets an SPNEGO client token. Login SSO page handler encodes the SPNEGO client token into a Base64 encoded string. At the Login SSO page handler provides the username domain encoded SPNEGO client token as password or credential information authenticator Id in this example Active Directory plug in identifier and the external authenticator type and the additional parameter credential type to the Security Login session command module .

At the Security Login session command module forwards the login information along with the additional credential type parameter to the Security Manager Utilities module . At the Security Manager Utilities module encodes a compound user name user name and password with the additional credential type parameter and provides same to AS Login Module . At the AS Login Module invokes login with additional parameter for credential type. At the User Manager delegates to the Active Directory plug in with additional credential type parameter. At the Active Directory plug in checks the credential type parameter. If it is type SSO the Active Directory plug in treats password or credential information as a SPNEGO token and decodes the token for authentication using the active directory domain controller .

As can be appreciated referring again to for the thin client system the credential type may be implicitly chosen by a web application of the web server when there is no initial manual login attempt by the user for Single Sign on SSO . The web application of the web server may implicitly reads the credentials of the user from the HTTP request and delegates those credentials for authentication with credential type as SSO . Accordingly much of the functionality in this embodiment may be performed by the web server including the sending of the selected credential type.

Upon installation or using a configuration menu an interface may be provided on the fat client which includes an option to select SSO as the credential type. For example check box based options may be added which provides the option to enable Active Directory Third party authentication server SSO credential type authentication. If Active Directory SSO authentication is enabled the fat client may automatically implement SSO which includes sending to the authentication server the identification of SSO credential type in the credential type parameter.

Still referring to the process implemented by the fat client system will now be described in greater detail. At the thick client application obtains a SPNEGO token from the client user s Kerberos credentials from the Active Directory authentication server . At the thick client application initiates login with the Security Manager Utilities Module using the client user name and the valid SPNEGO token as password or credential information. For example the token can be base64 encoded and placed into the password string. An additional parameter for credential type is also passed which indicates SSO as the credential type. At the Security Manager Utilities Module encodes a compound user name with the additional credential type parameter and sends the same together with the password string to the AS Login Module . At the AS Login Module invokes login with additional parameter for credential type. At the User Manager delegates to the Active Directory plug in with additional credential type parameter. At the Active Directory plug in checks the credential type parameter. If it is type SSO the Active Directory plug in treats password or credential information as a SPNEGO token and decodes the token for authentication using the active directory domain controller .

As can be appreciated in some example embodiments only the client system and the external authenticator plug in module or may need to be modified or configured to effect operation of the above describe embodiments. Thus in example embodiments the third party authentication servers operate as normal and are unaware of any such modifications. For thin client systems the client device or client user may also be unaware of any such modifications as much of the functionality is performed by the client server .

It may be appreciated that the use of the credential type parameter may assist the plug in in choosing the appropriate authentication mechanism based upon the selected credential type. For example should the third party authentication server support more than one authentication protocol and therefore more than one credential type the associated authenticator plug in would direct the credential information appropriately to the third party authentication server for using the correct authentication protocol.
