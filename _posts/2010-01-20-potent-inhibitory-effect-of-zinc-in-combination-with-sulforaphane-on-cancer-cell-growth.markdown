This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 146 342 filed Jan. 22 2009 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

This invention was made with government support under Grant Number CA 116815 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention

The invention generally relates to cancer treatment. In particular the present invention relates to methods for preventing or treating tumor growth including prostate cancer using a composition comprising a combination of zinc and sulforaphane SFN .

Prostate cancer is the sixth mostly frequently diagnosed cancer in the world the most common cancer and the second leading cause of death due to cancer in men in the United States 1 2 . In addition prostate cancer accounts for 29 218 890 of new cases in man and becomes the biggest killer of men over 85 years in the United States 3 4 . Conventional therapies against prostate cancer include radiation therapy and radical prostatectomy while more than one third of these cases will develop metastases which are further targeted by androgen ablation therapy 5 . However some of the metastases turn androgen independent which renders androgen ablation therapy less effective. Therefore more research on advanced therapies is needed to obtain better anti cancer treatments for therapeutic clinical purposes.

Zinc as a form of daily diet is an essential element for functionality of about 300 enzymes DNA stabilization and gene expression 6 . Besides it has been estimated that up to ten percent of all mammalian proteins bind zinc for their structure maintenance and normal activities 7 . A recent study has proposed that Zinc can serve as a signaling molecule which transfers signals in two distinct stages 1 in early signaling released zinc from endoplasmic reticulum ER as a second messenger transfers extracellular stimulus inside cells in a calcium and mitogen activated protein kinase MAPK dependent manner 2 in late signaling zinc may induce different expression profile 8 . The so called late zinc signaling has been confirmed in our recent studies.

It has been well established that normal human prostate gland contains the highest zinc level among the whole body. When prostate cells become malignant there is a dramatic decrease of cellular zinc 60 70 loss 9 . Although the specific mechanism of such decreased zinc level in prostate cancer cells is not fully understood our previous findings indicated that decreased expression of zinc binding protein metallothioneins MTs in prostate cancer may contribute to such loss of zinc levels 10 . Furthermore we also observed that high zinc levels could be restored in the androgen independent malignant prostate cell line PC 3 after zinc supplementation in vitro. It is observed that zinc exposure also induces apoptosis in PC 3 cells via mitochondria dependent pathway in contrast zinc induced cell apoptosis was not observed in normal prostate cell line HPR 1 cells 11 13 .

Besides trace elements like zinc many diet foods have also been largely studied for their potential effect against cancer in recent years. Epidemiologic studies continues to support that dietary intake of cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and cabbage can reduce cancer risk at sites including prostate 14 16 . Accordingly compounds hided inside these vegetables become of interest. Among those responsible for such anticancinogenic effect of these vegetables organic isothiocyanates ITCs have been considered to play a major role. SFN 1 Isothiocyanato 4 methylsulfinylbutane as a member of ITCs family is found highly in broccoli and broccoli sprouts 17 . Generation of SFN is conducted via hydrolysis of glucosinolates by myrosinase released when these vegetables are chewed. Since its isolation growing studies has been focused on it due to its anticarcinogenic action as a nature product from diet. Multiple mechanisms such as inhibition of phase 1 and 2 enzymes are thought to explain its effect on cancers 18 . Due to these anticarcinogenic actions of SFN it has been used to combine with other traditional chemotherapeutic agents to generate synergistic tumor inhibitory effect. Tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand TRAIL for example was used together with SFN to boost its effect against lung and liver cancers 19 20 . Therefore SFN might be a good candidate in terms of combinational application with other anticarcinogenic regents. However whether SFN can sensitize prostate cancer cells to zinc effect has previously not been studied or evaluated. Thus there is a need to identify and validate combinations of SFN and other therapies which can have therapeutic applications for treating various cancers.

This invention is directed to pharmaceutical compositions comprising zinc and sulforaphane and to methods for treating or preventing cancer using those compositions. The modulation of MAPK pathway proteins and metallothionein is implicated in the inhibitory effect observed with these compositions.

Specific examples of cancers that can be treated by this method include but are not limited to cancer of the head neck eye mouth throat esophagus chest bone lung colon stomach breast ovaries kidney liver brain bladder uterus pancreas and prostate.

In one embodiment of the invention the invention encompasses a method of treating prostate cancer in a patient comprising administering SFN and zinc wherein the amount of SFN administered to the patient can range from milligram to gram levels and the amount of zinc administered can range from about 15 to 100 mg day. Oral administration is a typical route of administration.

In another embodiment the invention encompasses a method of treating cancer in a patient comprising administering SFN and zinc wherein the combination treatment yields a synergistic growth inhibitory effect on the patient cancer cells.

In another embodiment the invention encompasses a method of treating cancer in a patient comprising administering SFN and zinc wherein the combination treatment increases apoptosis in the cancer cells.

In another embodiment the invention encompasses a method of increasing the therapeutic efficacy of SFN for treating cancer comprising administering to a patient in need thereof an amount of zinc that is sufficient to increase the therapeutic efficacy of the SFN.

In another embodiment the invention encompasses a kit for used in the treatment or prevention of cancer which comprises a therapeutically effective amount of SFN and a therapeutically effective amount of zinc.

As used herein the term cancer includes but is not limited to solid tumors and blood born tumors. The term cancer refers to disease of skin tissues organs bone cartilage blood and vessels. The invention encompasses the treatment of various types of cancer including but not limited to cancer of the head neck eye mouth throat esophagus chest bone lung colon rectum stomach breast ovaries kidney liver brain prostate and pancreas. The term cancer further encompasses primary and metastatic cancers unless otherwise indicated.

As used herein to describe a compound or chemical moiety the term derivative means a compounds or chemical moiety wherein the degree of saturation of at least one bond has been changed e.g. a single bond has been changed to a double or triple bound or wherein at least one hydrogen atom is replaced with a different chemical moiety. Examples of different atoms and chemical moieties include but are not limited to halogen oxygen nitrogen sulfur hydroxy methoxy alkyl amine amide ketone and aldehyde.

As used herein the term prodrug means a derivative of a compound that can hydrolyze oxidize or otherwise react under biological conditions in vitro or in vivo to provide the compound.

Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death in multicellular organisms. It is one of the main types of programmed cell death which involves a series of biochemical events leading to a characteristic cell morphology and death including blebbing changes to the cell membrane such as loss of membrane asymmetry and attachment cell shrinkage nuclear fragmentation chromatin condensation and chromosomal DNA fragmentation. Processes of disposal of cellular debris whose results do not damage the organisms differentiate apoptosis from necrosis.

Synergistic effect is a biological response to exposure to multiple chemicals agents which is greater than the sum of the effects of the individual agents. It is an effect that occurs when two or more agents for example medications have a more powerful effect when used together than either has been used alone. Many chemotherapeutic agents have synergistic effects and chemotherapy regimens often include treatment with more than one drug.

This invention is based in part on the finding that SFN can effectively enhance the apoptotic effect of zinc on prostate cancer cells in a synergistic fashion. Embodiments of the invention include a method of treating or preventing cancer which comprises the administration of SFN or a derivative or analog thereof in combination with zinc to a patient. The synergistic effect of these two compounds on tumor cells results in high efficiency and decreased toxicity by reducing the treating dosage for each compound. Possible mechanisms for such combinatorial effect are thought to include 1 attenuation of zinc effect on MT1 2 proteins by SFN 2 synergistic effect of zinc and SFN on ROS generation 3 synergistic activation of P38 by zinc and SFN. Clearly there may be other possible operative mechanisms which explain the observed effect. These data help to explore the possibility of reducing dosage of each reagent while maintaining a major inhibitory effect on prostate cancer cells and to provide a better methodology for cancer treatment. In short the invention encompasses the therapeutic effects that result from the unexpected and unique synergy between SFN and zinc on cancer cells.

Two human prostatic cell lines were used a HPR 1 a cell line derived from normal human prostate epithelial cells kindly provided by Dr. C. K. Choo University of Hong Kong Hong Kong China and b PC 3 a human malignant prostate cell line ATCC Rockville Md. . HPR 1 cells were cultured in keratinocyte medium supplemented with epidermal growth factor EGF 2.5 mg 500 ml and bovine pituitary extracts 25 mg 500 ml Gibco BRL Life Technologies Bethesda Md. . PC 3 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 5 or 10 of fetal bovine serum FBS respectively. All media were supplemented with penicillin streptomycin 1 U ml Invitrogen and the cells were maintained at 37 C. in a humidified incubator with 5 CO. The passages of the cell lines were within the range of 5 40. Once the cell density reached 50 60 confluence the growth media were replaced by fresh serum supplement free medium for 24 h to synchronize cell growth. The cells were then treated with or without zinc sulfate concentrations as indicated in the legends in fresh serum supplement free medium for 0 1 3 6 12 and 24 h respectively.

Cell viability and proliferation were evaluated with the MTT assay. The cells were seeded at a density of 9 10cells well in a 96 well plate containing 100 l culture medium well. After attachment cells were treated with or without zinc and or SFN at various concentrations in serum supplement free medium. After 24 h treatment 10 l MTT 5 mg ml sigma was added into each well and incubated at 37 C. for 1 h. Then the medium was removed and 100 l dimethyl sulfoxide DMSO was added to dissolve water insoluble formazan crystals converted from water soluble MTT by living cells. The color absorbency of formazan was detected at a wavelength of 540 nm using a microplate reader Molecular Devices .

Total cellular proteins from the experimental samples were extracted by radioimmuno precipitation assay RIPA lysis buffer Upstate Lake Placid N.Y. containing protease inhibitor Roche Diagnostics Gmbh Mannheim Germany . The protein extracts 30 g lane were applied to electrophoresis on an SDS polyacrylamide gel and then a transferred poly vinylidene fluoride PVDF membrane Millipore Billerica Mass. was blocked in 5 nonfat dry milk in phosphate buffered saline PBS containing 0.05 Tween 20 Sigma St. Louis Mo. PBST for 1 hr at room temperature followed by the hybridization to the primary antibodies against PARP BD pharmingen San Jose Calif. caspase 3 BD pharmingen San Jose Calif. p JNK and JNK1 Santa Cruz Calif. pP38 and P38 Cell Signaling Technology Danvers Mass. ppERK1 2 Sigma St. Louis Mo. ERK1 2 Cell Signaling Technology Danvers Mass. at 4 C. overnight. After washing the membranes were incubated with corresponding second antibodies. Beta actin Sigma St. Louis Mo. and GAPDH Cell Signaling Technology Danvers Mass. were used as internal controls to monitor the sample loadings. The specific binding signals were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence ECL Pierce Rockford Ill. according to the manufacturer s instructions. The signals of targeted bands were scanned and quantified with an LKB Ultra Scan XL laser densitometer Image Quant Molecular Dynamics Sunnyvale Calif. .

For cytochrome C detection cells were fractionated as previously reported 1 . Briefly cells were collected and washed once with PBS. Then cells were homogenized on ice with a Dounce homogenizer 80 strokes in extraction buffer containing 250 mM sucrose 20 mM HEPES PH 7.2 1.5 mM MgCl 1 mM EDTA 10 mM KCl 1 mM EGTA and protease inhibitors tablet 1 tablet 10 ml . The homogenates were centrifuged twice at 750 g for 5 min at 4 C. to remove nuclei and debris. The supernatants were further centrifuged at 10 000 g for 30 min. The supernatants were removed and stored at 80 C. until analysis by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The primary antibody for cytochrome C was purchased from BD Biosciences Pharmingen San Jose Calif. .

Cell flow cytometric analysis with 3 3 dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide DiOC6 3 Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. and propidium iodide PI BD Pharmingen San Jose Calif. was used to evaluate MMP and apoptosis of the cells. The fluorescence dye DiOC6 3 is featured by its accumulation in the mitochondrial matrix which is resulted from negative mitochondrial membrane potential within viable cells. Thus the changes of fluorescence of DiOC6 3 reflect the MMP alteration of the cells. Another fluorescence dye PI is cell membrane impermeable and able to stain DNA once cell membrane integrity is damaged during apoptosis. In the experiments after treatments cells 2.5 10 ml were incubated with 100 nM DiOC6 3 in PBS for 15 min at 37 C. Then the cells were washed in PBS once followed by incubation with 2.5 g ml PI for additional 10 min at room temperature. The samples were subjected to cell flow cytometric analysis and FACScan Becton Dickinson was used to analyze the fluorescence of DIOC6 3 and PI 2 .

5 and 6 carboxy 2 7 dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate carboxy HDCFDA was used to determine the intracellular ROS levels of individual cells. In living cells this compound is oxidized and converted to the 2 7 dichlorofluoroscein DCF that is highly fluorescent. In the experiments PC 3 cells cultured on 12 well plates were incubated in serum free medium containing zinc sulfate 12.5 mM SFN 12 M . Thirty min prior to the completion of the time course carboxy H2DCFDA was added at a final concentration of 5 M. Cells were then collected and washed once with PBS. The fluorescent intensity of DCF was assayed by FACScan Becton Dickinson 3 .

Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling TUNEL assay was carried out using an in situ cell death detection kit Roche Indianapolis Ind. . PC 3 cells were grown on the cover slips placed in a 12 well plate. After attachment cells were treated with serum free medium containing zinc 12.5 M and or SFN 12 M . After 24 h treatment the cells were fixed with 4 paraformaldehyde USB Cleveland Ohio for 1 h at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.1 sodium citrate containing 0.1 Triton X 100 Sigma St. Louis Mo. on ice for 2 min. Cells were then incubated with 50 l of TUNEL reaction mixture in the dark in a humidified chamber at 37 C. for 1 h. After cells were washed three times with PBS cells were then incubated with Hoechst 33258 0.1 g ml Molecular Probes Eugene Oreg. for 10 min at 37 C. and then washed three times with PBS. Finally the cells were mounted to the slides with aqueous antifade medium Polyscience Warrington Pa. The apoptotic cells were determined and photographed using a fluorescence microscope Nikon Eclipse E800 .

Differential Cell Viability of Normal and Malignant Human Prostate Cells in Responses to Zinc and SFN Treatment

To ascertain whether the growth effect of zinc and SFN exhibits with the cell type specific property the dose response experiments with zinc and SFN were independently carried out in normal prostate epithelium cell line HPR 1 and prostate malignant cell line PC 3 cells . The cells were incubated with zinc or SFN for 24 h at a concentration range of 0 30 M zinc and 0 40 M SFN respectively.

The results showed that in PC 3 cells the 50 inhibitory concentration IC values were 16.2 0.9 M in response to zinc treatment and 20.3 0.8 M for SFN . In contrast HPR 1 cells were much insensitive to both treatments especially to zinc. As shown in at higher zinc concentration 30 M less than 20 of PC 3 cells could survive while around 90 of HPR 1 cells were still able to stay alive which are congruent with our previously observations 1 2 . As to SFN treatment HPR 1 cells appeared to be no response to lower concentration of SFN 25 M at that condition and reached its plateau at the concentration of 25 M and even higher. 60 of HPR 1 cells were still alive while PC 3 cell growth was continuously to be inhibited.

Dose response study of zinc SFN combinations and a computerized program analysis to identify the synergistic effect of the combinations in corresponding to their growth inhibitory effect in PC 3 cells

Based on the inhibitory effect of zinc and SFN on malignant PC 3 cell growth revealed in a dose response study of zinc and SFN with selected dose combinations was carried out to identify if the combinations with selective dosages would play a synergistic effect which leads to enhanced anti growth role with reduced dosage to limit the possible toxic effect of the agents.

Table 1 showed that total 21 combinations of zinc and SFN were chosen based on the maximum power design the elected concentrations range in zinc 0.42 M to 22.92 M and in SFN 0.66 M to 30.50 M . The growth inhibitory effect of these combinations was examined in PC 3 cells and the cell viability was measured by MTT assay. Within total 147 analytic experiments the cell viabilities in response to corresponding combination of zinc and SFN were extended from 71.3 to 31.0 listed in Table 1.

To further characterize the synergistic effect displayed by the combinations of zinc and SFN a computerized analysis with special analytic program was engaged. showed the response surface of the combinations of zinc and SFN and the corresponding contour plot is given in . With the 147 observations from the combination experiments the F test proposed by Fang et al. 2003 indicates the definitive area limited to additive effect of zinc and SFN F 166.4705 p value 

To select proper combinations of zinc and SFN and were overlaid to generate from which six combinations with individual corresponding interaction index less than 1 were selected zinc SFN i.e. 8 M 20 M 10 M 10 M 10 M 15 M 10 M 20 M 15 M 5 M and 12.5 M 12 M. The zinc and SFN combinations with these compositions were used as the candidates in further synergistic effect studies.

Synergistic growth inhibitory effect was further characterized in HPR 1 and PC 3 cells . For each of 6 selected dose combinations the cells were treated without or with zinc SFN respectively for 24 h and then the cell viability was assessed using MTT staining. showed that in HPR 1 cells there were no more than 10 to 20 cell reductions observed with the combinations and the cells basically have no response to zinc which was the same to the earlier observation. In contrast a significant synergistic growth inhibitory effect was observed in PC 3 cells . There was more than 70 reduction of cell population when the combination of zinc 12.5 M and SFN 12 M or with the combination of 10 M 15 M was applied in comparison with the 20 30 reduction observed with their individual treatment. The results are consistent with what were predicted in . Among the 6 combinations the combination of 12.5 M zinc and 12 M SFN has an interaction index less than 0.8 and exhibits maximum synergistic inhibitory effect with considerable reduction of their individual doses about 20 reduction of zinc and 40 of SFN to minimize their possible toxic effect we well. This combination elected in the following experiments to study the underlying mechanism s .

Zinc at a higher concentration induced prostate cell apoptosis has been reported previously by our group and others. In this study we further investigated whether the combination of zinc 12.5 M and SFN 12 M would induce apoptosis in PC 3 cells. Key component proteins involved in zinc induced apoptosis were examined by Western blot . Results showed that only the combination of zinc and SFN significantly induced mitochondrial cytochrome c release which further triggered downstream pro caspase 3 and PARP Poly ADP ribose polymerase activation evident with the protein cleavage by decreasing levels of the pro forms . The synergistic apoptotic effect was aberrant in comparison to lack of cell responses to either zinc or SFN respectively.

To further confirm the zinc SFN combination induced apoptotic characteristics in PC 3 cells the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling TUNEL assay was performed and the results are shown in . PC 3 cells with different treatments were subjected to Hoechst 33258 and TUNEL staining for individual determination of apoptosis index. With Hoechst staining blue nuclear condensation and lower cell density were observed in PC 3 cells treated with zinc SFN combination compared with other treatments. Correspondingly many cells with positive TUNEL staining green were appeared concordantly only in cells with condensed nuclei indicating more cells has undergone apoptosis after combined treatment with zinc and SFN.

Synergistic Effect of Zinc SFN Combination on Stimulating ROS Production in PC 3 Cells which can be Inhibited by ROS Inhibitors of NAC and GSH

Previous studies indicated ROS production involved in both zinc and SFN induced cell apoptosis 3 4 herein we examined the effect of zinc SFN combination on ROS production in both PC 3 and HPR 1 cells . The results shown in demonstrated that in PC 3 cells a dramatic increase of ROS production about 3 fold increase than that in control was only observed in the cells treated with zinc SFN combination after 12 to 24 h. SFN alone increased ROS levels about 35 and 55 and zinc treatment appeared to have less than 40 50 increase of ROS level at the late time points 12 to 24 h . However in HPR 1 cells a similar steady induction of ROS levels by about 1.5 to 1.8 increase was observed in the cells treated with either SFN or zinc SFN combination. Neither much higher ROS production nor synergistic induction effect by zinc SFN combination was observed. The ROS production in PC 3 cells was further determined by flow cytometry analysis with the cells stained with both PI and DCFDA . Results showed that increased cell population exhibiting enhanced fluoresces staining with DCFDA staining monitoring the ROS production and with lower staining of PI indicating a living cell was only observed in the cells treated with zinc SFN combination as shown in lower right area of the corresponding panel in B. The result indicated that increased ROS production came from living PC 3 cells treated with the combination but not from the dead cells.

The synergistic effect of zinc SFN on ROS production in PC 3 cells was further studies using ROS inhibitors of 6 mM N Acetyl Cysteine NAC or reduced glutathionein GSH . Results showed that both NAC 6 mM and GSH 6 mM significantly inhibited ROS production by zinc SFN or zinc SFN combination at different time points The surge of ROS induced by zinc SFN combination was completely abolished at 24 h of treatment . The growth inhibitory effect of zinc SFN and their combination on PC 3 cell growth was concordantly abolished by NAC and GSH as measured by MTT assay .

Synergistic Effect of Zinc SFN Combination on Losing Mitochondrial Membrane Potential MMP Detected in PC 3 Cells

It has been long recognized that MMP alteration is one of the major causes of apoptosis. To determine the role of zinc SFN combination on MMP DIOC6 3 and PI was employed to measure MMP by flow cytometry analysis. As shown in zinc SFN combination exhibited a strong potency on MMP alteration with a time dependent pattern and the maximum of about 50 of cell population with loss of MMP in comparing to the control about 10 loss was reached at 24 h. Interestingly zinc alone can increase one fold of cell population with loss of MMP than that in the control and SFN alone at least at the concentration of 12 M did not affect MMP at all. The synergistic effect of zinc SFN on MMP alteration was completely prevented by pretreatment with NAC and GSH in all groups with different treatment for 24 .

Zinc SFN Combination Significantly Attenuates MT1 2 Protein Levels in PC 3 Cells but not in HPR 1 Cells

MT1 2 proteins are known to be induced by zinc treatment Hua2008 and MTs are important to cellular zinc homeostasis and function as ROS scavenger to further understand the relationship between MT expressions and zinc in the presence of SFN we examined MT1 2 levels in PC 3 and HPR 1 cells with the same treatments as described above . In PC 3 cells a significant induction of MT1 2 was triggered by zinc alone at 24 h which was as the same as we reported earlier Hua 2008 however SFN alone has no effect or a slight inhibition on MT expression at 6 and 24 h respectively. Surprisingly a significant attenuation of MT1 2 levels was observed in the cells treated with zinc SFN combination in both 6 and 24 h of the treatment. The potency of the suppression in MT1 2 expression by zinc SFN combination was obviously observed in comparison to the dramatic induction of MT1 2 induced by zinc alone after 24 h treatment. Our result indicated that SFN may play a suppression role to MT1 2 protein levels in PC 3 cells at present condition.

The effect of SFN on MT1 2 was further examined in HPR 1 cells that have been identified to contain much higher endogenous MT1 2 levels than PC 3 cells Hua2008 . As showed in zinc alone was also able to induce expression of MT1 2 significantly at 24 h treatment while SFN decreased expression of MT1 2 comparing to the control at both 6 h and 24 h after treatment. However the potency of zinc SFN combination on suppression MT1 2 protein level was less than that in PC 3 cells.

MAPK pathway is known to be involved in the machinery mechanism of cell death to determine whether zinc SFN combination is able to affect MAPKs we examined the activation status of three major targets in MAPK subfamilies i.e. p38 ERK and JNK in PC 3 cells. shows that at 6 h treatment zinc and SFN respectively increased phosphorylation of p38 comparing to the control while zinc SFN combination synergistically promoted phosphorylation of p38 as well as the activation of ERK. After 24 h treatment phosphorylated p38 levels in all treatments returned to the control level while phosphorylation of ERK in cells treated with the combination remained at higher level compared to the control. In contrast no alteration of JNK phosphorylation was detected. To identify the earlier activation of p38 a time course study 0.5 1 3 and 6 h was performed in PC 3 cells treated with zinc SFN combination only . Our results showed that the activation of p38 could be detected as early as at 1 h treatment and continuously increased up to 6 h indicating the fast activation effect of zinc SFN combination on p38.
