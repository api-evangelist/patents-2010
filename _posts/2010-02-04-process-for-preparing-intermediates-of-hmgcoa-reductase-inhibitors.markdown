The process of PCT publication No. WO 03 087112 may not be desirable on an industrial scale. For example it requires the use of an expensive microorganism such as CLS BC 14011 during the partial hydrolysis of 3 hydroxy diethyl glutarate. Additionally the process uses a hazardous reaction such as isobutylene gas during esterification of ethyl 3S 3 hydroxyglutaric acid in the presence of sulphuric acid and the purification of TSPH by column chromatography is commercially difficult.

US publication No. 2005 0070605A1 discloses the enantioselective opening of 3 hydroxyprotected glutaric anhydride by phenyl ethylamine to faun an amide bond and further converting it to HMG CoA reductase inhibitor.

PCT publication No. WO 2006 021326 discloses the opening of 3 hydroxy protected glutaric anhydride by methanol to yield racemic methyl 3 3 t butyl dimethylsilyloxy 6 dimethoxy phosphinyl 5 oxohexante and the preparation of racemic methyl 3R 3 t butyl dimethylsilyloxy 6 dimethoxy phosphinyl 5 oxohexante.

The disclosed process employs explosive and toxic materials such as diazomethane during the preparation of methyl 3R 3 t butyl dimethylsilyloxy 6 dimethoxy phosphinyl 5 oxohexante esterification . Moreover the yield of the above steps is low and thus the process may not suitable for industrial and commercial use.

J. Org. Chem. 1991 56 3744 47 discloses the preparation of 3R 3 t butyl dimethylsilyloxy 6 dimethoxy phosphinyl 5 oxohexante from 3 hydroxy protected glutaric anhydride. The disclosed process which involves using hazardous reactions such as use of NOoxidation followed by a hydrogenation reaction to cleave the amino group of the resolving agent and use of diazomethane. The process also uses an expensive palladium catalyst which could remain as an impurity in the final product.
