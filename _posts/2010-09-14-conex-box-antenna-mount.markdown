title: Conex box antenna mount
abstract: An antenna mount is provided for securing an antenna at a conex enclosure. The mount includes a box bracket having a plurality of flanges, a base plate disposable beneath the box bracket, and a tensioner plate disposable beneath the base plate. The box bracket has a top surface with an orifice to receive the antenna. The base plate is securable to the flanges by a first plurality of fasteners. The tensioner plate is securable to the base plate by a second plurality of fasteners. The box bracket forms a sheet metal plate folded to form a box with fore, aft, lateral and top sides.

The invention described was made in the performance of official duties by one or more employees of the Department of the Navy and thus the invention herein may be manufactured used or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The invention relates generally to mounting structures for a conex enclosure. In particular the invention relates to a mounting device for a radio antenna with a modular conex box.

A conex enclosure is defined as a water tight metal storage container that protects military equipment from the elements. The United States Armed Forces use a standard military radio antenna for electromagnetic communication. There are no known commercial off the shelf COTS mounting devices that achieve secure mounting of a standard military radio antenna in this manner to a standard conex enclosure for communications use.

Conventional antenna mounts yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular various exemplary embodiments provide an antenna mount for securing an antenna at a conex enclosure. The mount includes a box bracket having a plurality of flanges said box bracket having a top surface with an orifice to receive the antenna a base plate disposable beneath said box bracket said base plate being securable to said flanges by a first plurality of fasteners and a tensioner plate disposable beneath said base plate said tensioner plate being securable to said base plate by a second plurality of fasteners. The box bracket forms a sheet metal plate folded to form a box with a fore aft lateral and top sides.

In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized and logical mechanical and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.

The Conex Box Antenna Mount CBAM is a mounting bracket designed to effectively attach standard military radio antennas to a standard conex enclose for communications use. shows an isometric exploded view of CBAM components. A standard antenna mount bracket with one face exposed as a window represents a sheet metal cover folded to produce an enclosure with a top horizontal surface . The sheet metal can be steel or aluminum. Upon installation the exposed window faces a conex enclosure corner. At opposite ends the bracket includes horizontal flanges with flange holes . The top surface includes a center through hole surrounded by four mount holes .

A base plate with peripheral holes and in line holes is disposed below the bracket . A tensioner plate with counterpart holes aligned with the in line holes is disposed below the plate . The plates can be composed of steel. Five sets of fasteners are disposed through the flange holes to the peripheral holes to attach the bracket to the base plate . Each set of fasteners includes a 16 inch hex bolt a lock washer and a flat washer or shim .

Two sets of fasteners are disposed through the in line holes and the counterpart holes from above the base plate . Each set of fasteners includes a 13 2 inch hex bolt and a flat washer . Two corresponding sets of ends below the tensioner plate secure the base and tensioner plates together. Each set of ends includes a flat washer and a 13 nylon lock nut .

A standard military radio antenna mounts to an antenna bracket through the hole in the top surface utilizing the existing four hole bolt pattern of the antenna mounting base secured by fasteners . The antenna mount is fixed at the base to the CBAM using a five hole bolt pattern on its flange .

The CBAM secures itself to one of any lift corners of a conex enclosure. The CBAM operates by using two mount segments as plates attached with bolts that tighten in compression and pinch the material of the conex enclosure lift corner. This process enables easy and universal mounting of the CBAM to any standard conex enclosure. The CBAM can be repeatedly mounted and removed as often as the operator requires.

By this device United States military personnel can universally and conveniently attach present military radio antennas to a standard military conex box for communications use in any desired environment where a conex enclosure is present.

While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein many modifications substitutions changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art. It is therefore to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit of the embodiments.
