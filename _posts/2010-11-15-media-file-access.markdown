title: Media file access
abstract: A server system stores media library associated with a user. The media library includes at least one media file. The server system determines whether the media file is stored on a second computing device that is able to send the media file to the first computing device across a local network connecting the first computing device and the second computing device. If the determination indicates that the media file is stored on a second computing device that is able to send the stored media file to the first computing device across a local network connecting the first computing device and the second computing device, the server system sends causes the second computing device to send the media file to the first computing device across the local network such that the first computing device is able to output the media file to the user.

Consumers of media e.g. music and video increasingly access and play media stored on remote servers. For example in some schemes consumers may store their media files at a server for remote access from a variety of devices and or users may join a subscription service to gain access a media library stored on a remote server. In some instances users may stream or access media held on remote servers such as through a web browser or a program communicating through an application programming interface.

In one aspect a computer implemented method for sending media files to a computing device includes storing at a server system a media library associated with a user the media library including at least one media file and receiving at the server system a request from a first computing device for the media file from the media library. The first computing device sent the request in response to the user selecting the media file for output by the first computing device. The method further includes determining at the server system whether the media file is stored on a second computing device that is able to send the media file to the first computing device across a local network connecting the first computing device and the second computing device. The method includes sending the media file to the first computing device from the server system such that the first computing device is able to output the media file to the user if the determination indicates that the media file is not stored on a second computing device that is able to send the stored media file to the first computing device across a local network connecting the first computing device and the second computing device. The method also includes sending from the server system to the first computing device or the second computing device an instruction that causes the second computing device to send the media file to the first computing device across the local network such that the first computing device is able to output the media file to the user if the determination indicates that the media file is stored on a second computing device that is able to send the stored media file to the first computing device across a local network connecting the first computing device and the second computing device.

Implementations may include one or more of the following features. For example the method may include determining whether the user of the first computing device and a user of the second computing device have both opted into a service that provides for the sending of requested media items between devices on local networks when available rather than sending the requested media items from the server system.

The method may include determining that the second computing device has sent an initial portion of the media file to the first computing device across the local network but is unable to send a remaining portion of the media file to the first computing device across the local network and in response to determining that the second computing device is unable to send the remaining portion of the media file to the first computing device across the local network sending from the server system the remaining portion of the media file to the first computing device.

The second computing device may be unable to send the remaining portion of the media file to the first computing device across the local network because the second computing device is disconnected from the local network. The first computing device may have sent the request for the media item across a cellular network that is not a part of the local network. The local network may be a non cellular wireless local area network.

The local network may be an isolated local network. The first computing device may have sent the request to the server system across the local network and one or more intermediary networks connecting the local network to a network that includes the server system.

Determining at the server system whether the media file is stored on a second computing device that is able to send the media file to the first computing device across a local network connecting the first computing device and the second computing device may include determining that the first computing device and the second computing device are connected to the local network. Determining at the server system whether the media file is stored on a second computing device that is able to send the media file to the first computing device across a local network connecting the first computing device and the second computing device may include determining that the first computing device and the second computing device are located within a defined geographic proximity such that a wireless local area network is able to be established between the first computing device and the second computing device.

In another aspect a system includes a first computing device a second computing device a local network and a server system. The first computing device is configured to send a request to a server system for a media file. The second computing device stores the media file. The local network connects the first computing device and the second computing device. The server system is configured to receive the request from the first computing device determine that the media file is stored on the second computing device determine that the second computing device is able to send the media file to the first computing device across the local network and in response to determining that the media file is stored on the second computing device and that the second computing device is able to send the media file to the first computing device across the local network send to the first computing device or the second computing device an instruction that causes the second computing device to send the media file to the first computing device across the local network such that the first computing device is able to output the media file to the user.

Implementations may include one or more of the following features. For example the media file may be stored at the server system as part of a media library associated with a user of the first computing device. The first computing device may send the request in response to the user selecting the media file for output by the first computing device.

The server system may be further configured to determine whether the user of the first computing device and a user of the second computing device have both opted into a service that provides for the sending of requested media items between devices on local networks when available rather than sending the requested media items from the server system.

The server system may be further configured to determine that the second computing device has sent an initial portion of the media file to the first computing device across the local network but is unable to send a remaining portion of the media file to the first computing device across the local network and in response to determining that the second computing device is unable to send the remaining portion of the media file to the first computing device across the local network send the remaining portion of the media file to the first computing device.

The second computing device may be unable to send the remaining portion of the media file to the first computing device across the local network because the second computing device is disconnected from the local network. The first computing device may have sent the request for the media item across a cellular network that is not a part of the local network.

In another aspect a computer readable medium storing instruction that when executed by one or more processing devices cause the one or more processing devices to store at a server system a media library associated with a user the media library including at least one media file receive at the server system a request from a first computing device for the media file from the media library wherein the first computing device sent the request in response to the user selecting the media file for output by the first computing device determine at the server system whether the media file is stored on a second computing device that is able to send the media file to the first computing device across a local network connecting the first computing device and the second computing device if the determination indicates that the media file is not stored on a second computing device that is able to send the stored media file to the first computing device across a local network connecting the first computing device and the second computing device send the media file to the first computing device from the server system such that the first computing device is able to output the media file to the user and if the determination indicates that the media file is stored on a second computing device that is able to send the stored media file to the first computing device across a local network connecting the first computing device and the second computing device send from the server system to the first computing device or the second computing device an instruction that causes the second computing device to send the media file to the first computing device across the local network such that the first computing device is able to output the media file to the user.

In another aspect a computer implemented method for providing media files to a computing device includes sending from a first computing device to a server system storing a media library associated with a user a request for a media file in the media library such that upon receiving the request the server system determines whether the media file is stored on a second computing device that is able to send the media file to the first computing device across a local network connecting the first computing device and the second computing device if the determination indicates that the media file is not stored on a second computing device that is able to send the stored media file to the first computing device across a local network connecting the first computing device and the second computing device send the media file to the first computing device such that the first computing device is able to output the media file to the user and if the determination indicates that the media file is stored on a second computing device that is able to send the stored media file to the first computing device across a local network connecting the first computing device and the second computing device send to the first computing device or the second computing device an instruction that causes the second computing device to send the media file to the first computing device across the local network such that the first computing device is able to output the media file to the user.

Various implementations of the subject matter described here may provide one or more of the following advantages. In one or more implementations sending media files to a first device from a second device over a local network may result in media file transfers that do not utilize access to the Internet or Internet Service Provider networks. In one or more implementations sending media files to a first device from a second device over a local network may result in media file transfers at higher speed of shorter time and or of higher quality than transfers sent from the media server. In some implementations if a media file is available for streaming from a computing device on a local network it may be less costly to stream the media file from the local network than from the cellular network if the user pays for the data provided by the cellular network on a usage basis. Additionally cellular network bandwidth may be conserved. In one or more implementations sending media files to a first device from a second device over a local network can result in media file transfers when a fault with a media server or peer device prevents the media server or peer device from sending the media file.

The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features objects and advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings and from the claims.

In some implementations a media storage service may be provided in which users upload their media collections or media library to a media server system that is accessible over one or more connected networks such as the Internet. A user may download or stream media files from his media library on the media server system to a user device in the possession of the user such as a mobile device and some or all of the media library may be stored on the user device. User s of the media storage service can opt into or subscribe to a peer to peer music sharing service. As a subscriber a user agrees to allow songs stored locally on his computing device to be streamed to other computing devices and for songs stored on other computing devices to be streamed to his computing device. This occurs when the computing devices are each connected to a local network e.g. a WiFi or Bluetooth network .

Thus in some implementations a user device can request a media file from a remote media server by sending the request across a cellular or other network connection to the media server. The media server can identify that the requesting device e.g. a first computing device and a source device e.g. a second computing device are able to communicate over a local network and are both associated with users that have opted into the media sharing service. The media server can send instructions to the requesting device or the source device that cause the source device to serve the media to the requesting device over the local network. In some implementations the media may be transmitted in encrypted form over the local network between the two devices.

As an example two users in a coffee shop Bob and Sally are connected to a free available WiFi local network. Bob wants to listen to a song he owns or has rights to that is not stored locally on his cell phone. The selected song is stored and available for streaming on Sally s laptop. Both Bob and Sally are connected to the local network and both are subscribers to the peer to peer media sharing service. The server receives the request from Bob s cell phone for the song identifies that Bob and Sally are on the same local network e.g. uses network address or GPS coordinates determines that they are both subscribers to the music sharing service and instructs Sally s device to begin streaming the requested song to Bob s device.

If Sally leaves the coffee shop before the song has finished playing the server can find another source of the song for Bob e.g. use the server copy of the song or identify another subscriber user on the local network to provide seamless streaming of the song to Bob s cell phone.

The user device can include a media player to request and play media files. The media player can generate a request for a media file for example in response to user input requesting that a particular media file or type of media file be output that is played by the device . The request for media file can be sent by the user device through the local network router and Internet to the media server . In response to receiving the request for media file the media server employs the peer matcher to search for a peer to the user device that can send the requested media file to the device across a local network. The peer matcher can identify suitable peers based on one or more factors including but not limited to geographic location network compatibility and storage of a requested media file. In this example the peer matcher may identify the user device as one such peer.

Once the peer matcher has identified a user device as a suitable peer device the media server sends instructions to the user device through the Internet the router and the local network that cause the user device to contact user device across the local network and transmit the requested media file to user device over the local network . Alternatively the media server can send instructions to the user device these instructions not shown that cause the user device to contact the user device and retrieve the requested media file from user device across the local network. In some implementations when no peer is identified the media server sends the media file to the media player .

The user device can retrieve the media file from a media library and send the media file to the user device through the local network . The media player can begin playing the media file. In some implementations the media file can be sent in blocks or an ordered stream and the media player can begin playing the media file as the user device receives the media file . The media server can monitor the transfer of the media file from the user device to the user device . If a termination of the transfer is observed or expected for example because user device disconnects from local network the media server can send the full or remaining untransferred portions of the media file to the user device or locate another device on local network that is storing the media file and cause the other device to send the remaining portion to the user device . In some implementations such as when the media player is streaming media for immediate consumption the media player can play and then discard the media file .

In some implementations only devices that are associated with users that have opted into the media sharing service may be eligible for sharing media across a local network. In this case for example the media server may first determine whether the users of user device and user device have opted into the service before sending the instructions that cause the requested media file to be sent from user device to user device . The media server may make this determination by in response to receiving the request from the media file from user device that the user associated with the user device has opted into the service and then cause the peer matcher to limit the search for peer devices to those that have opted into the service. Alternatively the media server may cause the peer matcher to determine the possible peers and then eliminate those that are not associated with users that have opted into the media sharing service.

The following describes an example of an implementation of system in use. A first user in a coffee shop is using a mobile phone to run a music application that plays music from the user s library stored on a centralized server . The mobile phone is connected to an internet connected Wi Fi network provided by the coffee shop. The user has opted into a media sharing service through the music application to permit streaming of music from local networked sources where available.

The user creates a playlist of songs in the user s library by selecting a genre of music in the music applications interface American Folk for example. The music application generates a request for a playlist of music which is associated with the American Folk genre and sends the request to a centralized server that manages the user s library. The centralized server generates a stream of songs from the user s library that are associated with the American Folk genre and sends the stream to the user s mobile phone. The centralized server also inspects a database table of known devices that are associated with users that have opted into the same media sharing service that are known to have stored a particular music file that is also in the user s library and associated with the American Folk genre and that are on the same local network as the user s mobile phone. Devices on the same local network can be identified for example based on both devices internal and external IP address

In this example one such device is found a laptop used by another user in the coffee shop. Instructions are sent to the laptop with information about the media stream IP address media file identifiers etc. . Personal information about the user of the mobile phone user name device type etc. need not be included for example to protect the privacy of both users. Additionally no notifications need be shown to the user of either device. Alternatively one or both devices can display a message with anonymous data. For example a system alert on the laptop can have the text Providing a media stream to 1 user and an option to cancel the stream. In another example a message in the music application of the mobile phone can show that music is being sent from an unnamed local network source and that audio quality will be improved compared to a stream from the centralized server that must pass through the Internet.

The laptop can create a list of music files identified in the instructions and available in a local music library and can provide a stream of the files to the mobile phone in place of the stream provided by the centralized server. The centralized server may leave the communication channel with the mobile phone active to monitor for the status of the stream from the laptop.

When the stream from the laptop is terminated for example when one device disconnects from the Wi Fi network or when the laptop has exhausted its media files the centralized server can resume providing the media stream .

The following describes another example of an implementation of system in use. A user is using a tablet computing device to access home movies that have been stored on a remote internet connected media server . The original copies of the home movies are also stored on the user s network attached storage NAS device . The tablet is connected to the user s home network by an 802.11 data connection and the NAS is connected to the user s home network by an Ethernet connection.

The user of the tablet device uses a web browser to access the user s personal library listing on the media server and selects a video to watch. The media server determines that the tablet is on the same network as the NAS which contains the original copy of the home movie that the user requested. As such the media server generates a web page with an embedded object to play the movie. The embedded object contains code with instructions to attempt to retrieve the media file from the NAS if possible or from the media server if the NAS is unavailable or unable to provide the media file .

In some implementations of this example serving the home movie from the NAS may provide the tablet with a higher quality version of the media file for example if the media file is compressed by the media server . Additionally this may reduce the usage of the user s internet connection which may have bandwidth caps network latency or usage charges.

The user device can include a media player to request and play media files. The media player can generate a request for a media file for example in response to user input requesting that a particular media file or type of media file be output that is played by the device . The request for media file can be sent by the user device through the ISP network to the media server . In response to receiving the request for media file the media server employs the peer matcher to search for a peer to the user device that can send the requested media file to the device across a local isolated network. In this example the peer matcher may identify the user device as one such peer. For example the user devices and may be geographically close to each other and able to set up and communicate on local network .

An isolated network for example may be a network on which two or more user devices can communicate but which is not connected to the Internet or other networks. Some configurations of a Bluetooth or ad hoc Wi Fi network may be considered isolated networks. The local network may exist at the time the request for media file is sent or it may be set up in response to determining that a peer is close to the user device .

Once the peer matcher has identified a user device as a suitable peer device the media server sends instructions to the user device through the ISP network that cause the user device to contact user device across the local network . If the local network is not set up when the instructions to serve the media file are created instructions for the creation of the local network can be included. Alternatively the media server can send instructions to the user device these instructions not shown that cause the user device to contact the user device and retrieve the requested media file from the user device across the local network . In some implementations when no peer is identified the media server sends the media file to the media player .

The user device can retrieve the media file from a media library and send the media file to the user device through the local network . The media player can begin playing the media file. In some implementations the media file can be sent in blocks or an ordered stream and the media player can play a portion of the media file as the user device receives the media file . The media server can monitor the transfer of the media file from the user device to the user device . If a termination of the transfer is observed or expected for example because user device disconnects from isolated network the media server can send the full or remaining untransferred portions of the media file to the user device or locate another device on local network that is storing the media file and cause the other device to send the remaining portion to the user device .

In some implementations only devices that are associated with users that have opted into the media sharing service may be eligible for sharing media across a local network. In this case for example the media server may first determine whether the users of user device and user device have opted into the service before sending the instructions that cause the requested media file to be sent from user device to user device . The media server may make this determination by in response to receiving the request for the media file from user device that the user associated with the user device has opted into the service and then cause the peer matcher to limit the search for peer devices to those that have opted into the service. Alternatively the media server may cause the peer matcher to determine the possible peers and then eliminate those that are not associated with users that have opted into the media sharing service.

The following describes an example of an implementation of the system in use. A first user of a user device here a mobile telephone connected to a cellular data network is purchasing an audio file of a song for download and playback on the user s mobile telephone. The user is at a populated bus stop surrounded by other users of other computing devices that are connected to the same or other data networks.

The user loads a shopping application browses a catalog of recording artists and selects a song to purchases. The financial aspects of the purchase request are sent to a financial transaction server not shown here and the file specifications are sent to a media server over the cellular network.

A peer matcher searches for computing devices that are near the user s mobile telephone that have the purchases song stored and that have communication capabilities that are compatible with the user s mobile telephone. Communication capabilities can include a list of network protocols across which a device can communicate and the distance for which those protocols apply. The peer matcher can identify a second mobile phone that can communicate through a Bluetooth network and that is a meter away from the user s mobile telephone which can also communicate through a Bluetooth network.

The media server can send instructions over the cellular network to the second mobile phone to create a Bluetooth network between the two devices and and to transfer the media file to the user s mobile phone. The user s mobile phone can receive the media file from the other mobile device across the Bluetooth network and alert the media server over the cellular network when the media file is successfully received. The media file can be verified before or during this alert for example with a hash value generated from the media file . If the media file fails verification one or more times the media server can send instructions to one or both mobile telephones to sever the Bluetooth connection and the media server can send the song file to the user s mobile telephone through the cellular data network. Similarly the media server can send the song to the device through the cellular network if the other device disconnects from the Bluetooth network .

The following describes an example of another implementation of system in use. A first user of a user device here a laptop computer is connected to the ISP network here a cellular data network and is listening to music in the user s library which has been stored on a media server system . The user is at a park and other computing devices are nearby.

The user selects a song title to play in a media library application e.g. media player . The laptop computer generates a request for the media file that includes a unique identifier for the song. The request for the media file is sent to the media server system over the cellular data network. The peer matcher identifies the laptop computer and sets communication parameters for a peer search. The peer matcher has previously determined that the laptop computer can communicate through Bluetooth at a first distance and ad hoc Wi Fi at a second distance. The location of the laptop computer is determined by either the laptop computer or the peer matcher based on cell triangulation information provided by the cellular network . Alternatively or additionally a Global Positioning System unit may be included in the laptop to provide geographic location information for the laptop.

The peer matcher searches for peer devices that can communicate through Bluetooth within the first distance of the laptop device or that can communicate through ad hoc Wi Fi within the second distance. A second user device here a mobile phone is located within the first distance and the peer matcher verifies that the mobile phone can communicate through Bluetooth and stores the requested media file.

Instructions to serve the media file are generated with information about the requested media file and the laptop and sent to the mobile phone from the media server system over the cellular network. In response the mobile phone sets up an isolated network e.g. a Bluetooth network and offers a music file media file to the laptop computer. Upon completion of the transfer the laptop computer sends a message to the media server system over the cellular network with an alert about the completed transfer.

A media library that includes at least one media file and that is associated with a user is stored at a server system . For example a collection of media files can be stored to computer readable medium by the media server . The media server can create an index of the media library files referencing the media files by metadata such as artist title genre rating etc.

A request is received at the server system from a requesting device for a media file the requesting device sending the request in response to the user selecting the media file for output by the requesting computer device . For example the user device can request a particular media file or provide criteria for a class of media files to be output to the user of the user device and in response the user device can send a request for the media file to the media server . Alternatively or additionally the request can be part of a financial transaction such as a purchase or rental or a non financial request such as for ad supported or free media. The request can be transmitted from the user device to the media server through an internet connected local network or for example through a cellular network connection.

The server system determines whether the media file is stored on another device that is able to send the media file to the requesting device across a local network . For instance the peer matcher can perform a search for devices that can communicate through a local network with the requesting device. In some instances this includes searching for devices that are already connected to the local network with the requesting device. Alternatively or additionally this may include searching for devices that are not currently connected with the requesting device but that could communicate if a local network was created. For example the peer matcher can determine that the user device may be able to communicate with the user device on an internet connected network on an isolated network or on a network created by the user device or . In some examples the peer matcher can use the geographic locations of devices to determine if devices can communicate through a local network. In some examples the peer matcher can use the internal and external network addresses of user devices to determine if the user devices can communicate through a local network.

If one or more devices are found that can communicate through a local network with the requesting device those source devices are examined to determine if the source devices have the requested media file. For example the user device can be identified as a source device and the media library can be searched.

If no device is found that is able to send the media file to the requesting device across a local network the media file is served by the server system to the requesting device so that the requesting device can output the media file to a user . For example the media server can identify the media file in the media library and serve the file to the user device through the internet connection.

If a source device is found that is able to send the media file to the requesting device across a local network one or more commands are sent by the server to cause the source device to serve the media file to the requesting device so that the requesting device can output the media file to a user . Some or all of these commands can be sent to the source device the requesting device or both. For example instructions can be sent to one or both user devices and to initiate a network connection with the other device if one such network does not exist. Instructions can be sent to one or both user devices and to initiate a transfer of the media file from the user device to the user device .

The file transfer between the source device and the requesting device is monitored to determine whether a service interruption occurs . That the source computing device sends at least an initial portion of the media file to the requesting computer device across the local network but in some instances is unable to send the remaining portion of the media file across the local network. For example the media server can remain in communication with one or both user devices and to monitor the status of the file transfer. Alternatively or in addition one or both user devices and can report a successful or failed file transfer.

In response to determining that the source device is unable to send the remaining portion of the media file the remaining portion of the file is served by the server to the requesting device . For example if the first half of the media file is received by the user device when the user device is turned off or disconnected from the local network the media server can serve the second half of the media file to the user device . In some examples the media file is buffered and output to the user while it is being transferred. The file transfers from the user device and then from the media server can both be placed in the buffer and the media can be output to the user without interruption. In some implementations instead of serving the remaining portion of the file the server can identify a second source device and send a command to the second source device or requesting device to cause the second source device to serve the media file to the requesting device.

Referring now to a conceptual diagram of a system that may be used to implement the systems and methods described in this document is illustrated. Mobile computing device can wirelessly communicate with base station which can provide the mobile computing device wireless access to numerous services through a network .

In this illustration the mobile computing device is depicted as a handheld mobile telephone e.g. a smartphone or an application telephone that includes a touchscreen display device for presenting content to a user of the mobile computing device . The mobile computing device includes various input devices e.g. keyboard and touchscreen display device for receiving user input that influences the operation of the mobile computing device . In further implementations the mobile computing device may be a laptop computer a tablet computer a personal digital assistant an embedded system e.g. a car navigation system a desktop computer or a computerized workstation.

The mobile computing device may include various visual auditory and tactile user output mechanisms. An example visual output mechanism is display device which can visually display video graphics images and text that combine to provide a visible user interface. For example the display device may be a 3.7 inch AMOLED screen. Other visual output mechanisms may include LED status lights e.g. a light that blinks when a voicemail has been received .

An example tactile output mechanism is a small electric motor that is connected to an unbalanced weight to provide a vibrating alert e.g. to vibrate in order to alert a user of an incoming telephone call or confirm user contact with the touchscreen . Further the mobile computing device may include one or more speakers that convert an electrical signal into sound for example music an audible alert or voice of an individual in a telephone call.

An example mechanism for receiving user input includes keyboard which may be a full qwerty keyboard or a traditional keypad that includes keys for the digits 0 9 and . The keyboard receives input when a user physically contacts or depresses a keyboard key. User manipulation of a trackball or interaction with a trackpad enables the user to supply directional and rate of rotation information to the mobile computing device e.g. to manipulate a position of a cursor on the display device .

The mobile computing device may be able to determine a position of physical contact with the touchscreen display device e.g. a position of contact by a finger or a stylus . Using the touchscreen various virtual input mechanisms may be produced where a user interacts with a graphical user interface element depicted on the touchscreen by contacting the graphical user interface element. An example of a virtual input mechanism is a software keyboard where a keyboard is displayed on the touchscreen and a user selects keys by pressing a region of the touchscreen that corresponds to each key.
