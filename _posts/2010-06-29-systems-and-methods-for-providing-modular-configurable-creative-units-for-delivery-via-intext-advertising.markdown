This disclosure generally relates to the field of web page development in particular to tools for developing modular and configurable creative units for delivering to a web page providing intext advertising or related content.

An enterprise serving web pages to a user may wish to provide the user with an easier and quicker access to information the user is looking for. The services of the enterprise may aim to increase the user s satisfaction by decreasing the amount of time the user spends finding the relevant information. As the user searches the world wide web for the relevant information the user may often open many new web pages which do not include the relevant content. The user may become even more dissatisfied when the old web pages from which the user began searching are closed or lost during the search process. The enterprise may wish to provide the user with an option to find the relevant information without having to exit the current web page in order to access a next one which may or may not include the information the user is looking for.

Hypertext is a computer based text used in a web page to provide information to a user and organize the web page content into interconnected associations. These associations may enable the user to easily access information the user chooses or clicks. An instance of such an association is called a hyperlink or hypertext link. A hyperlink when selected leads the viewer to another web page or file or resource collectively called the destination page .

In order to access the supplemental information provided through hyperlinks viewers are required to leave their current web pages. This requirement interrupts the viewers web browsing experience. As a result most viewers are reluctant to visit the destination page provided by hyperlinks.

In addition traditionally the hyperlinks are generated by human editors a process that is both tedious and subject to human errors. Further by the time a viewer tries to visit a destination page of a hyperlink the destination page may cease to exist or have evolved to no longer provide the related information.

In some cases the viewer leaves the web page to visit a destination page that does not have information desired by the viewer. The user then may have to search for other destination pages to try to obtain the desired information. This may lead the viewer to perform multiple searches and visit several pages to find the desired information. The viewer may become dissatisfied with the amount of activity to find the desired information and with leaving the current destination page to do so.

Systems and methods of the present solution enable an enterprise such as a publisher agency or an advertiser to develop standardized tooltips or user overlay interfaces for display on remote clients using a user friendly software tool. Systems and methods of the present solution further relate to a development tool that enables users to design develop and generate a unit type comprising a tooltip that includes user and or keyword relevant content to be displayed over a web page accessed by a remote client in response to the client selection of a keyword of the web page. Systems and methods of the present solution enable designers or users of the development tool to more easily design the unit types by using modular components and templates to customize the unit types. The user may design the contents of the unit type with user selected modular media blocks along with other creative elements and arrangement of the same.

A user may select via the development tool a media block component to add to the unit type. The user may place the media block component on a layout of the unit type. The development tool may generate script code to define the layout of the unit type as a set of cells and rows within a predetermined sized container. The media block component may be placed in a cell and a row of the set of cells and rows. The script code may provide execution direction for rendering media of the media block component while displaying the unit type.

In some embodiments a user identifies via the development tool the unit type template comprising the tooltip with a predetermined set of design and functional elements. The user may create via the development tool the unit type based on the unit type template selected from a plurality of unit type templates.

A source data file e.g. a web page resides on a server e.g. a content provider on a network e.g. the Internet . The handler retrieves the source data file for augmentation by the augmentation server . The locator examines the retrieved source data file for comparison to data in the reference database . In one embodiment the locator analyzes content of the source data file for keywords searches corresponding reference data in the reference database and provides the keywords and the corresponding reference data to the analyzer . In an alternate embodiment rather than analyzing the source data file for keywords the locator retrieves a list of keywords from the reference database and enumerates through the textual content of the source data file for matches.

The analyzer creates associations between the keywords and the corresponding reference data found by the locator . The generator generates an augmented data file by embedding the associations created by the analyzer in the source data file . The generator embeds associations by generating intelligent tags for the keywords and augmenting the keywords with the intelligent tags. In one embodiment an intelligent tag is an alphabetic and or numeric string that identifies its associated keywords and or reference data and optionally includes an unique identification number hereinafter called the association ID . The generator inserts the generated intelligent tags into the source data file to generate the augmented data file . Web pages with the integrated intelligent tags are called augmented web pages. Keywords with the integrated intelligent tags are called augmented keywords. The generator also stores the identified keywords and or the associations in a database for later references.

The resulting augmented data file is returned to the handler to reside at a Universal Resource Locator URL address on the network e.g. at the content provider from which the source data file is retrieved . In one embodiment the handler also receives requests or signals from client computers indicating user interactions with the augmented data file and transmits to the client computers related advertisements for display through layered augmentation. Layered augmentation is described in detail below with respect to . The handler retrieves the activated keywords e.g. from the requests and determines one or more relevant advertisements from an advertising database not shown that matches the keywords and or the associated reference data. In one embodiment rather than transmitting the related advertisements the handler transmits addresses e.g. URLs of the relevant advertisements to the requesting client computer . The client computer resolves the addresses to retrieve the advertisements.

The reference database stores reference data such as types of advertisements e.g. television advertisements categories of advertisements e.g. storage rental home equity loan and or information about specific advertisements e.g. associated keywords format information price the advertiser is willing to pay and URL of the advertisement . The reference database may be a relational database or any other type of database that stores the data such as a flat file. In one embodiment the reference database is a web enabled reference database supporting remote calls through the Internet to the reference database .

The components of the augmentation server can reside on a single computer system or several computer systems located close by or remotely from each other. For example the analyzer and the generator may reside on separate web servers and the reference database may be located in a dedicated database server. In addition any of the components or sub components may be executed in one or multiple computer systems.

Web pages or web browsers can provide additional information to viewers. For example when a user places a mouse over a link label of a hyperlink a web browser displays the associated destination URL e.g. on a status bar of the web browser . As another example when a user places a pointer over a keyword the web browser may generate a pop up dialog box and display relevant information e.g. an explanation of the keyword . The process of providing additional information to web page viewers is called augmentation.

A keyword or phrase often has multiple aspects of related information each having multiple aspects of related information. For example the key phrase digital camera is related to its history underlying technology and available products and services. A specific product related to digital camera has related information such as product description customer review and competing products. Usually only one aspect of the related information is provided through augmentation due to limited display space.

Multiple aspects of related information can be arranged and provided to viewers through layered augmentation. Each aspect of related information can be assigned to one specific layer of the layered augmentation. Viewers can navigate among the multiple aspects of related information by accessing the different layers of the layered augmentation without leaving the web page. For example the augmented information can be displayed in a multi layered dialog box. A viewer can navigate among different layers by selecting associated tabs displayed in the dialog box in which each tab is associated with a layer. Alternatively the multiple layers may be stacked in a manner similar to windows in Microsoft Windows Operating System. The stacked layers may be arranged in a horizontal vertical or cascade style showing a small exposed portion of each layer such as a title area or a corner area. Navigation between each layer in the stack can be through selection of that small exposed portion of the layer within the stack. The process of providing additional information or resources through multi layered dialog box and the multi layered dialog box are collectively called layered augmentation.

By way of example the illustrated method may be embodied through instructions for performing the actions described herein and such instrumentations can be stored within a tangible computer readable medium and are executable by a processor. Alternatively or additionally the illustrated method may be implemented in modules like those in the augmentation server described above with respect to and or other entities such as the content providers and or the client computers . Furthermore those of skill in the art will recognize that other embodiments can perform the steps of the illustrated method in different order. Moreover other embodiments can include different and or additional steps than the ones described here.

At a block the method locates one or multiple pieces of reference data in the reference database corresponding to the piece of structured data read in the source data file e.g. through the locator . In one embodiment the locator searches for reference data in the reference database that match the piece of structured data by making function calls to the reference database . In one embodiment the structured data are keywords and the reference data also contain keywords.

Keywords are a facile and efficient means of generating layered augmentation. In addition to or instead of using keywords one embodiment uses a fuzzy expert or a neural network analysis of the source data file such as by a natural language search of the source data file to generate a distinct identifier for the content in the source data file . One advantage of a natural language search is the ability to better place content in context making links more contextually appropriate for instance security might relate to security of a physical plant such as security of a residence in one source data file in one context and security of a website in another. In one embodiment the method determines a context of the keywords and or the source data file based on statistical modeling e.g. through the locator . For example a context can be assigned a pre defined set of terms which acts as a fingerprint for the context hereinafter called context fingerprint . The locator can compare the context fingerprints associated with a collection of contexts with the terms within the source data file to determine a percentage match for each context in the collection. Where a high percentage match is achieved e.g. exceeding a pre defined percentage match threshold the locator determines that the associated context is the context for the source data file . Alternatively or in conjunction the locator may determine the context associated with the highest percentage match as the context for the source data file . The context can be used to locate corresponding reference data and or related resources.

At a block the method generates an association to the piece of structured data based upon the located matching reference data e.g. through the analyzer . In one embodiment a piece of reference data includes an identifier such as a keyword a context a unique identification number and or associated URL address es of intended destination resource s based upon the occurrence of the corresponding keywords in the source data file . Generating an association means to associate the piece of structured data located in the source data file with the located reference data in the reference database . The generated association might optionally include additional identification codes such as an association ID. The method then augments the original source data file with the generated association at a block to generate an augmented data file e.g. through the generator .

In one embodiment the method expresses the association as intelligent tags e.g. through the generator . The method generates intelligent tags for the located keywords and tags the keywords with the generated intelligent tags. The intelligent tags contain information about the associated keywords such as the keyword and related context and information about the associated reference data such as IDs that uniquely identify the reference data in the reference database . For example the intelligent tags may contain requirement or preference information about advertisements or other types of resources to be associated with the keyword such as types of advertisements and a minimum advertisement fee. In one embodiment the intelligent tags also format the augmented keywords differently than the other textual content in the augmented web pages. Having generated the augmented data file the method then terminates at a block .

In one embodiment the augmentation server or the content providers also augments the web pages by including computer code hereinafter called client code to monitor and report viewers interactions with the augmented keywords. The computer code can be in any computer language such as JavaScript. Additional functions of the client code are described in detail below with respect to .

The augmented data file can be delivered or transmitted to client computers for display through a web browser to viewers to provide related resources through layered augmentation. The delivery of the augmented data file and the process to provide layered augmentation is described in detail below with respect to . For purpose of illustration the method is described in terms of web pages augmented with advertisements even though the disclosed embodiments apply to other types of augmented data file and resources.

Referring now to a flowchart illustrating an example process or method for providing layered augmentation to viewers of augmented web pages. As illustrated the method transmits an augmented web page to a client computer. For example a user of the client computer may enter the URL of an augmented web page or the corresponding original web page in the address bar of a conventional web browser e.g. Microsoft Internet Explorer Mozilla Firefox or Apple Safari . The web browser of the client computer hereinafter called the client web browser resolves the URL and transmits a request for the web page to a corresponding content provider. Responding to the request the content provider transmits the augmented web page to the client web browser for display. In one embodiment the client web browser displays augmented keywords in a double underline style and or in a color distinctive from text that is not augmented in the augmented web page.

The method receives an intelligent tag request from the client computer . As described above with respect to the augmented web page contains client code that monitors user interactions with augmented keywords. In one embodiment if the user moves a pointer e.g. a pointer controlled by a mouse navigation button or touchpad over a mouse over an augmented keyword the activated keyword the client code which may be integrated with the web browser for example as a plug in applet generates an intelligent tag request and transmits the request to the augmentation server . The request indicates the mouse over user activity to the augmentation server . The request may contain information that uniquely identifies the activated keyword e.g. an association ID and or other information such as the activated keyword itself.

The method determines advertisements relevant to the activated keyword for the received request based on the keyword and or the associated reference data. In one embodiment the augmentation server extracts the keyword and or related context from the request retrieves the associated reference data from the reference database and determines the relevant advertisements by searching in an advertisement database using the keyword and or requirements set forth in the associated reference data e.g. advertisement category context fee requirements etc. .

In one embodiment the method determines the advertisements that match the best e.g. matching the activated keyword and or satisfies the most number of reference requirements as the relevant advertisements. In another embodiment the method determines relevant advertisements based on a context of the augmented web page and or the activated keyword. For example for a key phrase digital camera in an article about digital camera the method may determines the following resources as relevant a product review of a digital camera in CNET.com a collection of user reviews at Buy.com and a selection of similar digital cameras. The context can be determined when the activated keyword is identified in method .

In one embodiment the method determines a sequence for the related advertisements. The top advertisement in the sequence also called the default advertisement or the primary advertisement is the advertisement being displayed on the top layer of the layered augmentation. The lower ranked advertisements also called secondary advertisements are made available on lower layers of the layered augmentation. In one embodiment the method uses a bidding system to determine related advertisements sequence. For example for a key phrase digital camera there may be multiple related advertisements e.g. advertisements for different brands or models of digital cameras each having a bid or budget or cost for the key phrase. The method may determine a sequence of the advertisements based on their bids the one with the highest bid ranked the highest and so on.

In another embodiment the method may determine the sequence of multiple advertisements based on factors other than bidding prices. For example the method may consider factors such as relationships among the multiple advertisements e.g. prioritizing video advertisements over text ones prior user interactions with the advertisements e.g. prioritizing advertisements with higher interacting rate and contexts of the augmented keyword e.g. prioritizing advertisements from retailers or service providers having branches near a geographical context of the keyword and or the augmented web page or geographic locations of a substantial portion of viewers of the web page .

Further specific sequences may be set for specific keywords and or parties e.g. content providers advertisers users . For example if the keyword s is a music artist or band album name the method may make available his songs e.g. playback through an embedded music player on the top layer and other resources on lower layers. As another example if the keyword s is a location name e.g. Yellowstone National Park the method may make available the relevant map e.g. MapQuest Map on the top layer. As noted above the resources made available through the layered augmentation need not to be advertisements and can be related contents such as related articles videos images music to name only a few. For example a content provider may specify that the layered augmentations in its web pages make available a set of links to its other relevant web pages e.g. within the same website where the keyword s being augmented is cross indexed.

In one embodiment viewers can set their preferences to determine a preferred sequence for the layered augmentation. For example a viewer may prefer video advertisements while another may disfavor them e.g. due to bandwidth constrains at receiving device . As a result the method may place video advertisements higher on a sequence for the first viewer while not consider video advertisements for augmentation for the second viewer. Viewer preferences can be stored in a database such as the reference database along with other viewer related data e.g. profile data .

The method transmits the relevant advertisements to the client computer for display. In one embodiment the method retrieves the advertisements from an advertisement database and transmits them to the client web browser or the client computer for display. Alternatively the method may transmit references of the advertisements e.g. their URLs to the client web browser for retrieval.

In one embodiment the method generates computer code hereinafter called the advertisement code to facilitate user interaction with the advertisements. Similar to the client code the advertisement code can be in any computer language such as JavaScript. The advertisement code may display the relevant advertisements in a multi layered dialog box or popup box when the viewer moves a pointer over the activated keyword. The method transmits the generated advertisement code along with the related advertisements to the client web browser. In one embodiment the advertisement code is a part of the client code and is integrated in the augmented web page when the page is generated

The client web browser displays the relevant advertisements in a layered dialog box proximate to the activated keywords or the position where the mouse over is occurring as an in page overlay. In one embodiment the client web browser utilizes the advertisement code to display the advertisements in a multi layered dialog box. The advertisements are displayed according to their sequence. In one embodiment only the top advertisement is displayed and the lower ranked advertisements are represented by selectable tabs. An example process of the operation of the advertisement code and the client code is described in detail below with respect to .

Referring now to a flowchart illustrating an example process or method of the client code and or the advertisement code. As illustrated the method determines whether a pointer is positioned over an augmented keyword the activated keyword and if so sets the primary advertisement as the active advertisement and displays the active advertisement in a multi layered dialog box overlaying the augmented web page in a position proximate to the activated keyword or the mouse over. The multi layered dialog box also displays multiple selectable e.g. clickable tabs representing the lower layers. The viewer can select a tab to request the multi layered dialog box to display the corresponding layer. If the user selected a tab the method sets the advertisement corresponding to the selected layer as the active advertisement and displays it in place of the previously displayed advertisement.

The viewer can also interact with the currently displayed advertisement by selecting the advertisement. If the viewer selects the advertisement the method responds to the user selection based on the nature of the user selection and the configuration of the advertisement. For example if the user clicks on the active advertisement the method redirects the web browser to a web page related to the active advertisement. Alternatively if the user drags a scrollbar displayed on the dialog box the method displays different portions of the active advertisement as the user drags along the scrollbar. In one embodiment if the viewer moves the pointer away from the activated keyword and or the multi layered dialog box for an extended period of time the method hides the dialog box.

Referring back to in one embodiment rather than displaying multiple advertisements the method displays multiple aspects or portions of the same advertisement in the multi layered dialog box. For example the multi layered dialog box may display an image and brief description of a product and present two tabs one for user reviews and the other for playback of a television advertisement of the product. The viewer may interact with the advertisement through the multi layered dialog box without having to navigate away from and otherwise leave the current web page the viewer is interacting with in the web browser. For example if the advertisement contains video the multi layered dialog box may overlay the video with video controls e.g. forward rewind play pause volume etc. . The multi layered dialog box may also provide functional resources such as web searches enabling viewers to conduct web searches and or review search results without leaving the augmented web page.

The method tracks the received requests the advertisements displays and or the user s interactions with the advertisements. These activities may be logged in a database e.g. the reference database or reported to another device or person e.g. via electronic mail .

The methods described above with respect to are illustrated below in an example together with accompanying screenshots in . Initially the augmentation server retrieves a web page for augmentation. The web page may contain textual content of any subject. shows an example of the web page as displayed in Microsoft Internet Explorer . As shown in the web page is retrieved from website www.computing.net and contains a paragraph about computer virus.

The augmentation server reads the web page for keywords. The augmentation server identifies the keyword security for layered augmentation. The augmentation server locates a piece of reference data matching the keyword security and determines a context of computer security for the keyword . The piece of reference data includes an advertisement category for computer security services. The augmentation server generates an association of the keyword security and the located piece of reference data.

The augmentation server augments the web page by generating an intelligent tag encoding the generated association and integrating the intelligent tag in an augmented web page . The augmentation server also includes in the augmented web page JavaScript code client code that captures user interactions with the augmented keyword .

A web browser running on a client computer retrieves the augmented web page and displays it to a user e.g. responding to the user entering an URL of the web page or in the address bar of the web browser . illustrates a screenshot of the augmented web page as displayed on an Internet Explorer web browser after it is retrieved by the browser. It is noted that in the augmented keyword is displayed in a double underline style to distinguish from conventional hyperlinks that are single underlined.

Subsequently the user may move a pointer e.g. controlled by a mouse stylus or touchpad over the double underlined augmented keyword the activated augmented keyword . This user action is also referred to as a mouse over. Detecting the mouse over the embedded JavaScript code the client code in the augmented web page or the web browser generates an intelligent tag request that uniquely identifies the activated augmented keyword and or the related context and transmits the request to the augmentation server . The augmentation server receives the request retrieves stored association of the keyword and determines relevant advertisements by searching for advertisements corresponding to the keyword and or the related context in an advertising database. In the present example the augmentation server determines that an advertisement for Cisco security center is the relevant advertisement associated with the augmented keyword .

The augmentation server determines a sequence of various parts of the Cisco advertisement and or other relevant advertisements. In the present example the augmentation server determines that a description of the Cisco security center ranks top in the sequence followed by its customer reviews and a list of competing services.

The augmentation server transmits the related advertisement s back to the web browser for display. The augmentation server also transmits JavaScript code advertisement code that enables layered representation of the transmitted advertisements.

The web browser or the advertisement code displays the received advertisement s as an overlay in a multi layered dialog box in proximity to the keyword or the location where the mouse over occurred. As illustrated in the user has moved a mouse pointer over the keyword . As a result the web browser receives advertisements related to the keyword security and displays them in a multi layered dialog box proximate to the pointer.

As illustrated the multi layered dialog box displays an advertisement about CISCO security center. On the bottom of the multi layered dialog box are two tabs labeled Click to view customer review and Click to view alternative services respectively. Note that this is consistent with the sequence of the advertisements and or advertisement portions determined by the augmentation server . The user can navigate the advertisements within the multi layered dialog box by clicking the labeled tabs. The user can also visit the corresponding advertiser s web page by clicking the advertisement. While the user navigates within the multi layered dialog box the augmented web page remains as the current web page displayed in the client web browser. The user can quickly resume browsing the rest of the augmented web page .

As illustrated in when the user clicks or mouse over the tab labeled Click to view customer review the multi layered dialog box displays customer reviews for Cisco security center. It is noted that the label on the tab representing customer review changes to Click to hide customer review. The user can click the tab to resume viewing the previous advertisement for Cisco security center.

As illustrated in when the user clicks the Cisco security center advertisement the advertisement code redirects the client web browser to the advertiser s web page in this case a web page related to Cisco security center.

The ad server platform may match the keywords from the site keyword list to keywords in the content from the page. The ad server platform may assign each matching keyword a relevancy weight.

Referring now to an embodiment of assigning a relevancy weight to each keyword to provide contextual targeting is depicted. The ad server platform may provide a relevancy weight to each keyword of the site keyword list matching content of the web page. The ad server platform may use any type and form of metrics or combinations of metrics to determine a relevancy weight. In some embodiments the ad server platform uses a location frequency and or length metric to assign a relevancy weight to the matching keyword. The location relevancy weight may comprise an indicator or multiplier to those keywords that appear near the beginning or top of the web page relevant to those keywords that appear near the end of bottom of the web page. The frequency relevancy weight may comprise an indicator or multiplier to those keywords that appear more times on the same page or content than other keywords. The length relevancy weight may comprise an indicator or multiplier to those keywords that have more words in the keywords than single keyword or keywords with less words.

Each type of metric relevancy weight may be weighted the same or differently. Each metric relevancy weight may have it owns multiplier or factor that scales the weight for the keyword up or down according to the relevancy. The keyword may be up weighted and or down weighted one or more times by each of the metric relevancy weights. A keyword relevancy weight may be up weighted by one metric relevancy weight while downloaded by another relevancy weight. For example a keyword may be repeated several times and be upweighted or have a high multiplier based on the frequency relevancy weight while only found and repeated near the end of the page for a down weighting or low multiplier from the location relevancy weight. In some embodiments a keyword may get a low relevancy weighting from each of the metric relevancy weightings. In some embodiments a keyword may get a high relevancy weighting from each of the metric relevancy weightings. In some embodiments a keyword may get a combination of low and high relevancy weightings from different relevancy weightings.

Referring now to an embodiment of applying behavioral targeting is depicted. The ad server platform may identify track and store formation about a user s behavior in a behavioral profile.

In some embodiments the ad server platform tracks terms of one or more search results from which the user has clicked through. In some embodiments the ad server platform tracks viewed terms over a predetermined time period. In some embodiments the ad server platform tracks viewed terms over a start of a behavioral profile of the user to current time.

The ad server platform may use any of the search terms and or viewed terms from the behavioral profile to make a change to the relevancy weightings of the matching keywords. Those matching keywords that the use has searched or viewed previously will have their relevancy weightings increased or upweighted via a behavioral targeting multiplier. In some embodiments the ad server platform may use a combination of recently searched and viewed terms to apply a multiplier to each matching keyword. The ad server platform may use any temporal threshold to determine which search terms and or viewed terms to use for determining a multiplier to the relevancy weightings of the matching keywords. The ad platform may apply higher behavioral targeting multipliers to those keywords that were recently viewed and or recently search within a predetermined time history. The ad platform may apply no or lower behavioral targeting multipliers to those keywords that were not recently viewed and or not recently search within the predetermined time history.

As a result of using behavioral profile data and behavioral targeting multipliers as depicted in the ad server platform modifies the relevancy of the matching keywords from the site keyword list. The matching keywords are assigned a first relevancy weighting from the contextual targeting and are modified or changed to a second relevancy weighting from the behavioral targeting. In some embodiments the ad server platform maintains both the contextual targeting relevancy weightings and the behavioral targeting relevancy weighting for each matching keyword. In some embodiments the ad server platform maintains a single relevancy weighting keyword comprising the behavioral targeting multipliers up weighting or down weighting to the relevancy weighting applied by the contextual targeting.

Referring to an embodiment of campaign selection is depicted. In some embodiments the results of contextual and or behavioral targeting are used as input to the campaign selection engine. The ad server platform may use the relevancy weightings of the matching keywords from the site keyword list to determine which campaigns may be applicable to these matching keywords. Those campaigns not having keywords corresponding to any of the matching keywords may be dropped from consideration. In some embodiments those campaigns not having a number of keywords corresponding to the matching keywords within a predetermined threshold may be dropped from consideration. In some embodiments those campaigns having one or more keywords corresponding to a predetermined number of the top relevancy weighted keywords may be identified for consideration.

The ad server platform may order the list of campaigns under consideration using any type and form of algorithm. For example the ad server platform may rank the campaigns based on having matching keywords with the highest combined relevancy weightings. the ad server platform may rank the campaigns based on having the highest number of matching keywords. The ad server platform may rank the campaigns based on a combination of the highest combined relevancy weightings and the highest number of matching keywords. The ad server platform may also order campaigns based on any type of priorities assigned to the campaigns. Some campaigns may have a high order of priority to deliver or serve than other campaigns.

The ad server platform may selected the campaigns to deliver from the ordered or ranked list of campaigns. The ad server platform may further restrict the selection based on any rules or policies of the ad server platform the publisher or the campaign. For example the campaign or publisher may have rules restricting the serving of a campaign directed to certain users times of days locations browsers or content. Once the selection of the one or more campaigns is made the ad server platform generates a list of campaign keywords to hook and transmits these keywords to the agent of the client. The ad server platform may provide to the agent information on the publisher campaign tooltip user interface overlay and or augmented content with or corresponding to the keyword.

In one example the hooked keyword may be located in the top right corner of the screen. The tooltip of the unit type may in such instances be placed below and to the left of the hooked keyword. Tail of the tooltip may be placed on the towards the top right side of the unit type and pointed to the hooked keyword. Similarly arrangement and placement of both the unit type and tail of the tooltip may vary based on the location of the hooked keyword.

In some embodiments there are multiple set locations with respect to the hooked keyword in which unit type may be located. In one embodiment unit type is positioned above and to the right of the hooked keyword. In one embodiment unit type is positioned above and to the left of the hooked keyword. In one embodiment unit type is positioned below and to the right of the hooked keyword. In one embodiment unit type is positioned below and to the left of the hooked keyword. Priority of different positions may be determined based on the content of the page . In some embodiments position of the unit type is determined based on the content that falls beneath each of the tooltip positions. For example when choosing the location in which to display the unit type unit type may be positioned to the right and above of the hooked keyword in response to a determination that a movie content a flash content or a graphical content would be blocked if the unit type was positioned differently.

Tooltip positioning algorithm illustrated by may take in consideration four different locations of the tooltip of the unit type such as the top left top right bottom left and bottom right positions with respect to the keyword. The tooltip positioning algorithm may decide if the content which the tooltip would block is an area of the web page to avoid displaying the tooltip on. If the area of the web page is determined to be avoided then the next position for placing the tooltip is sought. The areas determined to be avoided may be referred to as the avoidance nodes. Tooltip positioning algorithm may be comprised within the development tool . Tooltip positioning algorithm may determine created and included into the output file by the unit type generator . Tooltip positioning algorithm may be deployed together with the unit type to the client and be loaded and used while displaying unit type on the client computer .

Because this embodiment of the tooltip positioning algorithm picks only from four positions within which the unit type may be displayed there is a possibility that all four choices may be undesirable. In order to resolve any conflicts a weight may be assigned to each of the avoidance nodes. The weight of the avoidance nodes may indicate which areas are more important to avoid than others. For example areas with iframes flash movies videos or graphical content may be more important to avoid than text. In other embodiments text is more important to avoid than a picture. An avoidance list may be used to indicate the criteria for assigning the weight and avoiding areas. The avoidance list may include a description of a node to avoid such as an area or a particular content and the importance weight to be assigned to any such node.

Tooltip positioning algorithm may operate in accordance with a set of steps. In one step a tooltip positioning algorithm may calculate the avoidance total for each position state. In another step a tooltip positioning algorithm may also calculate a list of avoidance nodes for each position state. In yet another step tooltip positioning algorithm checks each position state for zero avoidance nodes or nodes on which the tooltip may be displayed freely without any avoidance weight. If a position state with zero avoidance node is found tooltip is placed within such area. If no position state with zero nodes is found tooltip positioning algorithm may set avoidance weight level AWL to Text 0. Tooltip positioning algorithm may check each position state for zero avoidance nodes that have avoidance weight equal to the AWL. If a position state is found to satisfy such request tooltip may be placed. If a position is not found tooltip positioning algorithm may check for other possibilities. Other possibilities may include locations which should be avoided or have an assigned weight of avoidance but which are weighted less than other locations which should also be avoided. In such instances an area that is weighted least may be picked as the area in which the tooltip will be placed.

In instances in which there are no available areas within which the tooltip may be placed a determination may be made of whether or not the AWL is equal to max avoidance weight. In some embodiments the tooltip may be simply placed above and to the right of the hooked keyword. In other embodiments a determination is made whether or not an AWL for a particular position is smaller than the maximum avoidance weight of all possible locations within which the tooltip may be placed. If such AWL for a position is found to be smaller than the maximum avoidance weight a determination may be made to see if any other position state has a weight of avoidance that is smaller than the AWL. If such a position is found then the location with least important content to cover with tooltip is identified and the tooltip may be placed in this location. If no preferred location is found tooltip may be placed above and to the right of the keyword.

Avoidance list identify nodes to be avoided while positioning the tooltip or unit type . Avoidance list may identify which contents to avoid and what weight to assign to each content in order to determine which content should be avoided more than other. In one embodiment iframe may be identified as an area to avoid. In another embodiment an object or an embed tag comprising media or flash movies may be avoided. In further embodiments avoidance list identifies script parameters or contents to avoid. Object to avoid may also include or be associated with rules instructions tags or names that may be used by the tooltip positioning algorithm.
