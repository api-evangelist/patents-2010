At block the authentication or activation system may provide an authentication acceptance to the media manager . For example after the processing module verifies the authentication token provided by the user of the media manager the processing module may provide an authentication acceptance to the media manager . After providing an authentication acceptance to the media manager the method may proceed to block .

At block the authentication or activation system may receive authentication fingerprint of the media manager . For example upon receiving authentication acceptance from the authentication or activation system the media manager may generate an authentication fingerprint and provide the authentication fingerprint to the input output I O module of the authentication or activation system . For example the authentication fingerprint may be generated based at least in part on the workstation of the media manager . For example the authentication fingerprint may be generated based at least in part on an image a microprocessor chip serial number a media access control MAC address operating system serial number a seed a unique randomized number or a combination of unique features of the workstation of the media manager . Also the authentication fingerprint may be generated based least in part on address information e.g. IP address uniform resource identifiers URIs uniform resource locators URLs private electronic mail addresses physical address telephone number or other address information of the workstation of the media manager .

The input output I O module may provide the authentication fingerprint to the media manager module and stored. The media manager module may store the authentication fingerprint in order to track a number of authentication fingerprints associated with the user of the media manager . After receiving authentication fingerprint from the media manager the method may proceed to block .

At block the authentication or activation system may request a DTCP request from the media manager . For example the media manager may provide a request for DTCP certificate to the authentication or activation system . The request for DTCP certificate may include the authentication fingerprint of the workstation hosting the media manager . The input output module may receive the request for DTCP certificate from the media manager via a transport layer security TLS protocol or secure sockets layer SSL protocol. After receiving a DTCP request from the media manager the method may proceed to block .

At block the authentication or activation system may verify user information of the user of the media manager . For example the processing module may retrieve user information associated with the user of the media manager based at least in part on the request for the DTCP certificate from the database module . For example the user information associated with the user of the media manager may include may include name address account number telephone number email address billing information a set top boxes STB e.g. a serial number or an identification number a digital video recorder DVR e.g. serial number or an identification number a consumer electronic device CE e.g. serial number or an identification number cable modem router or other equipments associated with the user of the media manager .

The processing module may determine whether the user qualifies for the DTCP certificate based at least in part on the user information associated with the user of the media manager . In an exemplary embodiment the processing module may determine that the user of the media manager has a digital video recorder DVR and may need a DTCP certificate in order to access various contents stored in the digital video recorder DVR . In another exemplary embodiment the processing module may determine that the user of the media manager does not have a digital video recorder DVR and may not need a DTCP certificate to access contents stored in the digital video recorder DVR . After verifying user information of the user of the media manager the method may proceed to block .

At block the authentication or activation system may provide a DTCP certificate request to the DTCP certificate system . The input output I O module may provide the DTCP certificate request received from the media manager to the DTCP certificate system . In an exemplary embodiment the DTCP certificate system may be associated with a content provider. In another exemplary embodiment the DTCP certificate system may be associated with a third party DTCP certificate provider e.g. Digital Transmission Licensing Administrator DTLA . After providing DTCP certificate request to the DTCP certificate system the method may proceed to block .

At block the authentication or activation system may receive the DTCP certificate. For example upon receiving the DTCP certificate request the DTCP certificate system may generate a DTCP certificate based at least in part on the DTCP certificate request. The DTCP certificate system may provide the DTCP certificate to the input output I O module of the authentication or activation system . The input output I O module may provide the DTCP certificate to the DTCP certificate module and stored. After receiving the DTCP certificate the method may proceed to block .

At block the authentication or activation system may provide the DTCP certificate and user information to the media manager . For example the input output I O module may provide the DTCP certificate to the media manager . The input output I O module may access the database module to provide user information associated with user of the media manager to the media manager along with the DTCP certificate. For example the input output I O module may access the database module to provide set top boxes STB information e.g. a serial number or an identification number a digital video recorder DVR information e.g. serial number or an identification number or a consumer electronic device CE information e.g. serial number or an identification number to the media manager along with the DTCP certificate. The input output I O module may encrypt the DTCP certificate and the user information associated with the user of the media manager in order to prevent tempering or unauthorized access of the DTCP certificate and the user information associated with the user of the media manager . After providing the DTCP certificate and the user information to the media manger the method may proceed to block .

In the preceding specification various preferred embodiments have been described with references to the accompanying drawings. It will however be evident that various modifications and changes may be made thereto and additional embodiments may be implemented without departing from the broader scope of invention as set forth in the claims that follow. The specification and drawings are accordingly to be regarded in an illustrative rather than restrictive sense.
