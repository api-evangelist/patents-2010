title: Providing access to quality indicators for natural resources
abstract: One or more natural resources (e.g., bodies of water, volumes of air or earth, mineral deposits, or wildlife populations) may be tracked by one or more natural resource quality sensors, each of which may detect and report various natural resource quality indicators (e.g., indicators of purity, biological or chemical contaminants, physical properties, and indicators of various components of a processing facility managing the natural resource, such as a water supply system). These indicators may be reported to one or more natural resource servers, which may store the indicators and, upon request of one or more users, generate a natural resource quality report indicating the quality of various natural resources. Reports may also be generated spontaneously and delivered as an alert based upon alert criteria (e.g., upon detecting a water height in a river correlated with flooding, a natural resource server may notify users residing near the river).

Within the field of computing many scenarios relate to a natural resources located within and between the hydrosphere water geosphere lithosphere crust mantle and core atmosphere air and biosphere the living part of Earth such as a body or quantity of water a volume of soil or air a food produced a mineral deposit a population of wildlife or a nature preserve such as a park. Such natural resources may have naturally arisen within an environment e.g. a naturally formed lake may have been artificially created within an environment e.g. naturally occurring plants existing within a manmade crop field or glasshouse greenhouse or may exist in a controlled facility e.g. a naturally occurring body of water existing within a water supply system . Many computing techniques relate to automated systems configured to track measure and or manage various parameters relating to such natural resources. For example centralized and or distributed systems may include sensors that detect quality indicators relating to a body of water such as the volume of water physical properties e.g. temperature pressure state of matter and flow rates and directions chemical properties e.g. purity components such as minerals present in a spring and contaminants such as pollutants biological properties e.g. wildlife present in a lake or biological contaminants such as bacteria and microbes that are present in a drinking water supply system and or artificial properties e.g. a unit cost associated with a natural resource that may be available for purchase .

With regard to such natural resources properties of various management systems may also be tracked. For example a water distribution system may comprise a complex set of processing components and the layout operating conditions and functions of various components may be tracked as relating to the quality indicators of the treated water. Such systems may be centralized distributed and or autonomous e.g. various supervisory control and data acquisition SCADA industrial control systems may be utilized to manage and control the treatment analysis and distribution process applied to a volume of water delivered to users.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

The tracking and reporting of quality indicators of a large and varied body of natural resources is often performed in ways that are difficult to evaluate. Additionally such quality indicators are often not online and or available in realtime. As a first example a natural resource may be tracked in a proprietary database that is not widely and promptly available to the public. As a second example the quality indicators for various natural resources may be reported in a manner that is inconsistent or difficult to compare between different natural resources by different agencies and or for particular uses. For example for a set of three analogous natural resources the quality indicators for a first natural resource may be reported in a prosaic manner that is human readable but not automatically parsed the quality indicators for a second natural resource may be reported with a first data set that is not human readable and the quality indicators for a third natural resource may be reported with a second data set comprising a different time scale level of detail and or report semantics that are difficult to compare with the first data set. As a third example different agencies may report quality indicators for different natural resources through different sources and or protocols e.g. the quality indicators for a first natural resource may be reported via email the quality indicators for a second natural resource may be reported via instant text message and the quality indicators for a third natural resource may be published to a website and a comparison or aggregation of this information may be difficult to perform without the involvement of a human researcher who is proficient and knowledgeable about these sources and types of reports. As a result of these properties it may be difficult for an ordinary individual to utilize these data sources to receive information regarding various queries such as the locations and availability of water and the quality at the position of uses of different sources of water. The reported information may also be reported in a manner that is overly technical complex and or obscure for use by ordinary individuals. The reported information may also be obsolete.

The present disclosure relates to techniques for presenting quality indicators of natural resources in a manner that promotes the accessibility promptness standardization and consistency and detail and quality of such information. These techniques may improve the accessibility understandability and usefulness of information by the members of a population and completeness of quality indicators for institutions and businesses that may utilize the data for further processing and presentation. In accordance with the present techniques users of the systems presented herein may be able to identify the natural resources in a particular area and a varied set of quality indicators relating thereto such as the availability cost volume and physical chemical and or biological properties of various bodies of water in a region. Additionally users of such systems may be able to compare different properties of different natural resources and or may be able to utilize automated processes agents that may perform sophisticated analyses of the data representing the quality indicators of various natural resources for the evaluation and comparison thereof.

In view of these ends the techniques presented herein relate to the configuration of information tracking and reporting systems regarding various natural resources. In accordance with these techniques the various management systems for such natural resources may be characterized holistically as a body of natural resource quality sensors that detect and transmit various types of quality indicators regarding various natural resources and a set of natural resource servers that accept such. The natural resource quality sensors may be distributed centrally or locally managed or may be configured to operate in an autonomous manner e.g. tightly or loosely coupled or built in natural resource and may perform different levels of evaluation of such natural resources e.g. a first sensor may transmit raw data for a natural resource such as basic data about the chemical ingredients of a body of water while a second sensor may evaluate such data and may transmit deduced information about the body of water such as the classification of chemical components as minerals or pollutants and the fitness of the water for consumption . The natural resource quality sensors may also encode metadata relating to the quality indicators such as a representation of the date and time of the detected quality indicator and a geocode indicating the location of the natural resource at the time of detection.

The natural resource quality sensors report such quality indicators to one or more natural resource servers each of which may be configured to accept quality indicators from a particular set of natural resource quality sensors including sensors configured to detect different types of natural resource quality indicators relating to a natural resource and or configured to detect natural resource quality indicators for different natural resources. The natural resource servers therefore aggregate the information reported by the natural resource quality sensors in order to represent a comprehensive body of quality data from one or more natural resources. Such natural resource quality indicators may be stored e.g. in a database and additional evaluative processes on such natural resource quality indicators may be performed. Additionally the natural resource servers are configured to respond to requests to generate a report for the natural resource quality indicators of one or more natural resources. These reports may comprise various types of data e.g. human readable reports such as documents charts and maps and or data sets that may be evaluated by various processes and may be reported promptly upon the request of a user and or as a notification or alert that is automatically delivered to one or more monitoring users upon detecting the satisfaction of a set of one or more alert criteria regarding a particular natural resource. In this manner quality indicators of natural resources may be traced and reported about pollutions emissions and contaminants impacts on human health and life safe as per user location and may be managed in an open database for ecological and carbon footprints. These techniques therefore permit individuals to investigate evaluate through automated processes and remain informed regarding the quality indicators of one or more natural resources in a position shape area or region of interest.

To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects advantages and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.

The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident however that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.

This patent application is related to Slovenian patent application no. P 201000141 entitled System and method for geocoded contents preparation from a plurality of location base elements for geoaware services information computing filed on May 7 2010 which is incorporated by reference as if fully rewritten herein.

Within the field of computing many scenarios relate to the tracking identification and reporting of one or more natural resources. Such natural resources are often inanimate such as a body or quantity of water a volume of soil rock or air or a mineral deposit but may also be living such as a population of one or more animals or plants. These natural resources may also arise naturally in an unmanaged condition e.g. a naturally forming lake or river an area of earth not inhabited by humans or a wildlife population may have been artificially created or managed within a natural environment e.g. a manmade lake a river managed by a dam or other control mechanism or a wildlife population in a nature preserve or park or may exist in a controlled facility e.g. a volume of water stored in a reservoir or water tower and distributed through the water network a volume of air around industrial sites or heavy traffic zones or maintained by a climate control system within a building or a wildlife population maintained in a zoological preserve .

In relation to such natural resources one or more location based systems may be devised to track various qualities impacts and dangers of the natural resource. As a first example a body of water such as an area of an ocean river lake pond or stream may be tracked to identify various contaminants of a chemical or biological nature that may affect the suitability of the water for drinking hygiene cleaning swimming or fishing. Alternatively or additionally various physical properties of the body of water may be tracked such as quantity temperature state of matter e.g. water steam or various forms of ice or snow pressure and flow rate and direction which may be used to manage the body of water through various automated or human control systems. Such water tracking systems may be utilized e.g. by a water treatment and distribution facility that is devised to provide a clean water supply for a population. As a second example a volume of air may be monitored to detect various quantities and compositions of pollutants e.g. from smokestacks operated by various industrial factories in order to assess the effect on the environment the health of individuals located in the area or compliance with industrial regulations. As a third example a sensor network may be configured to monitor a managed population of wildlife such as deer in a nature preserve or fish in a body of water and may report relevant factors such as number location size health and behavioral habits. Additional types of quality indicators may relate to abstract properties of the natural resource e.g. a unit price assigned to a particular resource available for sale to the public or a subjective taste evaluation of the water of a natural spring . Such types of quality indicators relating to the quality of the natural resource may be detected by one or more sensors of the tracking system e.g. a chemical or biological sensor immersed in a body of water an air sampling device positioned within an airflow location of a volume of air or a radiofrequency identification RFID tracking system configured to receive information from tracking tags attached to wildlife that indicate the location and health of the wildlife or may be reported by humans.

The quality indicators collected by various sensors may be of value to various individuals. In particular a population of a state may wish to examine the quality indicators detected in relation to various local natural resources in order to utilize such natural resources in daily life e.g. for determining where to obtain water for drinking and hygiene for determining the composition and contaminants of soil on which to grow crops and for determining the composition and health effects of air in a particular region in order to select a residence . Indeed in view of the ubiquity sophistication and affordability of automated systems in the modern information age the tracking and reporting of quality indicators of natural resources used by a population might be considered a basic human right to be offered and protected by a government. These quality indicators may also be useful for industrial agents e.g. an industrial operation may wish to monitor the availability and quality of natural resources utilized in a manufacturing process to protect the integrity of the manufactured goods and or to monitor the effects of the industrial operation on the availability and composition of the natural resource academic agents e.g. environmentalists may use the quality indicators of various resources to study historic changes of a natural resource or the ecological relationships and effects of various natural resources and regulatory agents e.g. an environmental regulatory agency may seek to monitor the overall quality of a large set of natural resources in order to choose regulatory policies that promote preservation sustainability and renewability . In addition to reading or studying such quality indicators for personal use individuals may also apply various data evaluation techniques to such natural resource indicators e.g. in order to evaluate a large number of quality indicators and or to extrapolate other data or information that may be of use.

However various complexities and competing interests of tracking systems may obstruct an individual from receiving using and comparing the natural resource quality indicators of one or more natural resources. As a first example a tracking agency may only collect some natural resource indicators for local use and may not report such quality indicators to the general public. Alternatively the natural resource indicators may be exposed to the public through inefficient communication channels e.g. as a printed text that is available on a limited basis at a particular location such as a library . As a second example a tracking agency may report quality indicators in a format that is difficult for an individual to use such as in a proprietary or overly technical format that the individual may not understand or a natural language narrative that the individual may have difficulty evaluating through automated techniques. As a third example a tracking agency may report quality indicators for multiple natural resources and or at various time points along a time continuum but the types of quality indicators reported by a tracking agency between natural resources and or time points may vary e.g. in format detail such as the reporting period or breakdown of quality indicators into components and type of reported information such that comparisons of the quality indicators between natural resources and or time points may be undependable or difficult. As a fourth example different tracking agencies may report quality indicators for different natural resources or different types of natural resources in different ways thereby obstructing a comparison of such natural resource quality indicators for different natural resources. Such difficulties may be intentional e.g. a state or industry with a poor track record for pollution control may seek to discourage comparisons of utilized natural resources with those of states or industries with good track records for pollution control or unintentional e.g. an unintended incompatibility in formats of data comprising quality indicators that are reported by different tracking agencies . As a fifth example even if natural resource quality indicators for different natural resources are publicly available in a compatible format such natural resource quality indicators may be available from a wide range of different providers and an individual seeking to perform a broad survey of natural resources may have difficulty discovering interfacing with and receiving quality indicators from a large set of providers of natural resource quality indicators. As a sixth example natural resource quality indicators may not be timely collected e.g. in realtime or reported and or may not be available online. For example an agency may periodically collect water quality samples for a particular body of water but might only be report such water quality samples as an annual printed bulletin. As a seventh example natural resources may be positioned at some locations and quality indicators are to be tracked and computed as per individual position and other factors.

The present disclosure relates to techniques for improving the reporting of quality indicators of natural resources to users. These techniques relate to the characterization of the different systems involved in the collection evaluation and reporting of data into two groups a set of natural resource quality sensors that are configured to collect and transmit natural resource quality indicators from one or more natural resources and a set of natural resource servers that are configured to receive natural resource quality indicators from one or more natural resource quality sensors to store such quality indicators and to generate reports of natural resource quality of various natural resources to users upon request. Additionally a natural resource server may utilize such natural resource quality indicators to track the criteria of one or more alerts and if the quality indicators satisfy the alert criteria for an alert may notify various users of the quality indicators e.g. notifying individuals located in a particular area when pollution levels for a local body of water exceed a tolerable threshold . In this manner the users may receive from one natural resource server a set of natural resource quality indicators possibly of a standardized format indicating the quality of various natural resources may evaluate and compare such quality indicators possibly utilizing automated processes that extrapolate further data and may use the information represented by the quality indicators to make decisions of a personal academic industrial financial trading and or governmental nature.

Still another embodiment involves a computer readable medium comprising processor executable instructions configured to apply the techniques presented herein. An exemplary computer readable medium that may be devised in these ways is illustrated in wherein the implementation comprises a computer readable medium e.g. a CD R DVD R or a platter of a hard disk drive on which is encoded computer readable data . This computer readable data in turn comprises a set of computer instructions configured to operate according to the principles set forth herein. In one such embodiment the processor executable instructions may be configured to perform a method of presenting to users natural resource quality indicators of respective natural resources such as the exemplary method of . In another such embodiment the processor executable instructions may be configured to implement a system for presenting to users natural resource quality indicators of respective natural resources such as the exemplary system of . Some embodiments of this computer readable medium may comprise a nontransitory computer readable storage medium e.g. a hard disk drive an optical disc or a flash memory device that is configured to store processor executable instructions configured in this manner. Many such computer readable media may be devised by those of ordinary skill in the art that are configured to operate in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

The techniques discussed herein may be devised with variations in many aspects and some variations may present additional advantages and or reduce disadvantages with respect to other variations of these and other techniques. Moreover some variations may be implemented in combination and some combinations may feature additional advantages and or reduced disadvantages through synergistic cooperation. The variations may be incorporated in various embodiments e.g. the exemplary method of and the exemplary system of to confer individual and or synergistic advantages upon such embodiments.

A first aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the scenarios wherein such techniques may be utilized. As a first example the techniques may be utilized to track and report quality indicators for many types of natural resources . These natural resources may include e.g. volumes of water such as in a water supply system or an ocean river lake stream or pond a volume of air such as the air within a defined region of a city a volume of soil or rock a mineral deposit or various types of animals or plants. These natural resources may exist in an unmanaged state in the environment such as in a naturally forming body of water in a managed state in the environment such as in a manmade lake or in a controlled facility such as a water tower or water distribution system. As a second example the techniques may be utilized to track many types of natural resource quality indicators of a natural resource . For instance natural resource quality indicators may be selected to indicate various natural properties of the natural resource such as a natural resource type indicator indicating a type of the natural resource within a class of natural resource types a natural resource age indicator indicating the age of the natural resource or a natural resource source indicator indicating the origin of the natural resource . The natural resource quality indicators may also be selected to indicate various chemical properties of the natural resource such as a natural resource component indicator indicating one or more components of the natural resource such as chemicals contained within a chemical natural resource or individual entities within a biological natural resource e.g. individual plants and animals within a wildlife preserve a natural resource concentration indicator indicating the concentration of particular chemical components of the natural resource or a natural resource contaminant indicator indicating the presence types and or amounts of various contaminants of the chemical concentration of the natural resource . The natural resource quality indicators may also be selected to indicate various physical properties of the natural resource such as a natural resource physical dimension indicator indicating one or more physical dimensions of the natural resource such as length width height mass density pressure distribution or shape a natural resource temperature indicator indicating a current temperature of the natural resource or a natural resource quantity indicator indicating a quantity of the natural resource . The natural resource quality indicators may also be selected to indicate various abstract properties of the natural resource such as a natural resource price indicator indicating a unit price of a unit of the natural resource that may be available for sale to users a natural resource consumer indicator indicating a consumer opinion of the natural resource and a natural resource quality grade indicator indicating a qualitative assessment of the properties of the natural resource .

In the particular example of a body of water natural resource quality indicators may be selected from a set of water quality indicators including a water chemical component indicator a water biological component indicator indicating the presence of microscopic or macroscopic organisms in the quantity of water a water physical component indicator indicating a physical property of the quantity of water such as pressure or state of matter a water purity indicator or a water contaminant indicator a water source indicator indicating the source of the water in the body of water a water temperature indicator indicating the temperature of the body of water a water volume indicator indicating a volumetric dimension of the body of water a water flow rate indicator and or a water flow direction indicator indicating a rate and or direction of flow of the water within another body of water over land or in a piping or irrigation system and or a water quality grade indicator indicating the quality and suitability of the water for various uses such as cooking drinking hygiene swimming cleaning fishing irrigation and use in an industrial process . A collection of such water quality indicators may be selected to describe the body of water in significant detail and a set of natural resource quality sensors may be selected and configured to detect such properties of the body of water for reporting to a natural resource server .

As a third example of this first aspect in some scenarios the natural resource may be managed by a natural resource processing system such as a water treatment or distribution facility a dam or reservoir control system a river flow monitoring system an air cleaning or conditioning system a soil or mineral deposit monitoring system or a wildlife location or health tracking system. In such scenarios various properties of one or more processing components of the natural resource processing system may be detected by various natural resource quality sensors and may be reported as natural resource quality indicators relating to the managed natural resource . For example a water treatment plant may include many processing components that measure properties of a body of water filter out large and small contaminants add desired minerals such as fluoride and distribute the water to various users and other systems and the natural resource quality indicators may be selected to indicate the existence configuration and operating status of these processing components e.g. the types and quantities of materials filtered out by a filtering system the types and quantities of minerals being added and a map of the distribution channels to various parts of a city with distribution flow rates and or flow directions . These qualities of the natural resource processing system may be as informative and useful to users as quality indicators of the natural resource proper and may therefore be reported together with such other natural resource quality indicators . Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many types of natural resource quality indicators that may be selected detected by various natural resource quality sensors and reported to users through a natural resource server according to the techniques presented herein.

A second aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the types and configurations of natural resource quality sensors utilized in the embodiment. As a first example the resource quality sensors may be fixed in a particular location with regard to a stationary natural resource e.g. a water sensor mounted in a wall of a reservoir containing a standing body of water fixed in a particular location where a mobile natural resource may be detected e.g. a water sensor mounted in a bank of a river to detect water surges transient e.g. a water sensor mounted in a floating buoy or a wildlife sensor fixed to a mobile animal or mobile e.g. a robot positioned within a nature preserve and controlled either autonomously or by a human operator to move to and monitor different locations within the nature preserve such as to track moving wildlife .

As a second example of this second aspect the natural resource quality sensors may be operated centrally e.g. may be wholly controlled by computers in a processing system or may be distributed e.g. with a degree of autonomous operation. In some scenarios the natural resource quality sensors may include sensors in a supervisory control and data acquisition SCADA system such as a distributed industrial control process comprising a set of remotely deployed sensors that detect and control various properties of an expansive natural resource or natural resource processing system and report the natural resource quality indicators to a centralized monitoring station. In some such scenarios SCADA systems may already deploy and utilize such sensors and the data generated thereby may be included or transformed for inclusion in the reporting systems discussed in the present disclosure. Alternatively or additionally the natural resource quality sensors may comprise standalone sensors that feature only sensing capabilities or may include one or more control elements that actively or passively affect the natural resource . As still another variation multiple natural resource quality sensors may be configured to detect and report natural resource quality indicators of a natural resource redundantly e.g. in case a natural resource quality sensor fails or exhibits inaccuracies in the detection or reporting of natural resource quality indicators .

As a third example of this second aspect a natural resource quality sensor may be configured to detect and report natural resource quality indicators of the natural resource autonomously e.g. at a particular period such as once per day or upon detecting various conditions of the natural resource such as a river flow sensor configured to detect and report surges in the flow rate of the river and or may be configured to report natural resource quality indicators upon request of other systems natural resource servers and or users e.g. a sensor may accept a request to detect a particular natural resource quality indicator type and upon receiving such a request may detect and report to a natural resource server the requested types of natural resource quality indicators for the natural resource . Additionally natural resource quality sensors may include mechanisms for reporting the location of the detected natural resource quality indicators e.g. the location of the natural resource quality sensor and or the natural resource at the time of collecting the natural resource quality indicator such as a Global Positioning System GPS receiver or a beacon triangulation system. Such natural resource quality sensors may therefore include with one or more natural resource quality indicators a geocode such as a latitude longitude pair that indicates the location where the natural resource quality indicator was collected.

As a fourth example of this second aspect natural resource quality sensors may comprise collections of various types of components that promote the functionality of the sensor. As a first variation a natural resource quality sensor may be powered by a battery a power receiving system connected to an energy source or a power generation component such as a solar panel wind turbine or water wheel. As a second variation the natural resource quality sensor may include various types of sensing components such as thermometers barometers manometers mass scales chemical or biological measuring components and cameras that feed images to various image processing algorithms that are configured to quantify various natural resource quality indicators visualized by the cameras. As a third variation the natural resource quality sensor may promptly report the natural resource quality indicators to a natural resource server upon detection may temporarily store such natural resource quality indicators in a buffer or may store such natural resource quality indicators in a volatile or non volatile memory for transmission to a natural resource server in a batch. As a fourth variation a natural resource quality sensor may include various components for transmitting natural resource quality indicators to a natural resource server via various communication channels such as a wide area computer network e.g. the internet or a radio or cellular communication network channel a local area computer network channel e.g. a WiFi network connecting a set of devices or a personal area network channel e.g. a Bluetooth network a radiofrequency identification device RFID network or an infrared communication channel . Those of ordinary skill in the art may select among many designs and components for inclusion in the natural resource quality sensors included in embodiments of the techniques presented herein.

A third aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the configuration and features of the natural resource server . As a first example an embodiment of these techniques may feature a single natural resource server a set of natural resource servers exposed as a single access point and operating in a cooperative manner e.g. a server farm a set of loosely coupled natural resource servers that provide independent access points to the natural resource quality indicators but that interoperate e.g. a set of globally interconnected distributed servers that share data or a set of independently operating natural resource servers e.g. a set of natural resource servers that independently receive and store natural resource quality indicators and generate reports at the request of users . A set of natural resource servers may also be organized as peers e.g. with each server having an equivalent set of capabilities to other servers and configured to request and receive data from other servers in a similar manner or as a hierarchy e.g. some natural resource servers having a superior relationship with one or more subordinate natural resource servers e.g. a canonical natural resource server that serves as an authoritative source of natural resource quality indicators and a mirror natural resource server that provides auxiliary access to the same information . Alternatively or additionally multiple natural resource servers may be configured to receive natural resource quality indicators and generate reports redundantly e.g. if a natural resource server fails or becomes unavailable other natural resource servers may be available to provide access to the same natural resource quality indicators for the same natural resources . As a second variation of this first example a natural resource server may be assigned to receive natural resource quality indicators from a particular set of one or more natural resource quality sensors or to receive natural resource quality indicators from any natural resource quality sensor included in an embodiment of these techniques.

As a second example of this third aspect the natural resource servers included in an embodiment of these techniques may include various components that provide various features. In a first such variation an embodiment of a natural resource server may comprise a hardware device such as a dedicated server that is configured for exclusive service as a natural resource server. Alternatively the natural resource server may be implemented as a software architecture such as a set of instructions comprising one or more software components that when stored in a memory of the device and executed on a processor of the device interoperate to cause the device to operate as a natural resource server . In a second such variation the natural resource server may communicate with natural resource quality sensors and or users via various communication channels such as a wide area network e.g. the internet or a radio or cellular communication network channel a local area network channel e.g. a WiFi network connecting a set of devices or a personal area network channel e.g. a Bluetooth network a radiofrequency identification device RFID network or an infrared communication channel . In a third such variation the natural resource server may store received natural resource quality indicators in various memory components such as system memory a hard disk drive a solid state storage device or a magnetic or optical disc. In a fourth such variation the natural resource quality indicators may be stored in many ways e.g. as records in a database as files in a file system or as objects in an object system.

As a third example of this third aspect one or more natural resource servers may be configured to communicate with one or more natural resource quality sensors in various ways. As a first variation of this third example natural resource server may also be configured to in addition to receiving natural resource quality indicators from a natural resource quality sensor send commands to the natural resource quality sensor relating to the capabilities thereof. For example a sensor in a SCADA system comprising a water treatment facility may send water quality indicators to a centralized monitoring server and in reply the server may send commands to the water quality sensor to adjust various properties of the components of the water treatment facility such as flow control systems or chemical treatment components. Alternatively or additionally a natural resource server may be configured to accept natural resource quality indicators only after authenticating the natural resource quality sensor wherefrom such indicators are transmitted. For example a natural resource server may be configured to store at least one sensor authentication credential associated with at least one natural resource quality sensor e.g. a cryptographic public key corresponding to a cryptographic private key stored by the natural resource quality sensor and used to sign natural resource quality indicators generated therefrom and the natural resource quality sensor may be configured to transmit the natural resource quality indicator to the natural resource server with at least one submitted sensor authentication credential e.g. a cryptographic signature of the natural resource quality indicator . Accordingly the natural resource server may be configured to upon receiving a natural resource quality indicator verify the submitted sensor authentication credential using the sensor authentication credential associated with the natural resource quality sensor and store the natural resource quality indicator only after verifying the submitted sensor authentication credential. This variation may reduce the reporting of natural resource quality indicators by untrusted sensors or malicious users as well as the forging of natural resource quality indicators to appear to issue from a trusted natural resource quality sensor or trusted operator thereof. As a second variation of this third example one or more natural resource quality sensors may be configured to report encrypted natural resource quality indicators to the natural resource server e.g. encrypted using a cryptographic public key of the natural resource server and the natural resource server may be configured to upon receiving an encrypted natural resource quality indicator decrypt the encrypted natural resource quality indicator e.g. using a corresponding cryptographic private key of the natural resource server . This variation may be advantageous e.g. for reducing by malicious users the incidence of eavesdropping or alteration of the natural resource quality indicators submitted by a trusted natural resource quality sensor .

As a third variation of this third example the natural resource server may comprise authentication credentials that are provided to a natural resource quality sensor and that are verified by the natural resource quality sensor e.g. before sending a natural resource quality indicator thereto and or accepting a command therefrom. Alternatively or additionally the natural resource server may send encrypted commands to the natural resource quality sensors which may be configured to decrypt the encrypted commands before execution. These variations may be advantageous e.g. for reducing communication with a natural resource quality sensor from an untrusted server masquerading as a natural resource server e.g. in order to send malicious commands to the sensor.

As a fourth example of this third aspect a natural resource server may send natural resource quality reports to users in many different ways. As a first variation the natural resource server may await a report request generated by a user and upon receiving such a report request e.g. a uniform resource locator URL request sent to the natural resource server configured as a web server may generate the natural resource quality report and deliver it to the user . As a first alternative the natural resource quality report may be pregenerated e.g. for a particular period a particular natural resource or a particular user and stored and may be provided upon request of the user e.g. the receipt of a uniform resource identifier URI request specifying a particular period natural resource or user in a RESTful access model . As a second alternative a natural resource quality report may be sent to a user spontaneously e.g. as an alert of a condition of a natural resource that may be relevant to a user . Various users may be selected for notifications e.g. an identification of users proximately located with respect to a natural resource for which alerts have been created or may specifically request to be notified of various alerts perhaps being permitted to generate a custom alert based on user specified alert criteria. For example the natural resource server may be configured to store at least one alert comprising at least one alert criterion associated with at least one natural resource e.g. a conditional trigger that when detected raises the alert at least one user contact associated with at least one user e.g. an email address or a Simple Message Service SMS compatible mobile phone number . Upon detecting the at least one alert criterion of an alert the natural resource server may notify the user of the alert using the stored user contacts. As one such scenario the natural resource server may store the email addresses of a set of users identified a residents of an area who may utilize a body of water for drinking cooking and hygiene. Upon receiving natural resource quality indicators indicating a rising level of a biological or chemical contaminant a change in state e.g. a freezing of the body of water or a reduced availability e.g. low volume due to drought conditions the natural resource server may send an email messages to the users to notify them of the change in the condition of the water supply.

As a second variation of this fourth example of this third aspect the natural resource server may be configured to respond to a report request received from a user by authenticating the user . For example a natural resource server may be configured to store at least one user authentication credential associated with at least one user e.g. a username and password combination . Such authentication credentials may be stored e.g. as part of a user profile of the user that also includes various information about the user that may be utilized to generate a relevant natural resource quality report e.g. a location associated with the user or the interests of the user that may be helpful in identifying which natural resources to include in the report . When the natural resource server receives a report request from a user the natural resource server may solicit the user authentication credentials from the user e.g. by presenting a login web page and upon receiving such credentials may verify the submitted user authentication credentials with the user authentication credential stored for the user and may send the natural resource quality report to the user only after verifying the submitted user authentication credentials. In this manner the natural resource server may provide natural resource quality reports to a particular set of users and may tailor such reports for the details of the user . This authentication technique may also be useful e.g. for creating a sponsorship model to offset some of the infrastructure costs of the embodiment e.g. a user of the embodiment may be permitted to create a paid for user account and the natural resource server may restrict the provision of natural resource quality reports or the provision of alerts only to users having a paid for user account. Members of the public may be invited to create a paid for user account but may also be provided a more limited e.g. less detailed version of a natural resource quality report .

As a fifth example of this third aspect many types of content may be selected for inclusion in a natural resource quality report generated by a natural resource server . As a first variation the natural resource quality report may be formatted in various ways for various uses by humans and automated processes. Some natural resource quality report types that may be useful in some scenarios include a print ready document e.g. a Portable Document Format PDF file a media document such as a sound diagram or video a human readable message such as an email message or a Simple Messaging Service SMS message a human readable web page a map of a location comprising at least one natural resource an image representing at least one natural resource or a process readable data representation of at least one natural resource quality indicator such as an Extensible Markup Language XML document comprising a hierarchically structured data set that specifies the natural resource quality indicators in a declarative manner. The content may also include e.g. one or more advertisements by advertisers such as commercial entities selling units of a natural resource for a particular price and the advertising revenue from such advertisements may be used to offset the infrastructure costs of the natural resource servers and or the natural resource quality sensors .

As a second variation of this fifth example of this third aspect a natural resource server may store natural resource quality indicators for a large and possibly diverse set of natural resources and may select among such natural resources and natural resource quality indicators for inclusion in a natural resource quality report generated for a particular user in many ways. For example the natural resource server may include in the natural resource quality report for only one or more particular types of natural resources that are of interest to the user e.g. only bodies of water and or only one or more particular types of natural resource quality indicators e.g. only indicators relating to contaminants of a body of water . Alternatively or additionally the natural resource server may from among the set of natural resources represented by natural resource quality indicators stored by the natural resource server select those that are pertinent to the user . For example the natural resource server may receive with a report request a geocode that indicates the location associated with the user e.g. a latitude longitude combination or an address or zip code of the user which may be entered manually by the user e.g. by selecting the location on a map detected by a device of the user e.g. a Global Positioning System GPS receiver or inferred by the natural resource server e.g. by geolocating the user based on the internet protocol IP address at which the user is available . The natural resource server may then generate a natural resource quality report relating to the natural resources located near the location associated with the user according to the geocode. This type of natural resource quality report may be represented e.g. as a graphical map indicating the detected location associated with the user and using text color coding descriptive icon etc. the presence availability and quality of various natural resources located near the user or in an area selected by the user as an area of interest.

As a third variation of this fifth example of this third aspect the natural resource server may include in the natural resource quality report various representations of time. In one such variation the natural resource server may indicate the age of the natural resource quality report and or the amount of time involved in generating the natural resource quality report by detecting a report time indicator relating to a report generation time compared with a report request time of the report request of the user . This variation may be advantageous e.g. if natural resource quality reports are pregenerated or if the generation thereof may be lengthy such that the age of the report may be relevant in assessing the freshness and reliability of the natural resource quality indicators reported therein. In a second such variation the ages of the natural resource quality indicators may be included in the natural resource quality report . For example at least one natural resource quality indicator may comprise a natural resource quality indicator time such as the date and time of capturing the natural resource quality indicator and the natural resource server may be configured to detect a natural resource quality indicator age relating to a report generation time compared with the natural resource quality indicator time e.g. this quality indicator was collected six days before the date of this report . This information may be advantageous e.g. for assessing the freshness of the natural resource quality indicators included in the natural resource quality report particularly where such indicators are not promptly collected and or represent ephemeral or volatile properties of the natural resource . Alternatively or additionally one or more natural resource quality sensors may be configured to detect a location of the natural resource e.g. using a global positioning service GPS receiver and to include in the natural resource quality indicator a geocode indicating the location of the natural resource and or the natural resource quality sensor at the time of detecting the natural resource quality indicator . Additionally a natural resource server may be configured to store the geocode associated with the natural resource quality indicator . This metadata concerning the natural resource quality indicator may be useful e.g. in generating a report of natural resources located near a user .

As a sixth example of this third aspect one or more natural resource servers may be configured to accept evaluate and apply one or more automated software processes configured to operate on the natural resource quality indicators associated with various natural resources . In accordance with various software agent and or mobile code techniques a user may devise a software process a agent that may perform various types of evaluation of a set of natural resource quality indicators and the user may provide the software process to a natural resource server for execution. As a first such example a complex statistical evaluation of a large set of natural resource quality indicators may be devised as a software process configured to execute on a natural resource server and generate output that may be stored on the natural resource server . As a second such example a agent may be configured to accept detected natural resource quality indicators from a first natural resource server and to reported one or more reported natural resource quality indicators based on the detected natural resource quality indicators e.g. data or conclusions derived from the detected natural resource quality indicators to a second natural resource server . As a third such example a agent may comprise a natural resource quality indicator database of natural resource quality indicators collected from one or more natural resource servers e.g. historic natural resource quality indicators reported by a natural resource server over time and may perform comparisons involving the collected set of natural resource quality indicators of a natural resource e.g. comparisons of currently detected natural resource quality indicators with historic natural resource quality indicators to generate one or more natural resource quality change indicators that may illustrate trends in the quality of the natural resource over time . Such comparisons may result in the delivery of data to a natural resource server for reporting and or to the user who devised the agent.
