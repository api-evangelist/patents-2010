The details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features will be apparent from the description and drawings and from the claims.

In certain systems or in certain environments information contained in or represented by some content items may be best understood and or used in combination with information contained in or represented by other content items. For example in an educational environment student performance instructor effectiveness or other assessment information contained in or represented by assessment data may be best understood in combination with explanatory content that describes or summarizes the assessment data. The description or summary can be specific such as where the explanatory content is statistical information representing a comparison of the assessment data with other assessment data such as assessment data for other students and or other times or the description or summary can be generic such as where the explanatory content describes generally the significance of different aspects of the assessment data. In addition or alternatively it may be useful to have easy access to content items related to the assessment data such as content items that describe the subject matter of the assessment lesson plans for instruction of the subject matter of the assessment or educational material for the instructor regarding the subject matter.

For example with reference to an instructor can access display that includes a first area that shows summary indications of student performance reflected by assessment data for a 7grade math assessment. Specifically average performance levels for a class of students are displayed in each of five standard skill areas and a breakdown of the number of students in the class whose assessment data indicates one of three levels of proficiency in each of the five standard skill areas are displayed. The instructor can review the performance indications to learn about the students performance and compare the class performance to a comparative metric such as school wide average performance levels. In order to assist the instructor to generally learn more about the 7grade math assessment a link to a document including an explanation of the five standard skill areas is available. By following the link the instructor can learn about the skills that are tested in each of the five standard skill areas. In order to help the particular students in the class improve their assessment scores and better understand the tested math skills the instructor can follow a link to a set of lesson plans that reflect the best practices of the school. Additionally the instructor can follow the link to access continuing education materials designed to improve the instructor s effectiveness in teaching the tested skills to the students of the class. Each of the links is formed as an icon indicating the type and or format of the related content item and includes a brief description of the related content item.

Some content items such as generic summary or explanatory content items may be recognized as related to other content items such as the content item which is summarized or explained. For example a book review can be identified as being related to the book which is reviewed. In some environments when accessing a content item users may wish to automatically receive links to other related content items such as in the display . In some implementations a preview of the related content item or even a display of the entire content item may be provided as is illustrated in area of display of .

In some instances related content items may be spread across institutions that do not directly share access to their respective content items and different educational institutions may employ different tests or assessment standards for assessing skills which may create difficulties in identifying the pieces of related content items as such. With reference to system includes a related content service system and client systems that include content items in various formats such as web pages word processing documents videos and graphic files among others. The related content service system can communicate with the client systems over a network such as the Internet. The client systems are educational computer systems of various schools school districts state education agencies and or subsystems thereof and the related content service system can access and distribute content items among the client systems over the network . In other words in some implementations at least some of the client systems are part of different schools or school districts that typically use separate systems but the related content server system connects the various schools or districts so that various documents which are typically only available to a given school system can be made available to other connected school systems.

The related content service system can search for content items across the client systems that are related to educational assessment information being displayed to a user. For example in some implementations the related content service system includes a crawler an index a content repository a user interface module a query service module a query processor and a user interface service module .

The crawler is operable to access the content repository to retrieve documents and metadata regarding the documents and to access the data repository to retrieve instructor effectiveness and student achievement metrics. The crawler applies categorization and ranking algorithms on this data and stores the results in the index . The crawler also stores a canonical representation of the content items in the content repository for use in distributing the content items to others of the client systems including through read only or view only access or through delivery of restricted or unrestricted copies of the related content items.

The query processor implements a faceted search engine that processes search queries against the index and performs ranking and or filtering of the results which may be based on additional datasets not stored as part of the index such as social networking information. The query service module provides a mechanism through which an application submits queries for processing by the query processor . The query service module is for example a REST or SOAP web service.

The user interface UI module provides a UI allowing content to be read from the content repository and displayed to users who may not have the same content management system. The UI module uses a canonical representation of the document and respects access control and sharing rules set by the content owners. The UI includes controls that allow ratings and usage feedback to be captured added to the index and if applicable added to the content repository or other source content management system. The UI service module provides APIs for applications to access to the UI module .

One or more of the client systems such as client system are configured to provide selected services to users of the client system. For example client system provides an instructor or an administrator access to various data such as assessment and or effectiveness data for one or more students and or one or more instructors as well as provides access to other content items such as lesson plans recommended activities or best practices information among others. To enable these or other features the client system includes a user interface a data module e.g. a business intelligence tool a data repository a content module e.g. a content management tool and a content repository .

The content repository contains documents such as multimedia files including audio video and graphic files text files including articles and lesson plans and or html files including files for Internet web pages including multimedia material articles lesson plans or other materials. The data repository stores instructor effectiveness data and student assessment data. The content module provides access to the content items in the content repository . The data module provides reports and other analysis of the instructor effectiveness data and the student assessment data.

The user interface component integrates with the content module and or data module and interacts with the related content service system to provide a display of content items related to the content displayed using the content module and or data module . For instance the user interface may employ the data module to display a student or class assessment report and then extract context information from the data presented to the user pass this context information to the query service module which would form a query and employ the query processor to conduct the query against the index . The query service module returns the results of the search to the user interface which then communicates with UI service module to display the results of the search and enable access to the related content items returned as results of the search.

One or more of the components of the related content service system and or the client systems can be implemented in one or more computer systems such as the computer system of discussed in greater detail below.

In one example the crawler may access the content repository in response to a request for crawling or in response to the addition of one or more new pieces of content to the content repository . The request may be generated by the content module automatically based on a user s use of the content module to create access and or modify one or more content items in the content repository . Alternatively the crawler may access the content repository periodically to determine whether any content item has been added to the content repository . When a new content item is identified including when a content item is modified or updated the crawler reads the content item in its native format and determines appropriate educational related topics categories or patterns more generally contexts that are related to the content item. The topics categories or patterns may not be content specific but instead are general across the system . For example the crawler may determine that the information of a content item in a specific format relates to a pattern of information such as 2grade wall which refers to a phenomenon in which students in grades through demonstrate fluency in a decoding skill and a deficiency in a reading comprehension skill. Based on this determination the crawler indexes the content item in the index as related to the pattern 2grade wall. 

In some implementations the crawler can make determinations based on explicit context identification implicit context identification and or combinations thereof. In identifying the contexts of content items the crawler can analyze the data text metadata tags ratings and or usage information of the content items. For example an author of a content item may tag the content item as being related to one or more topics categories patterns or other contexts and the crawler can identify the tags and index the content item as related to the contexts identified by the tag information. Additionally the text of the content item can be analyzed to determine commonly recurring keywords and or keywords occurring in prominent locations such as in the title or headings. Based on the keywords the crawler can determine related contexts for the content item. The contexts of the content items can include categories for different performance levels such as proficient or at risk . Different skills or topics of knowledge can also be reflected by different topics such as math reading comprehension or blending skill. The contexts of the content items can also include categories for different student characteristics such as 2grade or English language learning. Similarly different instructor or school characteristics can be associated with respective contexts of the content items.

The crawler can also rank the content item with respect to each related index context and store an indication of the rank of the content item for each related index context. For example the content item discussed above relating to teaching math to English language learning students authored by the first educator can be ranked by the crawler relative to other content items that relate to the same contexts or the same combination of contexts such as using a ranking score based on a scale of 0 to 100 or a number of stars out of five. In one example the crawler can rank the content items based on a measure of strength of relatedness to the topic. For example a content item that uses a particular keyword frequently and in prominent locations may be ranked higher for a context related to the keyword than another content item that uses the keyword less frequently or less prominently although both items may be indexed as being related to the context. Optionally the crawler can also access the data repository to obtain effectiveness data relating to the author of the content item. The crawler can then rank the content items based on a measure of effectiveness of the author in achieving desired results such as high assessment scores in teaching math to English language learning students.

The user interface module is operable to allow access to the related content service system to a user such as through the user interface of the client system . Thus the user interface module receives information including requests for related content items from the client system and provides indications of selected related content items for display to the user. The user interface module can also receive requests for selected ones the indicated related content items. For example an instructor can view student assessment data and or instructor effectiveness data stored in the data repository that is associated with one or more students and or instructors. The user interface may provide a display such as display of which includes a first area for displaying indications based on the assessment data. The assessment data indications can include the assessment data itself or derivations of the assessment data such as analysis information generated based on the assessment data. The user interface may access the data repository by interaction with the data module which retrieves formats analyzes and transmits requested or selected data to the user interface for display in the first area .

The display also includes a second area for related content items. To display the related content items a context of the indications shown in the first area of the display is determined and is used to identify content items that are related to the context of the indications . For example the user interface or user interface module can determine the context of the information shown in first area or the underlying data for example student assessment data used to generate the display in the first area. Once the context of the indications and or the context of the data upon which the indications are based have been determined the user interface passes the determined context to the query service module along with a request for related content. In response the query service module generates an index query based on the determined context. In another example the user interface transmits a request for related content without first determining the context of the indications . In this case the request includes the indications and or the assessment data on which the indications are based. After receiving the request for related content the query service module determines the context of the indications or the assessment data and generates an index query based on the determined context.

In some implementations the user interface or user interface module may be designed to analyze assessment data in different formats to determine the context of the information shown which may then be used for the query. Doing so may allow the system to operate across multiple different school districts or systems at least some of which store or generate assessment data in different formats. In other words the system may not only crawl and index documents in different formats across differently managed school systems the system may also be designed so that the appropriate queries can be formulated based on assessment data in different formats which may vary across the different school systems.

For example one school district may employ a DIBELS and therefore store assessment data in a DIBELS format while another school district may employ DRA and therefore store data in a DRA format. In some implementations the user interface or user interface module is designed to analyze the different formats and look for signatures in the different formats that correspond to a particular context. For instance the user interface or user interface module may be designed to analyze DIBELS assessment data and determine a first signature in that data that corresponds to the 2grade wall context discussed above and also be designed to analyze DRA assessment data to determine a second signature in that data that also corresponds to the 2nd grade wall context. Thus in such a scenario the user interface or user interface module can operate in both environments to determine the same or similar query to obtain the same or similar content related to the context.

The index query is configured to request content related to the generic contexts of the index that relate to the determined context based on analysis of the assessment data and or information about the data. For example the assessment data may be assessment data for a particular student in a particular format. The data may provide evidence of certain patterns of information including patterns of skill levels and or trends of skill levels and the data information and or patterns of data and information can be used to determine the context of the indications . The query module generates an index query using this determined context such as a query that requests content related to the pattern of 5grade students who are advanced in math and proficient in English since this pattern is indicated by the indications as shown in the first area of the display . The query module can generated the index query even where the data merely provides the raw assessment scores for math and English and the query module makes the determination that the raw scores in the particular format indicate the specific categories and values of performance evidenced by the assessment scores i.e. advanced for math and proficient for English . Additionally or alternatively the query module can generate the index query such that content items related to individual topics are identified instead of information related to a pattern. For example the query module can generate an index query that relates to improving reading comprehension since the data displayed in area indicates that the student s worst score is in reading comprehension or because the student obtained an assessment score in reading comprehension that is below a proficient level.

As a further example the query module can generate a query based on as illustrated in an area of a display shown in data that indicates a progression or trend over time in math assessment scores for an individual student a class a grade or a school. Based on the progression or trend the query module can generate an index query that relates to the particular assessment score levels the general progression or trend or patterns of information such as the score levels and the rate of change of the scores.

Additional information can also be used to identify patterns such as demographic information of the school instructor and or students that are associated with the scores. For example the data illustrates a general upward trend and also illustrates a sharp initial improvement and a subsequent plateau. Either or both of these progressions or trends can be used in pattern identification.

A related content item returned from the query processor is displayed in area . The related content is an article authored by another user of the system such as an individual from a different community or organization and includes interpretive information regarding the significance of the data and or the progressions or trends exhibited by the data . The related content also includes prescriptive information regarding a recommended course of action that can be employed effectively to achieve a desired result for one or more students exhibiting the progressions or trends indicated by the data . In some implementations the related content displayed in the area is the most relevant and or the highest ranked content that is related to the context of the data . Additional or different content can be accessed using a control of the display such as a link a button or another control element.

The query processor receives the index query from the query module and performs a query against the index to ascertain relevant content items based on the index query and optionally based on the rankings. If desired the query processor can return an indication of each of the retrieved related content items. The user interface then uses this information to access UI service module to generate for example the second area that includes indications and identifying the related content items or the similar areas shown in . The indications and can also serve as tools for accessing the content items such as an executable link that when activated requests access to an associated related content item. In some implementations the indications and are text titles or summary descriptions of the related content items. However icons or other graphical representations and or selected portions of the related content items such as quotations can be used as at least part of the indications and . Referring again to the example above in response to the index query the query processor may retrieve a text document reflecting the best practices of another instructor and a video demonstration of a class lesson designed to improve reading comprehension skills for 5grade students. The indication includes a representative portion of the text document for review by the instructor and the indication includes a text description and a link for accessing the related video. When activated the link causes the video to be displayed to the instructor such as in a new window of the user interface .

In addition to the indications and of related content displayed in area the display includes information regarding the author of a selected content item that is associated with one or both of the indications and . The information regarding the author is displayed in an area of the display and can include information such as comments from other users on the indicated comment and or the author generally. For example an indication that the author is ranked highly among their peers for teaching performance can be displayed. The ranking can be based on analysis of assessment data of the instructor s 5grade students in the area of reading comprehension since this is the relevant topic. Alternatively the ranking can be based generally on the instructor s performance data. In some implementations the information regarding the author of the related content item can be used as a filter either when selecting the related content or when displaying the indications and of the related content. For example only related content items that are authored by an individual who is included in a list of known users or a user s social network may be selected. In another example a related content item may be ranked higher than it would otherwise be ranked based on the author s inclusion in the network. The information about a user s social network may be provided by a social network component .

The social network module is operable to create and modify a portion of a user account or profile that defines a social network of other users. In some implementations the network module may automatically create a network of other users by adding all other users of the same client system to the network of the other users although other criteria for automatic inclusion and or exclusion from the network can be used. Additionally the user can control the inclusion or exclusion of other users from their network by issuing commands to the network module through the user interface for example. A navigational link may be included to access a display for controlling the network module. The query service module may access the social network module to obtain information about a user s social network when ranking or otherwise filtering the results of a query.

Other modules may include a micropayment module that manages disbursement of cash payments or other forms of payments to authors who contribute content. For example the micropayment module can identify which content items are rated highly by users as being helpful or relevant and can assign a credit in a determined amount to one or more associated authors or institutions based on the ratings. In addition to or instead of cash payments contributing authors can earn credits for materials services or the like for the school at which they work or for a school of their choosing.

Referring now to a computer system useable in the system includes a processor a memory module a storage device an input output device and a system bus . The processor is operable to execute instructions in the form of a computer program or application stored in the memory module or stored on the storage device . Additionally information can be stored in a data structure in the memory module or on the storage device . The input output device is operable to transmit signals or data from the processor the memory module and or the storage device to an input output device and to receive signals or data from an input output device . An input output device can be a computer network communication device operable to communicate over the Internet such as a modem. Thus a computer implemented process can be carried out using one or more computer system by execution of computer executable instructions in the form of one or more computer software program.

For example as illustrated in a computer system such as a computer system of the related content service system may include instructions that enable the computer system to index remotely stored content items such as content items stored in the content repository of the client system among others . In some implementations indexing the content items includes accessing the remote content items and analyzing the remote content items to determine corresponding educational contexts for the remote content items. This can be performed for example by identifying tags supplied by an author of the remote content items and or by identifying keywords occurring within the remote content items as described above.

The remotely stored content items may be located in multiple systems that are managed by different school systems that normally do not share information amongst one another. In some implementations where the computer system indexes remote content items from sources that do not share information directly the computer system can serve as a hub in a network of federated sources of content items and allow users to access content items originating from outside of an organization or other entity with which they are associated such as from a different school system.

After determining educational contexts for the remote content items the computer system can update an index such as the index that associates the determined educational contexts with the corresponding remote content items. In particular the index can be updated by adding information regarding the determined educational contexts of the analyzed remote content items. The computer system can store a canonical representation of each of the indexed remote content items such as in the content repository .

In another example a computer system such as the computer system that performs the indexing and storing described above can include instructions that enable the computer system to provide a display of selected content items portions of selected content items or information relating selected content items to a user based on educational assessment data being displayed or requested. In some implementations the computer system is configured to cause a display of information reflecting performance of at least one student that is determined based on educational assessment data for the student . For instance a display such as display may be provided which includes the information reflecting performance of at least one student displayed at area . The educational assessment data for the student may be in a first one of multiple educational assessment data formats. For example the display can be provided to an instructor associated with a first school system that uses a first type of educational assessment that involves assessment data of a first format. The educational assessment data can include data about student performance for at least two tested skills.

The computer system then determines that the educational assessment data for the student is in a first one of the multiple educational assessment data formats . Based on the determination that the educational assessment data is in the first educational assessment data format the computer system determines a first set of context signatures specific to the first educational assessment data format from multiple sets of context signatures corresponding to the multiple educational assessment data formats . The context signatures in the first set of context signatures correspond to potential educational contexts of the information reflecting performance of the student. For example one of the context signatures in the first set can correspond to the 2grade wall context discussed above.

After determining the first set of context signatures the computer system analyzes the educational assessment data for the student based on the first set of context signatures to detect at least one of the context signatures . Based on the analysis of the educational assessment data the computer system detects at least one of the context signatures and identifies a set of content items related to the educational context corresponding to the detected context signature . For example if the information regarding student performance includes information regarding performance in decoding and reading comprehension for a 1 2 or 3grade student the computer system can determine that the information regarding student performance for the at least two tested skills corresponds to performance levels of the context signature for 2grade wall which relates to the two tested skills i.e. decoding and reading comprehension.

The computer system then causes the identified set of content items to be displayed with the information reflecting performance of the student . In some implementations the computer system ranks the identified content items and causes the identified content items to be displayed the in rank order. For example the content items can be ranked based on instructor effectiveness information associated with authors of one or more of the identified content items student performance information associated with authors of one or more of the identified content items and or social network information of a user associated with the display of the information reflecting performance of the student.

Additionally or alternatively the content items can be ranked based on student performance information associated individuals that accessed or otherwise viewed the content items. For example student performance information for students of an instructor that previously accessed a content item can be used to rank the content item for display to another instructor for instance an instructor other than the instructor of the students. For example an instructor of the students may assign the content to the students for a computer system that notes the students were instructed to and did access the content. This information may be used to track which students accessed the content and may be used together with student performance information that reflects the students performance with respect to skills related to the subject matter of the content. The student performance information can include progress information that compares student assessment information for the students before and after the content item was accessed by the student. In another example students may be able to access their own performance information and related content items can be presented to the students. Subsequent student performance information for the student including progress information can be used to rank the content item for display to another student or to another instructor.

When another user views different information reflecting performance of at least one other student that is determined based on educational assessment data for the other student the process described above with respect to elements can be repeated for the second information. Moreover the computer system is configured to perform these steps even when the educational assessment data for the other student is in a different format. Thus when the system causes a second display of information that reflects performance of a second student the system may determine that the educational assessment data for the second student is in a second one of the multiple educational assessment data formats and determine a second set of context signatures specific to the second educational assessment data format from the multiple sets of context signatures. The system then may analyze the second educational assessment data for the second student based on the second set of context signatures and detect at least one of the context signatures of the second set of context signatures. The context corresponding to the detected context signature then may be used to identify related content items and the system may cause the display of those content items with the information that reflects performance of the second student.

A number of implementations have been described. Nevertheless it will be understood that various modifications may be made. For example the foregoing disclosure can be applied to different environments. Thus content other than educational data and content can be managed to identify and provide access to related pieces of content from within the system. Similarly different indexing searching and or ranking techniques may be employed in performing the functions described above. Additionally the various functions can be performed by one or more different components or components can perform more functions than as described above. For example in some implementations the query module can request the crawler to generate the index query in a manner similar to that described above when analyzing pieces of content. Accordingly other implementations are within the scope of this disclosure.
