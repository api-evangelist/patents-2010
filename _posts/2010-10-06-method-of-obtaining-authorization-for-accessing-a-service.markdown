The mobile device may provide two principal modes of communication a data communication mode and an optional voice communication mode. In the data communication mode a received data signal such as a text message an email message or Web page download will be processed by the communication subsystem and input to the processor for further processing. For example a downloaded Web page may be further processed by a browser application or an email message may be processed by the email messaging application and output to the display . A user of the mobile device may also compose data items such as email messages for example using the input devices in conjunction with the display screen . These composed items may be transmitted through the communication subsystem over the wireless network .

In the voice communication mode the mobile device provides telephony functions and operates as a typical cellular phone. The overall operation is similar except that the received signals would be output to the speaker and signals for transmission would be generated by a transducer such as the microphone . The telephony functions are provided by a combination of software firmware i.e. the voice communication module and hardware i.e. the microphone the speaker and input devices . Alternative voice or audio I O subsystems such as a voice message recording subsystem may also be implemented on the mobile device . Although voice or audio signal output is typically accomplished primarily through the speaker the display screen may also be used to provide an indication of the identity of a calling party duration of a voice call or other voice call related information.

Reference is now made to which shows in flowchart form a method of obtaining authorization from an authorization server to access a service.

The method begins with receipt of a request to access a service in operation . The request is received by the authorization server from the service provider . This request is triggered by an attempt by a requestor to access a service provided by the service provider . In attempting access the requestor generally verifies his identity by entering his username and in some cases a password. In some embodiments upon verification of the requestor s identity a requestor request message is sent from the service provider to the authorization server indicating the requestor and the service to which access is being requested. In some embodiments the service provider and the authorization server are part of the same system so receipt of a requestor s request to access a service directly triggers the authorization module.

In some embodiments the requestor may have registered his credentials including his name and a mobile device in his possession with a service provider or authorization server . In these embodiments the requestor may request access to a service by entering only his username or unique identifier. In this approach the requestor s identity can be verified via an authorization request as discussed herein. The credentials registered with the service provider or authorization server may include a username or identifier and contact information for at least one mobile device associated with the username or identifier. The contact information may include an email address phone number SIP URI PIN number or other address information for contacting the mobile device.

Upon receipt of a requestor request to access a service the authorization server sends authorization requests to one or more mobile devices on an approval list . The approval list is stored on or generated from the user database and comprises a list of authorizers who may be queried to authorize access to the service. Each authorizer entry is associated with one or more mobile devices from which the authorizer s permission may be requested.

In some embodiments the approval list is specific to the requestor and the service and each requestor may have a different approval list. In some embodiments the approval list is independent from the requestor and is based on the service to which access is being requested. In some embodiments the requestor is included on the approval list and an authorization request is sent to his mobile device to verify his identity and or his request to access the service.

As described above authorization requests can be in the form of email voice instant or text messages. In some embodiments authorization messages may be in message formats specific to authorization modules installed on the authorization server and the mobile devices.

In some embodiments the authorization server can be configured to broadcast authorization requests to mobile devices associated with all the authorizers on the approval list. In some embodiments the authorization server can be configured to send authorization requests to a subset of the mobile devices associated with the authorizers on the approval list and subsequently to other associated mobile devices if an insufficient number of responses are received from the initial subset of mobile devices.

In step the authorization server receives authorization responses from the mobile devices in response to the authorization requests. These authorization responses can comprise only a positive or a negative response. In some embodiments an authorization response can further comprise information containing the authorizer s reasons for the positive or negative response.

The authorization responses are generated by a mobile device when an authorizer provides input in response to the authorization request. When the authorization request is first received by the mobile device via one of the aforementioned messaging systems the authorization module configures the processor to output an authorization request notification to the authorizer. This notification can be in the form of an audio signal such as a ring or chime a visual signal such as a flashing LED or a visual message or indicator displayed on the device display . The mobile device can be further configured to convey to the authorizer the identity of the requestor the service to which access is being requested and any other information in the authorization request. The mobile device can receive a user input from the authorizer to allow or deny the request. In some embodiments the authorizer can also input or select a reason for his decision. The mobile device then formats and sends an authorization response to the authorization server .

In some embodiments before an authorizer can provide a response to an authorization request he must verify his identity on the mobile device. This verification may be done by entering a secret such as a password associated with the service entering a password associated with the mobile device or providing biometric identification such as a fingerprint scan or voice recognition. In some embodiments a camera may be used to verify an authorizer using face recognition techniques or retinal scans.

Upon receipt of an authorization response the authorization server can be configured to determine whether a further authorization request is required . In accordance with an aspect of the present disclosure further authorization requests can be required when there is a hierarchy of authorizers. For example when a requestor requests access to a service he may need authorization from the vice president of his department however before the VP can authorize access the requestor s department manager may have to approve access. In this example the authorization server can be configured to send an authorization request to his manager who is on the first approval list. Upon receipt of a positive authorization response from the manager the authorization server can then send an additional authorization request to the VP or any other authorizers who are on a second approval list. The authorization server is also configured to receive additional authorization responses to these requests.

In another example when a requestor requests access to a service he may require authorization from his manager however the manager may wish to delegate his authority to an IT information technology administrator who may have better knowledge of potential security issues associated with the service. In this example the manager is included on the first approval list and his mobile device receives an authorization request. Upon receiving this request the manager provides input indicating that he is delegating his authority to the IT administrator. The authorization module on his mobile device includes a delegation request containing his choice of delegate with the authorization response. Upon receipt of the delegation request the authorization server can verify that the delegate has sufficient authority to authorize access to the service. Upon verification the authorization server sends an authorization request to a mobile device associated with the delegate and to receive a corresponding authorization response.

After receiving a number of authorization responses the authorization server is configured to determine whether a required level of authorization has been received before authorizing access to a service . For example a predetermined level of authorization may be received when a specific number or percentage of authorizers on the approval list have responded positively. In another example a predetermined level of authorization may be received when positive responses have been received from the requestor s mobile device as well as another authorizer on the approval list. In yet another example a predetermined level of authorization may be received when a predetermined number or percentage of authorizers on a first approval list and a predetermined number or percentage of authorizers on a second approval list have responded positively.

In another embodiment a predetermined level of authorization may not be denied if a maximum threshold of negative responses is reached first. For example if a predetermined number of positive responses have not been received the authorization server can be configured to deny access to the service when a predetermined number of negative responses are received regardless of the number of subsequently received positive responses.

In some embodiments the requestor may be denied access to the service if too much time has elapsed before a predetermined level of authorization is received.

In some embodiments the authorization server can be configured to broadcast to all mobile devices on the approval list a message indicating when access to the service has been granted or denied.

In another aspect of the present disclosure once a requestor has been granted access to a service the requestor s mobile device can be configured to provide information about the requestor to the service. For example if a requestor has requested access to a health care service and has been granted authorization by the authorizers on the associated approval list such as his doctor the requestor may need to provide additional information to the health care service such as his health card number or his medical history. Instead of verbally or manually providing this information to the health care service provider if this information is stored on the requestor s mobile device the required information can be transferred from the requestor s mobile device to the service provider.

In some embodiments once a requestor has been authorized to access a service the service or the authorization server may be configured to send an information request to a mobile device associated with the requestor. Upon receipt of the information request and if the requested information is available on the requestor s mobile device the information is sent from the mobile device to the service or authorization server in the form of an information response.

In some embodiments the mobile device is configured to prompt the requester to confirm what information if any to send to the service. If the information is not stored on the mobile device the mobile device can be configured to request the information from the requestor. In some embodiments the mobile device is configured to request verification of the requestor s identity such as by requesting a password before sending the information response.
