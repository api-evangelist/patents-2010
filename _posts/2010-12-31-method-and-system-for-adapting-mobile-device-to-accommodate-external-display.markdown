The present invention relates to mobile devices and more particularly to methods and systems allowing for outputting information or signals from and or inputting information or signals to mobile devices.

Mobile devices such as cell phones personal digital assistants PDAs and smart phones are ubiquitous and used for a variety of purposes. Although mobile devices provide many advantages to users the usage of mobile devices in some circumstances is constrained or less than ideal because of the mobile devices relatively small size.

Among other things the displays or screens incorporated on mobile devices typically are of relatively small cross section. Thus depending upon the circumstance such displays are often inadequate for clearly displaying large amounts of information. Also the dedicated keys or buttons on mobile devices often are relatively small in their physical size and as a result in some circumstances it can be awkward for users to push or otherwise manipulate these input devices to input commands or information into the mobile devices.

It would therefore be advantageous if an improved method or system for use or implementation on or in relation to mobile devices could be developed that allowed for mobile devices to overcome one or more shortcomings such as one or more of those mentioned above.

In at least one embodiment the present invention relates to a mobile device. The mobile device includes a first communication device having one or both of a first transmitter and a first receiver a user input device allowing the mobile device to receive user inputs a terminal by which the mobile device can be in communication with an external display device and at least one processor portion executing a plurality of software components including a mobile device operating system component and at least one intermediary software component by which the mobile device operating system communicates at least indirectly with both the user input device and the terminal. The plurality of software components operate so as to provide external display driving signals at the terminal that are configured to cause the external display device to display an image including a first image portion representative of an operational status or condition of the mobile device.

In at least one additional embodiment the present invention relates to a mobile device system that includes a mobile device and an external display device. The mobile device has a touchscreen display an operating system and at least one additional software component executed by at least one processing component the at least one additional software component serving to communicate to the operating system at least indirectly one or more input signals from the touchscreen display. The at least one additional software component generates output signals based upon one or more first image signals communicated at least indirectly from the operating system. The external display device of the mobile device system is in communication with the mobile device. The external display device receives the output signals and based thereon displays an image having first and second image components and the first image component is reflective of a mobile device status or operational condition and is substantially similar to another image that would have been displayed on the touchscreen display if the external display device was not in communication with the mobile device.

Further in at least one embodiment the present invention relates to a method of operating a mobile device in relation to an external display device. The method includes receiving one or more user inputs at a touchscreen display of the mobile device and providing at least indirectly one or more input signals indicative of the user inputs to a mobile device operating system by way of one or more additional intermediary software components. The method additionally includes generating at the mobile device operating system one or more first image signals indicative of a first image portion representative of a mobile device status or operational condition and processing the one or more first image signals so as to produce second image signals also indicative of the first image portion. The method further includes sending output signals identical to or based at least partly upon the second image signals for receipt by the external display device whereby the external display device displays an overall image including the first image portion.

Referring to an example mobile device is shown to be interconnected with an external display device . The interconnection in the present embodiment is a wired connection linking a terminal output terminal of the mobile device with the external display device . In alternate embodiments other forms of connections between the mobile device and the external display device can be implemented including wireless connections such as a Bluetooth connection. The mobile device is intended to be representative of a variety of mobile devices including for example cellular telephones personal digital assistants PDAs smart phones or other handheld or portable electronic devices. In alternate embodiments the mobile device can also be a headset MP3 player battery powered device wearable device radio navigation device laptop or notebook computer netbook pager PMP personal media player DVR digital video recorders gaming device camera e reader e book tablet device navigation device with video capable screen multimedia docking station or other mobile device.

The external display device can also take a variety of forms depending on the embodiment. For example the external display device can be a television a high definition television HDTV display a monitor or other display device e.g. a tablet device such as an e book including possibly a display device that is already associated with or implemented in other device. In the present embodiment it is envisioned that the external display device does not have significant processing capabilities and merely serves as a device for displaying images purely or substantially based upon signals generated by and received from the mobile device and communicated to the external display device via the wired connection . To the extent the external display device has any processing capabilities such capabilities are limited to adjusting standard image characteristics such as tint brightness contrast and black and white versus color display etc. However in other embodiments the external display device can instead be a smart device having more processing capabilities. For example the external display device can be a screen of a personal computer notebook computer or similar device having substantial processing capabilities.

As shown in the present embodiment the external display device particularly includes a display that is substantially larger in cross sectional area than a touchscreen display of the mobile device e.g. an area that is approximately 10 times larger . Nevertheless the relative sizes of the displays can vary considerably depending upon the embodiment. In addition to being able to output images the touchscreen display is also able to receive or sense touch type inputs as provided by way of a user s finger or other touch input device such as a stylus. Notwithstanding the presence of the touchscreen display in the present embodiment the mobile device also has a number of discrete keys or buttons that serve as input devices of the mobile device. However in other embodiments such keys or buttons or any particular number of such keys or buttons need not be present and rather the touchscreen display can serve as the primary or only user input device.

Referring to there is provided a block diagram illustrating example internal hardware components of the mobile device of in accordance with the present embodiment. As shown in the internal components include one or more wireless transceivers a processor portion e.g. one or more of microprocessor s microcomputer s application specific integrated circuit s etc. a memory portion one or more output devices and one or more input devices . The internal components can further include a component interface to provide a direct connection to auxiliary components or accessories for additional or enhanced functionality. The internal components preferably also include a power supply such as a battery for providing power to the other internal components while enabling the mobile device to be portable. Further the internal components additionally include one or more sensors . All of the internal components can be coupled to one another and in communication with one another by way of one or more internal communication links e.g. an internal bus .

Each of the wireless transceivers utilizes a wireless technology for communication which can include for example but are not limited to cellular based communication technologies such as analog communications using AMPS digital communications using CDMA TDMA GSM iDEN GPRS EDGE etc. and next generation communications using UMTS WCDMA LTE IEEE 802.16 etc. or variants thereof or peer to peer or ad hoc communication technologies such as HomeRF radio frequency Bluetooth or IEEE 802.11 a b g or n or other wireless communication technologies such as infrared technology. In the present embodiment the wireless transceivers include a cellular transceiver and a wireless local area network WLAN transceiver although in other embodiments only one of these types of wireless transceivers and possibly neither of these types of wireless transceivers and or additional types of wireless transceivers is present. It should be understood that while the present embodiment includes the wireless transceivers each of which can be understood to include both a wireless receiver and a wireless transmitter in other embodiments the receiver and transmitter for any given type of type of wireless technology can be distinct components and or a receiver for a given type of wireless technology can be present even though a transmitter for that wireless technology is not present or vice versa a transmitter is present while a receiver is not .

By virtue of the use of the wireless transceivers the mobile device is capable of communicating with a variety of external components such as cell towers access points hotspots and other devices. As already noted although the embodiment of shows the external display device as being coupled to the mobile device via the wired connection in other embodiments communications between the mobile device and the external display device can be accomplished by way of a wireless connection. In some such embodiments one or more of the wireless transceivers for example a Bluetooth transceiver can be used by the mobile device to achieve communications with the external display device . To the extent that such wireless communications are used for this purpose the wireless transceivers or the particular wireless transceiver of the mobile device used for such communications can be considered the terminal of the mobile device by which the mobile device is in communications with the external display device.

Operation of the wireless transceivers in conjunction with others of the internal components of the mobile device can take a variety of forms. For example operation of the wireless transceivers can proceed in a manner in which upon reception of wireless signals the internal components detect communication signals and the transceivers demodulate the communication signals to recover incoming information such as voice and or data transmitted by the wireless signals. After receiving the incoming information from the transceivers the processor portion formats the incoming information for the one or more output devices . Likewise for transmission of wireless signals the processor portion formats outgoing information which can but need not be activated by the input devices and conveys the outgoing information to one or more of the wireless transceivers for modulation so as to provide modulated communication signals to be transmitted. The wireless transceivers convey the modulated communication signals by way of wireless as well as possibly wired communication links not shown to other devices such as cell towers access point hotspots or remote server or a variety of other remote devices.

Depending upon the embodiment the input and output devices of the internal components can include a variety of visual audio and or mechanical outputs. For example the output device s can include one or more visual output devices such as a liquid crystal display and or light emitting diode indicator one or more audio output devices such as a speaker alarm and or buzzer and or one or more mechanical output devices such as a vibrating mechanism. The visual output devices among other things can also include a video screen. Likewise by example the input device s can include one or more visual input devices such as an optical sensor for example a camera lens and photosensor one or more audio input devices such as a microphone and or one or more mechanical input devices such as a flip sensor keyboard keypad selection button navigation cluster touch pad capacitive sensor motion sensor and or switch. Operations that can actuate one or more of the input devices can include not only the physical pressing actuation of buttons or other actuators but can also include for example opening the mobile device unlocking the device moving the device to actuate a motion moving the device to actuate a location positioning system and operating the device.

Additionally while in the input devices are shown to be distinct from the output devices it should be recognized that in some embodiments including the present embodiment one or more devices serve both as input device s and output device s . That is in the present embodiment of the touchscreen display of the mobile device is a user interface that comprises both one or more of the visual output devices insofar as the touchscreen display outputs images as well as one or more of the mechanical input devices insofar as user touch inputs are sensed by the touchscreen display. In other embodiments other types of device scan be used that should be considered both among the input devices and the output devices .

As mentioned above the internal components also can include one or more of various types of sensors . The sensors can include for example proximity sensors e.g. a light detecting sensor an ultrasound transceiver or an infrared transceiver touch sensors altitude sensors and one or more location circuits components that can include for example a Global Positioning System GPS receiver a triangulation receiver an accelerometer a tilt sensor a gyroscope or any other information collecting device that can identify a current location or user device interface of the mobile device . While the sensors for the purposes of are considered to be distinct from the input devices in other embodiments it is possible that one or more of the input devices can also be considered to constitute one or more of the sensors and vice versa . For purposes of the present description the touchscreen display is considered to not be and to not include any of the sensors although the touch sensing capability of that display could alternately be considered as being among the sensors.

The memory portion of the internal components can encompass one or more memory devices of any of a variety of forms e.g. read only memory random access memory static random access memory dynamic random access memory etc. and can be used by the processor portion to store and retrieve data. In some embodiments the memory portion or a portion thereof can be integrated with the processor portion or a portion thereof in a single device e.g. a processing device including memory or processor in memory PIM albeit such a single device will still typically have distinct portions sections that perform the different processing and memory functions and that can be considered separate devices. The data that is stored by the memory portion can include but need not be limited to operating systems programs applications and informational data. Each operating system includes executable code that controls basic functions of the mobile device such as interaction among the various components included among the internal components communication with external devices via the wireless transceivers and or the component interface and storage and retrieval of programs and data to and from the memory portion . One example operating system is discussed in further detail below with respect to .

As for programs each program includes executable code that utilizes an operating system to provide more specific functionality such as file system service and handling of protected and unprotected data stored in the memory portion . Although many such programs govern standard or required functionality of the mobile device in many cases the programs include applications or simply apps governing optional or specialized functionality which can be provided in some cases by third party vendors unrelated to the mobile device manufacturer. The operation of certain example programs applications of the mobile device of the present embodiment are discussed in further detail with reference to particularly in terms of how those programs applications interact with the mobile device operating system and certain hardware components of the mobile device and the external display device .

Finally with respect to informational data this is non executable code or information that can be referenced and or manipulated by an operating system or program for performing functions of the mobile device . Such informational data can include for example data that is preprogrammed upon the mobile device during manufacture or any of a variety of types of information that is uploaded to downloaded from or otherwise accessed at servers or other devices with which the mobile device is in communication during its ongoing operation.

Turning to while demonstrates various hardware components of the mobile device schematically illustrate various software components being executed by the mobile device and in particular the mobile device processor portion . particularly shows how the mobile device software components interact with one another when the external display device is disconnected from the mobile device while shows how the mobile device software components interact with one another when the external display device is connected with or when the external display device is in communication with the mobile device. The switch between operation according to and operation according to typically occurs immediately upon the mobile device sensing that a connection has been established between the mobile device and the external display device for example when a physical plug of a wire forming the wired connection is inserted into the terminal of the mobile device or alternatively when the mobile device senses that a wireless connection such as a Bluetooth connection has been established between the mobile device and the external display device .

Particularly with respect to when the mobile device is operating in a normal mode in which the external display device is not connected with or being driven by the mobile device the software components executed by the processor portion of the mobile device in particular include an Android operating system and other software components that interface the touchscreen display the touchscreen display is shown in for convenience albeit it will be understood that the touchscreen display is not itself a software component but rather is a hardware component .

Although the Android operating system is an operating system software component it will be understood that the other software components are programs applications. Logically therefore the mobile device operating system can be considered distinct from the other software components and thus a dashed line is provided in showing this logical separation. Additionally although the Android operating system software component is referred to as an operating system it should be further understood that this software component can also be considered an Android platform insofar as this software component operates as a mobile or portable device platform that includes a lightweight version of the Linux operating system.

Further although in the present embodiment it is the Android operating system or platform that is operating on the mobile device it should be understood that this is only one example mobile device operating system or platform that can be employed and that in other embodiments one or more other operating systems or platforms can be utilized in addition to or instead of the Android operating system. For example in other embodiments instead of utilizing the Android operating system or platform in the mobile device rather another mobile device operating system platform can be employed including but not limited to the iPhone Windows Mobile Symbian and other types of mobile device operating systems platforms . While the Android operating system platform and one or more of the other aforementioned mobile device operating systems platforms such as that of the iPhone utilize or are based upon forms of Linux in some other embodiments the operating system platform need not utilize or be based upon Linux.

With respect to the other software components these allow for the touchscreen display of the mobile device to operate to both output information images as well as receive input commands via touching from a user by way of a user finger stylus or other actuation device . As shown the other software components include a graphics processing unit application programming interface GPU API and a touchscreen driver each of which is in communication with both the Android operating system and the touchscreen display . More particularly the touchscreen display is driven by way of imaging signals provided by the GPU API . The GPU API provides the imaging signals based upon imaging signals received from the Android operating system . Although the imaging signals can be identical to the imaging signals more typically the imaging signals differ from the imaging signals insofar as the GPU API processes the imaging signals to arrive at the imaging signals which are more suited for the touchscreen display .

Although the imaging signals and GPU API allow for the Android operating system to drive and control outputting imaging by the touchscreen display additional signals are communicated allowing for the Android operating system to receive information corresponding to user input signals including user commands received by the touchscreen display. More particularly as shown the touchscreen display upon receiving user input signals sends touchscreen signals from the touchscreen display to the touchscreen driver . Additionally the touchscreen driver in turn processes the touchscreen signals to arrive at touchscreen driver signals that are then provided to the Android operating system across the dashed line . In the present embodiment the touchscreen signals are absolute coordinate signals indicative of locations on the touchscreen display at which user input signals have been received that is the locations on the touchscreen display that have been touched . The touchscreen driver signals further are absolute coordinate signals in the present embodiment the touchscreen driver can be considered a Linux input device interface to the touchscreen hardware . Notwithstanding the description of the signals provided between the touchscreen display and the touchscreen driver and then on to the Android device operating system in other embodiments these signals can take other forms.

Turning to software component interactions within the mobile device change considerably from that shown in when the mobile device determines that an external display device such as the external display device has been connected to the mobile device. When this occurs the mobile device switches its mode of operation from its normal mode to an external display mode and the Android operating system no longer directly communicates with the other software components but rather a number of additional intermediary software components begin operating. That is when the external display device is connected to the mobile device e.g. is plugged into or otherwise enters into communication with the mobile device the additional intermediary software components are launched and executed by the processor portion in addition to the other software components and the Android operating system . Notwithstanding the above description in some alternate embodiments other triggering events besides the connecting of the external display device to the mobile device can also precipitate the switching of operation between the configuration of and the configuration of .

As described in further detail below the additional intermediary software components serve to interface between the Android operating system and the other software components as well as to allow for communications with the external display device or more particularly to allow for communications with the display of the external display device . Similar to although the touchscreen display as well as the external display device and the display are hardware components devices these components devices are also shown in for convenience to illustrate the relative interactions among the various software components and these hardware components devices. Also similar to a logical distinction can be understood to exist between the Android operating system and the additional intermediary software components as represented by a dashed line and further the additional intermediary software components can be distinguished from the other software components which are the same as in as represented by a dashed line .

As shown the other software components include the same other software components as are shown in the namely the GPU API and the touchscreen driver . Also as in the GPU API provides the imaging signals to the touchscreen display and the touchscreen display provides the touchscreen signals to the touchscreen driver . However in contrast to the arrangement shown in in the imaging signals received from the GPU API are based upon imaging signals received by the GPU API from something other than the Android operating system namely from an event bridge component that is one of the additional intermediary software components . Further instead of the touchscreen driver providing the touchscreen driver signals to the Android operating system in the touchscreen driver signals are provided to the event bridge component .

With respect to the additional intermediary software components these include both the event bridge component and several additional software components. More particularly as shown in addition to the event bridge component the additional intermediary software components include an event forward driver component an X windows component an additional GPU API an Android in a window AIW component and an EAS driver component as well as possibly thought not necessarily one or more applications or Linux programs . The GPU APU can be but need not be the same type of component as is the GPU API . As noted above the additional intermediary software components collectively serve as an interface or bridge between the Android operating system and the other software components and further serve to drive operation of the external display device and associated display . This is achieved by virtue of a number of interactive signals communicated among the intermediary software components and between those additional intermediary software components and each of the Android operating system the external display device and associated display and the other software components .

More particularly in this regard to begin the event bridge component is a Linux user space application that interfaces particularly with the other software components and serves as a virtual input device. Among other things the event bridge component constitutes an executable component that captures input events coming from the touchscreen driver in the form of the touchscreen driver signals and also sends imaging signals namely the imaging signals to the GPU API for eventual transmission typically following processing by the GPU API to the touchscreen display that are intended to cause the touchscreen display to show particular graphical images.

In the present embodiment when the mobile device is operating in the external display mode the event bridge component controls the touchscreen display to display solely or primarily an image representative of a user interface a virtual user interface such as one or both of a trackpad a selective input device allowing for user inputs in a manners similar to that achieved using a mouse type device and a keypad with images of keys. To the extent that a keypad is provided the keys of the keypad can emulate ones of the keys buttons which are physical or hard keys and or be in addition to those hard keys so as to make possible other user inputs e.g. user inputs to control a portrait landscape orientation of the image shown on the touchscreen display . In short the touchscreen display is controlled to operate in one or both simultaneously of a keypad mode and a trackpad mouse mode in which a pointer is particularly available.

Assuming that the touchscreen display is primarily driven by the event bridge component to serve as a user interface the touchscreen signals and touchscreen driver signals particularly are key location signals that are indicative of one or both of i whether location s on the touchscreen display corresponding to displayed key image s have been touched or otherwise selected by a user or ii whether particular location s on the trackpad shown on the touchscreen have been selected by a user. That is the touchscreen signals and touchscreen driver signals particularly include one or both of key indication s that particular keys have been pressed selected and or coordinate indication s that one or more locations have been touched selected. Where coordinate indication s are being provided the touchscreen signals and touchscreen driver signals can particularly provide absolute coordinates values representative of absolute position s on the touchscreen display that have been selected touched by a user.

Notwithstanding the above description it should further be noted that even though in the present embodiment the event bridge component drives the touchscreen display to solely or primarily show user interface features there are some circumstances where the event bridge component causes the touchscreen display to display something other than or in addition to user interface features. In particular this can occur when the event bridge component receives one or more incoming notifications . The incoming notifications can include for example override notifications sent by the Android operating system that should still be displayed on the touchscreen display of the mobile device e.g. in some circumstances notification of an emergency incoming call certain types of news and possibly certain social networking social status information certain messages and certain types of weather information or other real time information . Also the touchscreen display can be controlled to display a notification for a period of time at or subsequent to the time at which the external display device is connected to the terminal of the mobile device. Such a notification can be provided to the event bridge component from the GPU API upon its sensing of the presence of the external display device . Additionally in at least some embodiments the event bridge component can also output outgoing notifications to other system components.

Complementing the role of the event bridge component in interfacing the other software components others of the additional intermediary software components serve to interface the Android operating system namely the AIW component and the EAS driver component . As shown in contrast to where the Android operating system sends the imaging signals for receipt by the GPU API in the Android operating system instead sends out other imaging signals for receipt by the AIW component . Further rather than receiving the touchscreen driver signals from the touchscreen driver as in in the Android operating system receives additional signals from the EAS driver component which provides those additional signals based upon AIW signals received from the AIW component . The EAS driver component in the present embodiment can be considered a Linux input device driver that is used to process the AIW signals and to generate the additional signals for the Android operating system exclusively.

Further with respect to the additional intermediary software components the X windows component serves as a central mediating device in between the AIW component the event bridge component and several other software components. The X windows component in the present embodiment particularly is provided by Linux and provides a windowing type environment logically similar to that provided by Microsoft Windows and includes a Windows Mobile WM application programming interface. While in the present embodiment XWindows is employed in other embodiments other windowing systems again for example Microsoft Windows can be used.

As shown the X windows component is in communication with the event bridge component via the event forward driver component and by virtue of these communications the X windows component receives one or both of key indication information and or coordinate indication information regarding user inputs provided to the touchscreen as discussed above. More particularly in this regard the event bridge component upon receiving the touchscreen driver signals is able to process and then forward related touchscreen input signals to the event forward driver component . The processing performed by the event bridge component can involve for example a conversion of absolute coordinate information into relative coordinate information.

The event forward driver component upon receiving the related touchscreen input signals in turn provides based upon the related touchscreen input signals forwarded touchscreen input signals to the X windows component . The event forward driver can be considered basically a Linux based X windows component that should be plugged in to allow the X windows component to accept events from the event bridge component . By virtue of these communications the X windows component indirectly receives key and or coordinate indication s of user inputs at the touchscreen display .

Upon the forwarded touchscreen input signals being received at the X windows component the X windows component is able to utilize the key coordinate indication information itself and additionally further sends that information on to the AIW component as further touchscreen input signals . The further touchscreen input signals upon being received by the AIW component are used as the basis for the AIW signals provided to the EAS driver component which in turn are processed and provided to the Android operating system as the additional signals . Thus indirectly at least the Android operating system is provided with the same information or substantially the same information as is received by the Android operating system in when the touchscreen driver signals are provided directly to the Android operating system from the touchscreen driver . That is even when the mobile device is operating in the external display mode the Android operating system is still apprised of user inputs at the touchscreen display .

As already noted the Android operating system sends the other imaging signals to the AIW block . Given that the Android operating system in operates in the same or substantially the same manner as shown in insofar as the Android operating system again receives touchscreen input information by way of the additional signals in the other imaging signals can be understood to be the same or substantially the same type of imaging signals as the imaging signals of . Nevertheless as will be discussed in further detail below when the mobile device is operating in the external display mode the other imaging signals are not used to control the images displayed by the touchscreen display since it is rather the imaging signals of the event bridge component that are for this purpose but rather impact what is displayed on the external display device. To format the other imaging signals for this purpose therefore those signals upon being received from the Android operating system at the AIW component in turn are processed by the AIW component to generate AIW imaging signals that are then provided to the X windows component .

In addition to the above interactions as mentioned above the additional intermediary software components in the present embodiment further include the one or more applications or Linux programs that are also operating on the mobile device . The applications or Linux programs can depending upon the embodiment or circumstance take a variety of forms. For example the applications or Linux programs can include any of a variety of programs conventionally run on portable computers or other devices including programs that require or utilize user inputs to govern operation of the program e.g. a word processing program a spreadsheet program a video game a desktop application etc. . Further in the present embodiment the operation of the applications or Linux programs can further influence and or be taken into account in what is displayed on the external display device or display . Also in the present embodiment the applications or Linux programs are designed to take into account or operate based at least partly upon user inputs as provided at the touchscreen display . Thus when the mobile device is operating in the external display mode the further touchscreen input signals are provided not only to the AIW component but also to the applications or Linux programs as shown.

Further to allow for the applications or Linux programs to influence the images displayed on the external display device or display application imaging signals are further provided from those applications Linux programs to the X windows component . Although in the present embodiment the signals from the applications or Linux programs are imaging signals in other embodiments other signals that are not intended to specifically influence imaging can be sent instead of or in addition to the application imaging signals to the X windows component . Further notwithstanding the above description in alternate embodiments no applications or Linux programs need be present or need operate at any given time and or no applications or Linux programs need take into account touchscreen user input information or provide application imaging signals to the X windows component .

Thus as shown in the X windows block in the present embodiment receives several different types of incoming signals from several different sources namely the forwarded touchscreen signals the AIW imaging signals and potentially also the application imaging signals from one or more of the applications or Linux programs . Based upon these signals the X windows block is able to determine an appropriate image often made up of multiple image subportions for display on the external display device or display . More particularly based upon the forwarded touchscreen signals the AIW imaging signals and at least in some embodiments or circumstances the application imaging signals the X windows block generates output imaging signals that are provided to the GPU API . The GPU API in turn then generates further output imaging signals that are output from the terminal of the mobile device and communicated via the wired connection to the external display device or display . The display of the external display device then displays images in accordance with those further output imaging signals .

Given the software components shown in the mobile device and external display device are able operate in concert with one another in a manner that is considerably different from that of the normal mode of . In particular as discussed further below and additionally as illustrated in while in the normal mode the touchscreen display is used not only to receive certain types of user inputs but also to display mobile device operational status information or other information determined by imaging signals provided by the Android operating system in the external display mode it is the external display device rather than the touchscreen display that displays such operational status information provided by the Android operating system rather than the touchscreen displays which instead is controlled to merely display one or both of the aforementioned trackpad and keypad. Further in the external display mode the external display device not only is controlled to display the mobile device operational status information provided by the Android operating system but also is controlled or can be controlled to display additional information such as that provided by the applications or Linux programs by way of the application imaging signals .

More particularly in the external display mode the touchscreen display becomes solely or primarily a user input device intended to receive user inputs and no longer serves or no longer serves primarily as a mechanism for communicating other types of information other than the displaying of the user interface and the operation thereof. The imaging signals communicated from the event bridge component serve solely or primarily to control the generation of an image on the touchscreen display corresponding to a user interface by which a user or users can input information. As discussed above in the present embodiment the user interface that is presented on the touchscreen display is one or both of a trackpad and or a keypad although in other embodiments other types of user interfaces can also be presented e.g. a menu driven user interface . In addition to causing the touchscreen display to display a particular image the imaging signals communicated from the event bridge component further allow the touchscreen display to vary in its appearance to reflect reactions of the user interface to user inputs e.g. if a key of the keypad is pressed then the image of that key is modified to show the pressing response of that key .

Additionally instead of utilizing the touchscreen display to show mobile device operational status information or other information unrelated to the trackpad and or keypad as provided by the Android operating system in the external display mode such operational status information or other information is instead shown on the display of the external display device . The Android operating system continues to operate in the same or substantially the same manner as in the normal mode of with the touchscreen input information or information based thereon being communicated indirectly to the Android operating system via the touchscreen driver the event bridge component the event forward driver component the X windows component the AIW component and the EAS driver component . Further in response to receiving the touchscreen input information at the Android operating system as well as even in the absence of such touchscreen input information the Android operating system further provides to the AIW component the other imaging signals indicative of the mobile device operational status information or other information .

Although the other imaging signals can be used themselves to generate an image just as the imaging signals are used to generate an image in the normal mode corresponding to in the external display mode of the other imaging signals are used to generate only a portion of the image ultimately displayed at the external display device . This is because given the large size of the display of the external display device by comparison with the size of the touchscreen display the external display device can display significant amounts of information above and beyond merely the operational status information or other information that would normally be displayed on the touchscreen display in the normal mode.

To allow for the generation of an overall image on the display of the external display device that encompasses the Android operating system imaging signal output but also includes other possible imaging information and that synthesizes these different image components into the overall image in the present embodiment the AIW component modifies the other imaging signals to generate the AIW imaging signals . In particular the AIW imaging signals allow for the generation of an image subportion a window containing the same or substantially the same information as would be displayed as an overall image across an entire display screen if the other imaging signals were themselves utilized to generate the image as the imaging signals are used to generate an image on the touchscreen display in the normal mode of . In other words the AIW component grabs the screen of the Android operating system and shows content of the Android screen for entry into the X windows component .

Assuming that the X windows component is supplied with the AIW imaging signals rather than the other imaging signals the output imaging signals generated by the X windows component and thus the further output imaging signals output by the GPU API based thereon are representative of a composite overall image that includes not only an image subportion corresponding to the imaging signals from the Android operating system but also one or more additional image subportions corresponding to other information signals. Although the particular basis for the additional subportions can vary depending upon the embodiment in the present embodiment the additional subportions particularly are reflective of the application image signals provided from the applications or Linux programs . Thus in the present embodiment the output imaging signals generated by the X windows component and thus the further output imaging signals for driving the external display device are particularly configured to cause the generation of a composite or synthesized image including both the mobile device operational status information corresponding to the AIW imaging signals as well as image components corresponding to the status or operation of one or more of the applications or Linux programs as indicated by the application imaging signals .

Turning now to an example first image that can be displayed on the touchscreen display and an example second image that can be simultaneously displayed on the display of the external display device are shown to further illustrate operation of the overall mobile device and external display device when the two devices are connected and the mobile device is operating in the external display device mode corresponding to . The first image can also be considered a primary graphical user interface GUI while the second image can be considered a second GUI. As shown when such operation is occurring the first image provided on the touchscreen display particularly includes a keypad including multiple discrete keys as well as a trackpad arrangement that includes left and right selector buttons and a region in which touch inputs from a user can be received. As already discussed thus the first image is configured to serve as an image of a user input device or multiple user input devices at which the user can enter user inputs.

Although the embodiment of shows the image as including both the keypad and trackpad features these are only intended to be examples. For example in other embodiments only the trackpad or the keypad is present or other types of user input interface features are present instead of or in addition to these features. Further in at least some embodiments the touchscreen display imagery is controlled e.g. by the event bridge component so that the user interface features are reoriented e.g. between landscape and portrait arrangements on the touchscreen display depending upon various factors including various inputs provided via the sensors of the mobile device. For example the orientation of the mobile device relative to ground or some other reference point as sensed by one or more sensors can serve as the basis for reorienting one or more features displayed on the touchscreen display .

While the touchscreen display provides the first image the display of the external display device displays other information in the embodiment of . More particularly as shown the second image provided on the display includes a first subportion or window showing an image based upon the AIW imaging signals that as discussed above reflect the other imaging signals provided by the Android operating system . The first subportion is representative of what would be shown on the touchscreen display of the mobile device due to operation of the mobile device on its own if the external display device was not present and the mobile device was operating in the normal mode of . Further for example as shown the first subportion can show a message incoming call . . . from 888 888 8888 indicating that the mobile device is receiving a phone call from an outside phone number which such is occurring.

It will be understood that notwithstanding the particular imagery shown in the first subportion of the particular information displayed by that subportion in any given circumstance or embodiment can vary depending upon the particular circumstances of operation being experienced by the mobile device A variety of types of information can also be displayed. For example the first subportion can alternatively include a text area indicating a text message input from the user as would be recognized by the Android operating system . Also for example in some circumstances the first subportion can display information regarding various types of social networking and or social status information various other forms of messages e.g. email and various types of information such as news weather stock market or other real time information. Also the location of the first subportion within the second image the relative size of that subportion in comparison with the second image and other characteristics can vary depending upon the embodiment.

In addition to the first subportion there also exists a second subportion that occupies the remainder of the second image shown on the display of the external display device . The second subportion depending upon the embodiment or circumstance can include any of a variety of information including any of a variety of information provided by or corresponding to the operation of one or more of the applications or Linux programs that are being executed by or potentially can be executed on the mobile device . In the present example the second subportion in particular includes several icons corresponding to selectable applications that can be run upon the mobile device and also a window portion showing an image associated with a particular application that is already operating namely a word processing document image complete with sub icons that the user can select to influence operation of the word processing application.

Although in the example of both the first and second subportions are present it will be understood that in some cases only the second subportion or the first subportion need be present at a particular moment. For example in some cases the first subportion corresponding to the mobile device operational status as indicated by the other imaging signals of the Android operating system can disappear since nothing of interest is going on with the mobile device at the moment. Alternatively it is possible that the first subportion can be expanded to occupy the entire or almost the entire display of the external display device .

Referring now to an exemplary sequence diagram flow chart is additionally provided to show in further detail example signal flow when the mobile device begins to operate and then continues to operate in the external display mode corresponding to . In the present example operation begins as represented by an arrow indicating that the mobile device is initially operating in the normal mode where the external display device is not yet connected to the mobile device . Next as represented by an arrow the external display device is connected to the mobile device e.g. by a user so as to establish the wired connection . Next as represented by an arrow the mobile device detects is notified that the external display device has been connected to the mobile device and consequently the mobile device launches all of the additional intermediary software components so that those software components are being executed by the processor portion . This is represented by the arrow in that it is point to the X windows component of the additional intermediary software components in particular. Thus the mobile device begins operating in the external display mode of operation and at least the first subportion corresponding to the Android operating system output information regarding mobile device operational status is displayed on the external display device the Android window is brought into focus .

Next the user touches the touchscreen display of the mobile device as represented by an arrow . Upon the touchscreen display being touched in this manner the touchscreen display sends the touchscreen signals including the touchscreen input information particularly key and or absolute coordinate value information to the event bridge component . The communication of this touchscreen input information from the touchscreen display to the event bridge component is particularly represented by an arrow with it being understood that although not shown in this information further passes through the touchscreen driver on its way from the touchscreen display to the event bridge component. Next upon the touchscreen input information being received at the event bridge component the event bridge component determines whether the image displayed on the touchscreen display itself should be updated to reflect the user s input action or for some other reason. For example the image at the touchscreen display potentially can be changed to show the depression of a key displayed on the touchscreen display or a movement of a cursor shown on the display. Thus the imaging signals and then by way of the GPU API are provided back to the touchscreen display as represented by an arrow of .

In addition upon the event bridge component receiving the touchscreen input information it also further provides the related touchscreen input signals to the event forward driver component and the event forward driver component in turn provides the forwarded touchscreen input signals based thereon to the X windows component as represented respectively by arrows and in . As noted while any coordinate information included among the touchscreen input information received by the event bridge component according to the arrow is absolute coordinate value information any coordinate information provided from the event bridge component to the event forward driver component and then to the X windows component is relative coordinate value information.

As already discussed the touchscreen input information received at the X windows component as communicated indirectly from the touchscreen display can be pertinent to operation of the mobile device itself as would be the case regardless of whether the external display device was present as well as pertinent to the operation of one or more of the applications or Linux programs that are operating on the mobile device and the display of which is particularly made possible by way of the external display being present. Thus upon the X windows component receiving the touchscreen input e.g. key or relative coordinate information the X windows component sends that information in the form of the further touchscreen input signals both to the AIW component as represented by an arrow as well as to the applications or Linux programs as indicated by an arrow . Upon receiving the touchscreen input e.g. key or relative coordinate information at the AIW component that component in turn sends that information in the form of the AIW signals to the EAS driver component as represented by a further arrow . As indicated while any coordinate information included among the touchscreen input information received by the AIW component according to the arrow is relative coordinate value information any coordinate information provided from the AIW component to the EAS driver component is absolute coordinate value information.

Upon receiving the AIW signals containing the touchscreen input information the EAS driver component in turn forwards that information in the form of the additional signals to the Android operating system as represented by an arrow . The Android operating system upon receiving the touchscreen input information then determines how the mobile device operation and particularly the display of information corresponding to mobile device operation should change in view of that received information. Upon determining that a particular screen change should be made the Android operating system in turn sends the other imaging signals to the AIW block reflective of the appropriate screen change as represented by an arrow . Since the other imaging signals are configured to cause an entire screen change and yet as discussed above in the external display mode only a subportion window of the overall image displayed by the external display device is to reflect the Android operating system imaging information the AIW component serves to convert the received other imaging signals into the AIW imaging signals . The AIW imaging signals which are suitable for producing a window change corresponding to the Android operating system imaging information are then sent to the X windows component as represented by an arrow more particularly in this regard the AIW detects the changes in the Android presentation and displays the modified graphical image subportion s area s by calling the WM API .

As already noted the X windows component serves to integrate the imaging information provided by the AIW imaging signals reflective of the window change with additional imaging information provided by the applications or Linux programs . Thus upon receiving the application imaging signals from the applications or Linux programs as indicated by an arrow the X windows component generates the output imaging signals based upon both the application imaging signals and the AIW imaging signals and then sends the output imaging signals for receipt by the external display device as indicated by an arrow . It will be understood that sending of the output imaging signals corresponding to the arrow is intended to be representative of the further processing of those imaging signals by the GPU API and corresponding sending of the further output imaging signals to the external display device.

In view of the above description it should be evident that at least some of the disclosed embodiments and or variations thereof provide one or more advantages. To begin when the mobile device is connected to the external display device and operating in the external display mode the user is provided with a large area highly usable built in virtual keyboard and or trackpad device or other user interface . Thus the user can operate the mobile device and applications running thereon such as the applications or Linux programs without carrying other input devices and can particularly achieve efficient entry of entering text and or controlling a desktop environment in which multiple applications are running. The virtual keyboard and or trackpad user interface provided can be a close analog of a real keyboard and or trackpad or mouse type device making the use of the mobile device touchscreen display as a user input device intuitive.

Further through efficient use of the external display device not only is it possible to continue to display mobile device operational status information as provided by the Android operating system but also it is possible to display a wide variety of other types of information and particularly to display significantly greater amounts of information of different types that is possible when merely employing a mobile device alone. Among other things the mobile device operational status information as provided by the Android operating system can be made always visible on the external display device. Further the user can be provided with this information without displaying the information on the touchscreen display of the mobile device itself that is the information can be made available without limiting the efficacy of the touchscreen display as a user input device by taking up precious space on the touchscreen display for the display of such information. Additionally multiple ones of the applications or Linux programs or other applications can be run using the mobile device as the platform forming the desktop environment. That is at least some embodiments enable the use of full blown windowing systems and window based applications in mobile devices which can allow leveraging of the phone to provide a desktop windowing environment on which on which one or more desktop applications can be utilized.

Additionally a variety of other benefits are achieved in at least some embodiments. For example the mobile device platform and applications work as expected on the external display device without code modifications as the screen resolution and size reported to them do not or need not change. Also mobile device applications working concurrently can be displayed separately in different display surfaces such as other windows or tabs. This makes it faster and easier to switch between applications and gives the user awareness of the applications running concurrently. Also a user can respond to an incoming call by using the image portion of the image displayed on the external display device that is the window showing mobile device operational status as provided by the Android operating system as displayed on the second GUI to employ the mobile device as a hands free phone or by disconnecting the external display device e.g. HDTV cable to engage in private conversations.

Further notwithstanding the above description the present invention is intended to encompass a variety of other embodiments in addition to those discussed above. For example in some embodiments given that in the external display mode the touchscreen display is an active display the trackpad area can be configured to give visual cues to the user e.g. messages photos videos etc. as appropriate. Also for example in some additional embodiments the external display device can also serve as a touchscreen or otherwise allow for user inputs. In some such embodiments user inputs such as gestures are particularly sensed in terms of how those gestures relate to the first subportion of the overall image displayed on the external display device that is to the window corresponding to the output of the Android operating system . In such embodiments there can be two way communications between the external display device and the mobile device .

Also for example in some embodiments the touchscreen display of the mobile device is configured to sense a variety of additional e.g. non standard gestures including for example multi touch gestures. Further in some embodiments in which the external display device is capable of receiving user inputs in addition to the mobile device touchscreen display but where the external display device is only capable of receiving certain types of user inputs but not others again for example non standard gestures the mobile device can operate to supercede the operation of the external display device in this regard if appropriate for example if the mobile device s window is in focus. For example gestures made over the first subportion again the window corresponding to the output of the Android operating system phone are passed through to mobile device touchscreen display the primary GUI .

Thus it is specifically intended that the present invention not be limited to the embodiments and illustrations contained herein but include modified forms of those embodiments including portions of the embodiments and combinations of elements of different embodiments as come within the scope of the following claims.
