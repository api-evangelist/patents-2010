title: High power single crystal piezoelectric transformer
abstract: A piezoelectric transformer includes a single crystal relaxor ferroelectric element poled along a [0 1] direction and selected from the group consisting of PZN-PT, PMN-PZT, PZN-PT and PMN-PT. The element has two opposed surfaces substantially perpendicular to the [0 1] direction with an input electrode and an output electrode positioned on one surface. The output electrode is isolated from electrical communication with the input electrode. A ground electrode is positioned on the second, opposed surface. Input electrical energy results in piezoelectric change in the element that is mechanically coupled through the element to generate piezoelectric output energy.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The present invention is directed generally towards piezoelectric transformers and in particular to improvements in efficiency and power density for high power single crystal piezoelectric transformers. Naval and commercial applications of the present invention include compact AC DC or DC DC adaptor chargers for personal computers communication devices and portable x ray units. The transformer can be combined to drive ultrasonic motors and motion devices for integration with unmanned autonomous vehicles in lieu of electromagnetic devices thereby eliminating electromagnetic radiation and interference problems with navigation devices.

A piezoelectric transformer is a two port element that steps up or steps down AC voltages or current via converse and direct piezoelectric effects. These devices were developed in the late 1950 s and described for example in C. Rosen s U.S. Pat. No. 2 974 296 incorporated by reference herein in its entirety for background information only.

The first commercial realization for piezoelectric transformers was in the early 1990s as a voltage step up to ignite the cold cathode fluorescent tube CCFT for backlighting flat screens in displays and notebook computers.

Compared with the conventional transformer which uses magnetic coupling between input and output the piezoelectric transformer uses acoustic coupling. Generally the input and output parts of the piezoelectric transformer have separate electrodes. An input voltage is applied to drive the device at the resonance frequency and the mechanical vibration is transformed to the electrical output through the piezoelectric effect.

Piezoelectric transformers exhibit many advantages over electromagnetic transformers. They possess higher power density no electromagnetic noise better efficiency at resonance easier miniaturization and simpler fabrication.

Virtually all current piezoelectric transformers are fabricated from piezoelectric ceramics such as lead zirconate titanate Pb Zr Ti 03 PZT and its derivatives. Transformer geometries and polarization patterns that are suitable for piezoelectric ceramic processes are discussed in the Rosen patent. Mainly two polarization schemes have been in use for piezoelectric transformers and they are still in use to date transversely polarized regions for input and output or a continuously polarized element.

Subsequent advances on the original Rosen patent include multilayer transformers given in S. Priya et al. Multilayered Unipoled Piezoelectric Transformers Japanese Journal of Applied Physics Vol. 43 No. 6A 2004 pp. 3503 3510 2004 R. Bishop et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 834 882 a thickness mode vibration piezoelectric transformer by T. Inoue et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 118 982 and a multimode adjustable piezoelectric transformer by Y. Lee et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 504 384. Each of the above patents is herein incorporated by reference in their entirety for background information only.

Ferroelectric single crystals such as Pb ZnNb 0 PbTi0 PZN PT and Pb MgNb 0 PbTi0 PMN PT exhibit large electromechanical coupling coefficients and high electric field induced strains. Due to these advantages compared to traditional polycrystalline piezoelectric ceramics single crystals are a promising alternative to develop new generation devices.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 674 222 to Masters et al. herein incorporated by reference in its entirety for background information only describes a Rosen type single crystal PZN PT transformer design. First the noted low mechanical Qof single crystal PZN PT is a serious drawback and limits the transformer to low power applications. As is well known low mechanical Qpiezoelectric materials cannot sustain high power levels because of overheating. Second the transformer designs presented in the Masters patent with the exception of one type are suitable for piezoelectric ceramic elements but not for single crystals for the following fundamental reasons.

The crystallographic symmetry of an unpolarized body is consistent with the spherical Curie group mm . Therefore Rosen type transformers plates discs etc. with two orthogonally polarized regions each possessing the symmetry of mm can be easily fabricated.

Nonetheless this is not true for the relaxor ferroelectric single crystals such as PZN PT. In relaxor ferroelectric materials the dielectric constant decreases when the material is subjected to an increasing electrical frequency. In this case there exists definite directions in the crystals where the polarization vector is allowed. Other directions are forbidden and this fact must be considered as an integral part of any single crystal transformer design rules and the selection of the vibration modes.

The two major problems with the Masters relaxor ferroelectric PZN PT single crystal patent are in high power applications the low mechanical Q leads to device overheating and eventual destruction of the transformer and most of the proposed designs are not commensurate with the allowed polarization directions in the crystal. This latter deficiency makes it impossible to reduce the design to practice.

Accordingly it is an object of the present invention to provide a piezoelectric transformer to overcome the above and other shortcomings in the prior art.

The inventive piezoelectric transformer includes a single crystal relaxor ferroelectric element poled along a 0 1 direction and selected from the group consisting of PZN PT PMN PZT PZN PT and PMN PT. The element has two opposed surfaces substantially perpendicular to the 0 1 direction with an input electrode and an output electrode positioned on one surface. The output electrode is isolated from electrical communication with the input electrode. A ground electrode is positioned on the second opposed surface. Input electrical energy results in piezoelectric change in the element that is mechanically coupled through the element to generate piezoelectric output energy.

Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description drawings and claims.

The key advances of the present invention over the single crystal PZN PT and piezoceramic PZT materials previously used in transformers have been experimentally verified. The following advances have been shown.

Two incongruent crystallographic orientations have been shown to exist that are suitable for high power transformers as shown in sample 5 kand sample 6 k.

Acceptor doping with manganese into the kand kcrystallographic orientations has been shown whereby the mechanical Q see Table I below was enhanced to levels approaching six times of the reported value in the prior art for single crystal PZN PT. This occurred without affecting the high electromechanical coupling. The power density of piezoelectric transformer is related with the mechanical quality factor Q and the electromechanical coupling coefficient k.

Fabrication of a thermally stable high power density single crystal transformer is shown with up to five times the power density of hard PZT piezoceramics and 45 higher efficiency see the results in Table I . This can result in either an 80 size and weight reduction of current PZT transformers for the same power output or a five fold increase in the power output for the same size transformer.

Alternate easily polarized and manufactured transformer designs see B A and B have also been developed that do not violate the crystallographic design rules.

Table I below lists empirically derived data of various materials tested for use in a piezoelectric transformer including maximum power densities and efficiencies mechanical quality factors and electromechanical coupling coefficients for each material.

Specifically the six samples tested with results provided in Table I are composed of well known single crystal materials. The APC 841 is a conventional PZT ceramic material used for transformers. Each of the PMN PT samples were derived with different orientations as shown in B and C. Notice that samples 4 and 5 were doped with manganese. Testing was also performed on samples doped with indium and iron however the best results were obtained by doping with manganese.

For each sample the maximum power density was measured in watts per cubic centimeter maximum efficiency was calculated using the input and output power the mechanical quality factor Qwas measured and the electromechanical coupling coefficient kwas measured.

We have experimentally proven that the single crystal piezoelectric transformer of the present invention exhibits much better performance in terms of power density than the conventional hard piezoceramic PZT transformers if the poling direction cutting orientation and dopant type are selected properly. The advantage is significant for the devices of power density larger than 10 W cmas is evident when examining the results of Table I. Generally various types and configurations of transformers can be improved by using single crystal materials such as Pb MgNb 0 PbTi0 PMN PT and Pb ZrNb 0 PbTi0 PZN PT .

It should be noted that the configuration with uni directional poling is preferred in the sense of simplicity and production cost considering the manufacturing process of relaxor based piezoelectric single crystals. Initially 17 3 31 mm plates of lead zirconate titanate PZT ceramics undoped and manganese doped PMN PT single crystals were manufactured. Properties of these materials are listed in Table I.

Specifically hard PZT APC84 I a product of APC International was utilized and the 0.79 Pb MgNb 0 0.21PbTi0single crystal samples were fabricated using a solid state crystal growth SSCG technique such as that taught in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2009 0211515. Other techniques can be used for this. The single crystals were cut in three orientations see B C 

Next the top electrode was separated into three parts and each 5 mm in length in the current embodiment and the bottom electrode was left as the common ground. In this embodiment the center portion of the top electrode was used for output as an output electrode and portions and were used for input as input electrodes. Under the input and output configuration of the transformer worked as a voltage booster step up transformer . The experimental results and material properties are also summarized in Table I.

The maximum power density is defined as the output power per unit specimen volume when the temperature of the sample s nodal point rises by 10 C. above room temperature. For single crystals Qand kvaried with poling direction and cutting orientation. The mechanical quality factors were enhanced by hard doping with manganese in the preferred embodiment during the crystal formulation process. The efficiency and power density are generally related with the product of Qand K.

Materials with high mechanical quality factor and coupling coefficient are preferred in the transformer application. Compared to PZT ceramics single crystals have a relatively small mechanical quality factor Q but significantly higher coupling coefficients k. Therefore as shown by the results of Table I fabrication and testing of several single crystal samples showed better high power performances than ceramics and the power density of 38 W cm3 was observed for Sample 6 in Table I which was 5 times that of the PZT Sample 1 of Table I also shown in . Single crystal elements were tested using manganese indium and iron as dopants. While indium and iron had some beneficial effect the best results were obtained using manganese.

Empirical test prove that hard doping is essential to increase the mechanical quality factor and the power density of the single crystal. Poling along the 0 1 direction exhibits higher power density than the 001 direction.

In the experiment sinusoidal signals were produced by a function generator and amplified by a power amplifier. Each sample was driven in the kvibration mode around the second resonant frequency. A 1.5 k resistor was connected to the output as the load which is close to the matching impedance and the output power was kept constant throughout one frequency sweep. An infrared spot thermometer was used to monitor the temperature rise at the center of the plate i.e. the nodal point of the sample with the maximum heat generation. Each sample was run for several sweeps with different output power levels while all the data including voltages currents and temperatures were logged. The maximum power density is defined as the output power per unit volume when the temperature of the sample s nodal point rises by 10 C. above room temperature. Furthermore the voltage gain and efficiency were simultaneously calculated using the input and output data.

A second embodiment and suitable configuration for the application of a single crystal transformer is illustrated in . is a top view of a uni poled transformer having a ring dot electrode pattern. Ring dot electrode pattern has an inner electrode and an outer electrode formed on one surface of a single crystal piezoelectric element .

The areas of inner and outer electrodes and determine the step up ratio efficiency and impedance characteristics. The disk shaped transformer of this embodiment exhibited better performance than the rectangular plate shape in terms of power density.

Many other embodiments of the present invention are available such as multilayer structures i.e. stacking of layers which can be utilized to further improve the power level. A multi layer design as in can provide high gain and high power at a lower cost. These multi layer designs use an electrode pattern similar to that shown in and wherein an input electrode surrounds an output electrode and appears in two places because of the cross sectional view.
