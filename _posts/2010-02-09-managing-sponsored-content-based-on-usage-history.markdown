The wireless search platform illustrated in may contain a wireless communication facility . The wireless communication facility may be for example a cellular telephone tower that routes the user s query. It may be associated with a wireless provider a locator facility or mobile search host facilities . The wireless search platform may include a wireless provider .

The wireless search platform illustrated in may contain a locator facility enabling the collection of geographic or other location data on users of mobile communication facilities . A locator facility may be based upon i a Cell sector System that collects information pertaining to cell and sector ID s ii the Assisted Global Positioning Satellite A GPS technology utilizing a GPS chipset in the mobile communication facility iii standard GPS technology iv Enhanced Observed Time Difference E OTD technology utilizing software residing on a server and within the mobile communication facility that uses signal transmission of time differences received by geographically dispersed wireless communication facilities to pinpoint a user s location v Time Difference of Arrival TDOA vi Time of Arrival TOA vii Angle of Arrival AOA viii TDOA AOA ix triangulation of cellular signals x triangulation based on receipt of broadcast TV signals xi location based on dead reckoning xii location based on proximity to known locations including locations of other mobile communications facilities xiii map based location or any combination of any of the foregoing as well as other location facilities known to those of skill in the art.

In embodiments the mobile communication facility may use a locator facility e.g. GPS system to locate itself in its present location or locations of interest to the user whether explicitly stated or determined by PIM data location history or previous searches. In embodiments the location may be transmitted back to the locator facility for dissemination processing etc. Geographic information systems may also be used to determine a location point in a polygon a location radius search route calculation points of interest and or geocoding and reverse geocoding. In embodiments a user s location may also be self entered into the wireless platform by the user. For example the user may type in or speak through a voice recognition system an address zip code or other location information.

In an embodiment a GPS system may be used as the locator facility. The GPS system consists of a group of satellites 20 carrying atomic clocks that orbit the Earth twice a day. Earth based observatories record orbital data related to the motion of the satellites. In order to determine global positioning a GPS receiver e.g. one disposed inside of the mobile communication facility must communicate with four of the GPS satellites. The receiver computes its distance from each of the four satellites to determine its latitude longitude elevation and time of day. The receiver computes the distance to each of the four satellites by calculating the difference between local time and the time the satellite signals were sent and then decodes the satellites locations from their radio signals and an internal database. The location of the GPS receiver is located at the intersection of the four spheres created by the four satellites where each radius is equal to the time delay between the satellite and the receiver multiplied by the speed of the radio signals. The differences permit calculation of three hyperboloids of revolution of two sheets the intersection point of which gives the precise location of the receiver. If the elevation of the receiver is known it is possible to compute precise location using only three satellites.

The wireless search platform illustrated in may contain a data facility containing mobile subscriber characteristics pertaining to individual users of a mobile communication facility . This data may include but is not limited to data collected by the wireless provider when an individual opens a wireless account such as age sex race religion area code home address work address billing address credit card information passwords family information e.g. mother s maiden name birthplace driver s license number employer position annual income income bracket items purchased friends and family information including any of the foregoing types of information and the like. The mobile subscriber characteristics facility may continually or periodically update data for individual users for example bill amount s average bill total payment history on time payment history on line usage amount duration of on line interactions number of on line interactions family status and family information number of children shopping habits e.g. views of or purchases of goods and services click stream information device type and device version device characteristics usage patterns including those based on location time of day or other variables device and or subscriber unique identifiers content viewing history content presented for viewed by not viewed by user content and programs downloaded videos music and audio listened to and or downloaded television watched timing and duration of viewing downloading transaction history and any other user or user defined characteristics. The purchase of physical goods may be facilitated by a wireless provider by having the wireless provider collect the user s credit card information as part of the billing cycle and adding goods transactions automatically to the wireless provider s bill to the user.

The mobile subscriber characteristics database may also track data related to phone usage and location. For example data collected could include a history of phone calls made phone calls received the mobile subscriber characteristics of the persons calling or called by the user the duration of calls a history of communications made via phone Internet email instant messaging or chat and the entities communicated with by these technologies history of phone calls made linked with geographic location information at the time of each call log of phone numbers and a history of clicks and clickthroughs or other keystroke or user interface equivalents thereof including voice initiated actions made using the mobile communication facility .

The wireless search platform illustrated in may contain mobile search host facilities . Within the mobile search host facility there may be other facilities including but not limited to a disambiguation facility search facility algorithm facility results facility parental control facility privacy facility transactional security facility carrier business rules facility voice recognition facility sponsorship facility and or an implicit query facility . The mobile search host facility may also link to another data facility .

The disambiguation facility may complete or provide more meaning to ambiguous active user inputs. The disambiguation facility may include SMS lingo translation single word initial substring completion multiple word substring completion stem completion e.g. single into plural format verb into gerund thesaurus lookups for homonyms or synonyms spell check algorithms spell check tables phonetic spelling algorithms phonetic spelling tables phone number keypad to word conversion including completion of possible substrings from number sequence frequency based algorithms semantic analysis algorithms location based algorithms or other algorithms or facilities for reducing ambiguity as to the meaning of a query or partial query entered by a user.

The search facility may initiate a search such as by causing a query optionally a disambiguated query to be executed on a search facility such as a search engine. The search engine might be a search facility that is based on Boolean search logic categories of results term frequencies document frequencies documents selected by other users who have entered similar queries link structures of possible results or any other known search facilities using any other known search algorithm.

The algorithm facility may receive a user s input in the form of a problem and evaluate that problem by applying the set of all potential solutions available within the search space. At its most basic the algorithm facility may apply na ve uninformed search algorithms consisting of the most intuitive solution s available within the search space. Alternatively the algorithm facility may also employ informed search algorithms based on heuristics that utilize intelligence about the elements of the search space in order to minimize search time and resource allocation of the algorithm facility . The algorithm may serve to promote or demote content for display to the user based upon the frequency of queries the frequency of clicks or clickthroughs the velocity of queries the site of the search launch storefront visit or mobile website community tagging mobile user scoring or it may be based upon domain restrictions e.g. only espn.com .

An algorithm may be designed to create an index for information specific to the mobile communication facility . For example the algorithm may look only for mobile tags e.g. WML xHTML MP MIME types such as text WAP and or WML or mobile specific headers . An algorithm may also determine the aesthetic compatibility between the content and the capabilities of the display of the mobile communication facility including factors such as page width page weight e.g. the number of images and byte size screen resolution and color capabilities font types and sizes client side rendering capabilities page complexity e.g. features incompatible or specific to a mobile communication facility and the like. This compatibility information may also be blended with other information such as popularity data e.g. WAP gateway editorial scoring and or traffic market data .

The algorithm facility may contain a collaborative filtering protocol category filtering a recommendation system and or other process facilities for analyzing refining or filtering user input and or search results. A collaborative filter may employ a two step process. During the first step other users are identified who have similar rating patterns as those of the active user. Secondly the ratings obtained from these similar users provide the empiric basis for predicting information of relevance to the active user. The collaborative filter can be both an inclusive and an exclusive process gathering relevant information for the active user or removing incongruent information from the predictive information set.

A collaborative filtering protocol generally involves the collection of preference data from a large group of users. This preference data may be analyzed statistically to identify subgroups or characteristics of subgroup members with similar preference profiles. Various weighted average fuzzy logic or other techniques may be used to summarize or model a preference subgroup and a preference function may be created using the model summary. This function may then be used to match new users to an appropriate preference subgroup. In embodiments such information may be collected from many individual mobile subscriber characteristic data sets and data may be collected from many mobile communication facility users. For example a wireless provider may collect preference data from a large group of its customers. In embodiments the data may be collected from non mobile users and may relate to preference information collected from other on line or off line activities.

User preferences may be derived from user behavior or other implicit characteristics or explicitly defined by a mobile communication facility user or some combination of these. If users were to explicitly state their preferences e.g. for types of restaurants books e commerce music news video formats audio etc. the explicit preference information may be stored in the mobile subscriber characteristic data bases associated with their phones. Users may implicitly register a preference through activity such as purchasing a product online visiting a site on line making a phone call from a mobile communication facility making a phone call from another facility viewing content or engaging or not engaging in other activities. For example if the user looks at a product and decides not to purchase the product one can draw an inference that the user is not interested in the product and this inference may be used as part of a collaborative filtering algorithm. In addition inferences may be drawn from the types of establishments the user has been calling recently on the mobile communication facility. If he or she has been calling auto dealerships repeatedly over the past two weeks an inference can be drawn that the user is presently looking for auto goods and or services. Implicit preferences of users may also be collected by recording all pages that are visited by users and the frequency and or duration of each visit. Using a binary coding scheme in which visited pages are coded 1 and unvisited pages 0 one may create user based preference vectors and analyze statistically for both intra user and inter user cluster preferences or similarities. Other coding techniques may group certain sites along dimensions of commonality with navigation behavior analyzed using any number of Euclidean or other distance and or matching techniques. In embodiments user preference data may be collected from within the mobile subscriber characteristics database. In embodiments user preference data may be collected from outside of the mobile subscriber characteristics database. In embodiments off line behavior may also be used to characterize the preferences of the user.

In embodiments a basic implementation of a collaborative filtering algorithm entails tracking the popularity of a product service business transaction or website by recording the total number of users in the set that rate it favorably which may include a degree of favorability or by recording the number of users that repeatedly visit the site. In essence this algorithm assumes that what previous users liked new users will like. In embodiments a weighted averaging process is implemented to carve out subgroups of users who all highly ranked a product that has an overall unpopular rating with the overall user dataset.

A more robust collaborate filtering procedure sometimes referred to as the K nearest neighbor algorithm uses a training data set that is based upon previous users behavior to predict a variable of interest to members of a target data set comprised of new users. In addition to user preference data the training data set may have additional predictor variables such as might be contained in a mobile subscriber characteristics database e.g. age income sex date or place of birth etc. . Variables of interest may include type of product purchased amount of purchase and so forth. For each row single user data in the target data set the algorithm locates the K closest members of the training data set. Closeness or distance as used by the algorithm is generally a Euclidean Distance measure. Next the algorithm finds the weighted sum of the variable of interest for the K nearest neighbors where the weights are the inverse of the calculated distances. This process is then repeated for all remaining rows in the target set. From this information models may be derived for future prediction. As the user population increases the training data set may be updated to include new rows and thus capture any changes in user preference for use in revising the prediction model.

Other methods that may also be used successfully for statistical clustering of user preference groups include the weighted majority Bayesian prediction Pearson product correlation and factor analysis.

In addition to or instead of collaborative filtering or other preferential treatment of various information as determined by other methods non preferential or objective type data may be employed to further target search results about the user of a mobile communication facility . For example a location of the user may be determined through a GPS system or other location based service and this location may be used to filter results with or without the use of a collaborative filter. In embodiments elements such as time of day type of device activities associated with time of day activities associated with location invoice activity and the like may be used to further refine a search. In an embodiment such information may be used in a category style filter i.e. a filter designed to include or exclude results based on the data . In embodiments such information may be used by a collaborative filter algorithm. In embodiments such information may be used to filter results without being considered in the collaborative filter algorithm.

In embodiments data used in the process of obtaining search results refining search queries making corrections making suggestions disambiguating search queries categorizing results performing explicit or implicit searches filtering collaboratively filtering or performing other processes defined herein may be stored in a database e.g. a relational database . In embodiments the data may be mined associating linked extracted or otherwise manipulated or used. For more information relating to the association and mining of such data refer to the following document incorporated herein by reference by Sunita Sarawagi Shiby Thomas Rakesh Agrawal published by the IBM Almaden Research Center see Appendix B .

A recommendation system may use information from a user s profile to make predictions regarding other information products that might interest the user. Data used in the recommendation system may be obtained through the use of explicit and implicit data collection. Explicit collection refers to data collected from users who for example are directly rating items ranking products stating preferences listing favorites or least favorites etc. Implicit collection refers to data collected as for example a byproduct of user behavior such as products viewed in an online store or products purchased. The recommendation system may compare the collected data to similar data collected from others and calculates a list of recommended items for the active user.

Suggestions may be generated for display based upon each keystroke the user enters into the mobile communication facility . Suggestions may be cached locally on the mobile communication facility and blended with the performance of server updates in order to optimize the overall performance of the wireless platform . Updates may also be provided to the cache memory of the mobile communication facility without requiring a user keystroke. Additional suggestions may be supplied to users by ranking content based upon popularity the frequency of query activity frequency within content the acceleration of the frequency of content the frequency of purchases the sales conversion rate as well as any changes that occur to any of these metrics. Suggestion lists can also be derived by de dupping with frequent terms such as Tyra Banks out of 1 2 3 and categorizing for instance by title artist or a yellow pages type taxonomy or other subject matter organization. The suggestions may be specific to a mobile communication facility mobile subscriber characteristic result facilities carrier business rules and or search algorithm facilities . Suggestions may be dynamically displayed in a Java or BREW application. Suggestions may also be presented in a browser. For example if a user types BR SP as their query the responding WAP page may ask the user if they intended on entering Britney Spears or Bruce Springsteen. Then the user may click on the link of the intended query.

Recommendations may be specific to a mobile communication facility mobile subscriber characteristic result facilities carrier business rules and or sponsor facilities . Providing a recommendation to the user about other relevant content may be done either during search result display or after a search item has been selected. The relationships between items may be based on transactions searches and query behaviors and may include cross selling products e.g. recording artists within the same genre or offering users additional products and services e.g. offering a taxi service following a user s purchase of movie tickets in an urban setting . Query classification may use a yellow pages type taxonomy e.g. restaurants or physicians or for inferring that a five digit number is a postal zip code and may be specific to a mobile communication facility mobile subscriber characteristic delivery facility disambiguation facility and or parental controls . The wireless platform may also use keyword mapping to a query classification based upon taxonomy. For example a user query of screwdriver may map onto the category hardware. This keyword mapping may be specific to a mobile communication facility mobile subscriber characteristic delivery facility disambiguation facility and or parental controls.

The results facility may include general content and services specific content catalogs carrier premium content carrier portal content device based results or home computer desktop search results. The general content and services provided in the results facility could be podcasts websites general images available online general videos available online websites transcoded for MCF or websites designed for mobile browser facilities.

The carrier premium content provided in the results facility may include ringtones monophonic polyphonic or real tones ringback music streaming MP3 video games screensavers images designed for cell phones mobile books or other mobile applications. Carrier portal content includes news such as the current top stories entertainment business technology and finance and sports weather stock quotes and account information. Device based results provided in the results facility may include messaging such as SMS MMS and instant messaging email chat PIM address book and monetary services for a mobile wallet. Finally home computer desktop search results may include text documents Portable Document Format PDF documents maps in various formats including annotated maps or a similar facility spreadsheets presentations photos and images web pages email IM and chat.

Ordering and displaying search results may be based upon a mobile communication facility mobile subscriber characteristic delivery facility disambiguation facility parental controls search algorithm facilities carrier business rules and or a sponsorship facility . The ordering of content for display may also be based upon the amount of content available within a category. The display may be changed based upon the screen size of the mobile communication facility and sounds or other multimedia content may adapt to capabilities of the mobile communication facility . Ordering and display of content may be organized by the type of content the artist the date or concept e.g. Jaguar as a car or jaguar as an animal and other categories may derive from deduction within the mobile search host facilities . In addition to ordering content may be emphasized or deemphasized by weighting within the display . For example weighting may occur through the use of size motion lack of symmetry use of garish colors sounds multimedia or other means of accenting content. For sponsored links there may be opportunities for yield optimization e.g. clicks multiplied by the bid cost .

The parental controls function may be set up by the wireless provider at the time that the user account is created. A web based interface may be used for changing or modifying the parent controls and for entering changing the password protection. Alternatively the parental controls may also be managed via an interface contained within the mobile communication facility .

The privacy facility may include one or more facilities for protecting user privacy such as an encryption facility for encrypting sensitive user data. The privacy facility may also include a facility for protecting the user from undesired content such as unwanted commercial email spam spyware viruses or the like. A privacy facility may for example filter such content prior to revealing results or may in other embodiments suggest modified queries that are less likely to reveal a user s confidential information or that are less likely to return undesired content. A privacy facility may also function in a manner similar to a secure channel such as via VPN with a wireless provider . This secure channel may permit sensitive information to be shared securely.

The transactional security facility may contain additional privacy and parental control settings transactional security settings for the protection of wireless shopping and the management of digital rights. In embodiments such a facility may include password based security a public key private key facility or other suitable security protocol for ensuring the authenticity of the participants in a transaction that is executed using the mobile communications facility .

The carrier business rules of the wireless provider may be associated with or included in the mobile search host facilities . These rules may govern what content users may access e.g. walled garden vs. non walled garden where within the user interface sponsor logos and links are placed which sponsor facilities are included rules for the inventory of advertisements rules allowing categories of transactions by users e.g. based on access conditions employer controls parental controls or the like and managing auctions. In the instance of duplicate information occurring in a search result the preferred provider s content may be given priority over others.

In addition to voice recognition residing on the mobile communication facility it may be contained within the mobile search host facilities and use both software algorithms and hardware based solutions for accurate voice recognition.

The sponsorship facility stores premium content from sponsors that pay the wireless provider to display this content to relevant users. Sponsors information may link to a web site visited by the user i.e. pay per click or link to a call i.e. pay per call . Sponsor information may include information that is text only graphic information in the form of photographs graphic art designs or video as well as various combinations of these. Sponsor information may also take the form of an interactive software application i.e. a game or special ringtones e.g. jamtones . Sponsor information may be displayed to users based on the relation of the sponsor information and user search queries results lists items or categories and the websites visited by the user. Web pages may display content for syndicated ads or links for syndicated ads. Furthermore the wireless search platform illustrated in may contain the sorts of sponsor information described above in a separate database .

The implicit query facility provides for the display of relevant content to users based on user activities other than explicit search queries. For example in GPS data the locator facility may indicate that the cell phone user is in the vicinity of a sponsor s restaurant. In addition the clock contained in the mobile communication facility and or the wireless communication facility may indicate that it is mid evening. A predictive algorithm could merge this information and make the implicit query that the user is interested in restaurants in his immediate vicinity at which he could purchase dinner and then push content ads phone numbers menus reviews to his mobile communication facility for immediate display. Other implicit queries could similarly be based upon a user s parental controls the carrier business rules results facility and so forth either alone or in combination.

The wireless search platform illustrated in may contain a server and database connected to the Internet. Databases connected to the wireless platform over the Internet may store information such as individual business websites with which the user transacts.

The wireless search platform illustrated in may contain a database storing wireless carrier business rules . The carrier business rules may prioritize advertising content see walled garden content below based on the financial interests of the wireless provider or the importance of the sponsor . Additional carrier business rules may include those described herein and in the documents incorporated by reference herein.

The wireless search platform illustrated in may contain a database storing walled garden content . Walled garden content may be content from which the wireless provider derives additional revenues based for example on user clickthroughs or content downloads e.g. ringtones wall paper ringbacks music videos . Because of this additional revenue the wireless provider through its carrier business rules may ensure that this advantageous content is given priority over search results that are equally relevant but do not have financial benefits for the wireless provider .

Once the initial explicit and or implicit query is made the query is processed and the initial results retrieved . Both the query and the initial retrieved results may undergo additional filtering and aggregation . Walled garden content and sponsored content may also attach to the query and present tailored results to the user. The results may also in turn trigger the posting of additional sponsor messages and advertisements. Information from pay per click PPC sponsors may link to the results making it possible for the user to quickly learn about sponsors services phone numbers addresses hours of operation sales and so forth. If the start of the query entry for example undergoes redirection it may either be routed back to the query stage or immediately present the user with the results based upon the query. Once results are retrieved but prior to display the content may be tested for compatibility with the user s mobile communication facility by using a spider to run mock compatibility trials during which it emulates the processing characteristics of a broad array of commercially available wireless communication facilities including the user s mobile communication facility type in order to determine the content within the result set that is compatible with the user s mobile communication facility .

The query results may be ordered prior to display based for example upon the sponsor mobile subscriber characteristics information relating to the mobile communication facility location carrier rules filter results and or walled garden priorities. Once the results are displayed the user may initiate interactions transactions with the information e.g. placing a call click on a link or an online order that is then delivered wirelessly through the wireless platform described in .

Referring back to a wireless communication facility may be an equipment enclosure antenna antenna support structure and any associated facility used for the reception or transmittal of a radio frequency microwave or other signal for communications. An antenna may include a system of poles panels rods reflecting discs or similar devices used for the transmission or reception of radio frequency signals. An antenna may be an omni directional antenna such as a whip antenna that transmits and receives radio frequency signals in a 360 degree radial pattern a directional antenna such as a panel antenna that transmits and receives radio frequency signals in a specific directional pattern of less than 360 degrees or a parabolic antenna such as a dish antenna a bowl shaped device for the reception and or transmission of radio frequency communication signals in a specific directional pattern. Other antennae that may be included in a wireless communication facility are accessory antenna devices such as test mobile antennas and global positioning antennas which are less than 12 inches in height or width excluding the support structure.

Other examples of devices that may comprise a wireless communication facility include a lattice tower a wireless communication support structure which consists of metal crossed strips or bars to support antennas and related equipment a monopole which is a wireless communication facility consisting of a support structure and related equipment including all equipment ancillary to the transmission and reception of voice and data. Such equipment may include but is not limited to cable conduit and connectors stanchions monopoles lattice towers wood poles or guyed towers.

A wireless provider may include any for profit non profit or governmental entity offering wireless communication services. A wireless provider may include services utilizing a broad array of wireless technologies and or spectra including but not limited to Cellular Advanced Wireless Services AWS Spectrum Broadband PCS Narrowband PCS Paging Wireless Communications WCS Wireless Medical Telemetry WMTS Specialized Mobile Private Land Mobile Maritime Mobile Low Power Radio Service LPRS Dedicated Short Range Communications DSRC 218 219 MHz 220 MHz 700 MHz Guard Bands Air Ground Amateur Aviation Basic Exchange Telephone Broadband Radio Service BRS Citizens Band CB Commercial Operators License Program Educational Broadband Service EBS Family Radio Service FRS General Mobile Radio Industrial Business Radio Pool Intelligent Transportation Systems ITS Instructional Television Fixed ITFS See Educational Broadband Service Lower 700 MHz Medical Implant Communications MICS Microwave Millimeter Wave 70 80 90 GHz Multipoint Distribution MDS MMDS Multi Use Radio Service MURS Offshore Personal Locator Beacons PLB Personal Radio Public Safety Radio Control Radio Service R C and Rural services.

A locator facility may work with the mobile communication facility in identifying the current geographic or other location of the mobile communication facility. A locator facility may for example be used to locate the geographic location of a wireless device through the use of geographically tagged personally identifiable data or personally identifiable data. Geographically tagged personally identifiable data describes personally identifiable data that is linked to a particular location through use of location based services. Personally identifiable data is information that can be used to identify a person uniquely and reliably including but not limited to name address telephone number e mail address and account or other personal identification number as well as any accompanying data linked to the identity of that person e.g. the account data stored by the wireless provider . In addition to or as an alternative to geographic location a locator facility may identify other locations such as proximity to other users proximity to a network location or position relative to other users e.g. in a line .

As described above mobile subscriber information may be stored in an accessible form in a mobile subscriber characteristics database . The information may be accessible directly from a mobile communication facility from the wireless provider or from another user and or handler of the information. In addition the mobile subscriber database may be loaded with information relating to a mobile communication facility a user of the mobile communication facility e.g. a customer of the wireless service provider and a wireless service provider or other source of useful information. The mobile subscriber information may be used in conjunction with a search for information on a mobile communication facility . For example the mobile subscriber information may be used to help better assess the desired search targets of a user using a mobile communication facility. In embodiments the user may perform a search based on key words or disambiguated corrected suggested or other terms as described herein and some or all of the mobile subscriber characteristic information may be used in addition to the key words as a way of refining or customizing the search to the particular user. For example the user s age location time of day past mobile communication facility transactions e.g. phone calls clicks or click throughs may be used to predict what the user is more interested in. In embodiments the information that is predicted as valuable may be listed at the top of the search results they may be the only results produced or they may be highlighted in some way. The mobile subscriber characteristic information may be used in connection with an algorithm facility for example. The mobile subscriber characteristic information may be used in connection with a category filter or other filter used to refine search results according to such information.

By way of another example the mobile subscriber information stored in the mobile subscriber characteristics database may be used in an implicit search as described in further detail herein. The wireless provider may gain information pertaining to the user s location time of day likes and dislikes e.g. through interpretation of other transactions e.g. phone activity or web activity related to the mobile communication facility and the wireless provider may facilitate the downloading of apparently relevant information to the mobile communication facility in anticipation of the user s desire for such information. For example a location facility may locate the mobile communication facility. The location may be associated with the time of day at which the location was obtained. The location information may be associated with the other mobile subscriber characteristic information through a phone number associated with the mobile communication facility. The location may be Harvard Square in Cambridge Mass. The time may be 6 30 p.m. and the user may have called Chinese restaurants ten times over the past two months at about this same time. This may be determined based on previous queries or by history of phone calls that may then be reverse searched to check for relevance to future queries.

With this information the system may make an inference that the user is interested in dinner at a Chinese restaurant and download information pertaining to such in the area of Harvard Square. In addition information pertaining to dinner categories or other results may be presented. In embodiments this collection of user relevant information may be used in connection with sponsor information stored in the sponsor database and some or all of the results presented to the user may be sponsored information. The sponsor information may be the result of a search result auction based on the user relevant information or the sponsor information may be related to local restaurants wherein the sponsored link is a pay per call sponsored link for example.

There are many ways in which the mobile subscriber characteristic information can be used in a mobile communication facility search for information whether it is an explicit implicit or other form of search and several such embodiments are presented in more detail below.

As described above the sponsor database may store sponsor information in an accessible form in the sponsor database to be used in the searching for information presentation of information accessing of information or other activity associated with the mobile communication facility . In embodiments the sponsor information may be used to present syndicated sponsor links advertising content or other information on the mobile communication facility .

A sponsored result may be presented to the user of a mobile communication facility as a result of an auction for advertising space on the mobile communication facility . The auction may be keyword based term based phrase based algorithm based or some other system of associating information a site content and the like with a search query or inquiry. For example the user of a mobile communication facility may conduct a network search by entering a search query and the query or some related form of the query e.g. a disambiguation of the query correction of the query suggestion related to the query may be processed through an auction in which the highest bidder for the auction receives an elevated right to advertise its content. The content may be presented as a sponsored link on a display associated with the mobile communication facility. The sponsored link may be highlighted prioritized or otherwise presented. In embodiments the sponsored information may be presented on a site visited by the mobile communication facility user. For example the user may click on a link other than the sponsored link. Once the website content is displayed on the mobile communication facility information relating to the sponsored link may also be displayed offering another chance for the user to click on the sponsored link.

In embodiments a user of the mobile communication facility may perform a search for information or a search for relevant information may be performed in anticipation of the user desiring such information e.g. an implicit search and included in the results presented may be a sponsored link content or other information. The sponsored content may be the result of an auction e.g. a keyword based auction algorithm based auction location based auction mobile subscriber characteristics based auction or combination auction wherein information such as from the search query is combined with other information such as location or mobile subscriber characteristics and it may be presented and displayed on a display associated with the mobile communication facility in a prioritized manner highlighted manner exclusive manner or presented in some other manner.

In embodiments sponsor information may be presented to a mobile communication facility as the result of an auction. In embodiments sponsor information may be presented as a pay per call link or content. In a pay per call embodiment there may not have been an auction for the right to post the information on the mobile communication facility . The information may have been presented because it appeared relevant or for some other reason. In such situations the user of the mobile communication facility may be presented with a special phone number associated with the sponsor. When the special number is called the receiver of the call e.g. a vendor of goods or services is presented with an option to receive the call and pay a commission to the poster of the information e.g. the wireless service provider or decline the call. In another somewhat similar scenario the vendor may be allowed to accept the first call for free or pay for billed for the call later but have to accept such charges in the future if referrals are desired. The user of the mobile communication facility may store the sponsored or referred phone number in an address book of the mobile communication facility and every time the number is called the wireless service provider may be paid for the referral. In embodiments the referral sponsor fee may go down with use go up with use or remain stable with use. In embodiments the referral sponsor fee may change with time or other parameters. In embodiments a pay per call number is the result of an auction process. Advertising syndication may be segmented by mobile communication facility mobile subscriber characteristics delivery facilities and or parental controls .

In embodiments the carrier rules database includes information relating to search techniques search methodologies locations for searchable content walled garden rules out of garden rules out of network searching rules in network searching rules search result presentation rules sponsor presentation rules sponsor search rules sponsor rules content presentation rules and other information and rules pertaining to the search display ordering and or presentation of information on the mobile communication facility .

Carrier business rules may provide guidance on how for example a search term is to be disambiguated or corrected what search terms should be suggested as a result of an entered or submitted query how results and in what order results should be presented or how sponsors should be selected and or presented. The carrier business rules may provide guidance about when to search in network databases e.g. walled garden content and when to search out of network databases e.g. database through server . For example a wireless provider may want to cause users of mobile communication facilities to order music videos ringtones wallpaper screensavers and the like from an in network database of walled garden content while the wireless provider may want current news to come from an out of network source. The wireless provider may then set these rules and store them in a carrier business rules database . These rules can then be accessed by the wireless provider or optionally from the mobile communication facility or other related facility during the search presentation or ordering or other parameter according to the present invention.

A walled garden database may be associated with a wireless provider and a mobile communication facility according to an aspect of the present invention. The walled garden refers to subset of carrier business rules that determine the type of access to wireless content that a user is permitted. The walled garden may limit the scope of permitted content to a pre defined content set that is determined by the wireless provider . For example a wireless provider may license content from third parties and offer the provider s subscribers a bundled package of the licensed content while restricting access to other content. The wireless provider may direct the content layout authentication royalty tracking and reporting billing quality of service etc. through the provider s carrier business rules or this function may be outsourced to a third party. The walled garden permits a wireless provider to offer its subscribers a suite of content as part of the subscriber s wireless basic account thereby eliminating the need for the subscriber to individually pay for discrete licensed products within the licensed content package. The walled garden restricts the choice of content that is available to subscribers. Typically the wireless provider is compensated for content distribution in a form of revenue split between itself and the licensed content providers.

Related to the walled garden model of content distribution is the gated garden model. In the gated garden the wireless provider may create a virtual toll gate through which third parties may offer their proprietary content to the wireless provider s subscribers. In exchange the wireless provider shares in the revenues derived from its subscribers accessing the third party content. Unlike the walled garden in the gated garden model the wireless provider typically does not assume responsibility for the content or customer service related to problems accessing the content.

The algorithm facility may perform algorithms of all types including algorithms for combining information relating to a search ordering results from a search or displaying results sponsoring results and the like. For example an algorithm facility may include an algorithm to define how to incorporate the mobile subscriber characteristics into a search query entered on the mobile communication facility . The algorithm may for example determine what information to use in combination with a search query what information to use in an implicit search what weight to provide to the various parts of the search e.g. location receives a high weight in an implicit search what sponsors are acceptable how results should be ordered how results should be displayed e.g. highlighted and or determine other parameters related to the search. An algorithm facility may also include sponsorship algorithms algorithms related to auctions algorithms related to pay per click algorithms related to pay per call or other algorithms related to the development of a search as described herein.

The algorithm facility may be a software tool used for evaluating a number of possible solutions based upon a user query. The set of all possible solutions may be called the search space. In general uninformed searching may employ brute force searching or na ve search algorithms for relatively simple direct traversal of the search space. By contrast informed search algorithms may use heuristics to apply knowledge about the structure of the search space during a search. Potential algorithms that may be used in the algorithm facility include but are not limited to the uninformed search informed search tree search list search adversarial search constraint satisfaction genetic search probabilistic search simulated annealing string search taboo search and or federated search.

A parental control facility may be a software based means of restricting access to certain types of user defined objectionable content. The parent control facility may include multi level and or dynamic web filtering technology to filter and block out inappropriate content. The parental control facility may link to other features of the wireless search platform or mobile communication facility . For example the parental control facility may upon blocking objectionable content send an email notification or cell phone alert about inappropriate web browsing instant messaging and chat sessions etc. Comprehensive log reports can summarize a child s activities. The parental control facility may also include the means to control the total time that a user is permitted to use a mobile communication facility or the Internet filter web based email accounts block objectionable pop up ads etc.

A voice recognition facility may be a software component enabling a machine or device e.g. a cellular phone to understand human spoken language and to carry out spoken commands. Typically a human voice is received by the device and converted to analog audio. The analog audio may in turn be converted into a digital format using for example an analog to digital converter which digital data may be interpreted using voice recognition techniques. Generally this is done through the use of a digital database storing a vocabulary of words or syllables coupled with a means of comparing this stored data with the digital voice signals received by the device. The speech patterns of a unique user may be stored on a hard drive locally or remotely or other memory device and may be loaded into memory in whole or in part when the program is run. A comparator may use for example correlation or other discrete Fourier transform or statistical techniques to compare the stored patterns against the output of the analog digital converter.

The capacity of a voice recognition facility such as vocabulary speed and length of digital samples that can be analyzed may be constrained by hardware capabilities of the voice recognition facility such as memory capacity sampling rates and processing speed as well as the complexity of algorithms used for comparisons.

An implicit query facility may automatically generate context sensitive queries based on a user s current activities characteristics and or the user s device characteristics. For example the implicit query facility may retrieve Internet links music files e mails and other materials that relate to an active user s query but which the user did not specifically query. Other data linked to the user s mobile communication facility for example geographic location obtained from the locator facility may be used to initiate an implicit query for stores in the user s general facility that based on the user s previous Internet usage are of likely interest to the user. An implicit query facility may gather and download content onto the mobile communication facility in anticipation of a mobile communication facility user s desire for such information. This technique of providing results in advance of the search query may be used to increase speed of content delivery for example.

A client application interface may be associated with a mobile communication facility . The client application interface may be a software program operating through a processor and operating system on the mobile communication facility and the program may facilitate processes used in the mobile communication facility and or generate information through the display . The client application interface may perform a number of functions associated with the processes and devices as described herein. For example the client application interface may produce the search query entry facility operate in association with a voice activation facility operate in association with transmission and reception circuitry on the mobile communication facility operate in association with mobile host facilities produce a graphical user interface on the mobile communication facility or perform other functions related to the mobile communication facility and or systems and processes as disclosed herein. The client application interface may perform several functions such as producing a graphical user interface on the mobile communication facility. Another function may be expanding a line item e.g. a category a download configuration or option etc. when a cursor or other interface is hovering on the item or otherwise interacting with the item. Another function may be to represent a hierarchy by a visual cue e.g. with an arrow multifaceted arrow plus sign or the like with the sub items appearing below when the visual cue is selected. Another function may be representing a hierarchy as line items with selection scrolling in another screen with the sub items. Another function may be to provide instrumentation to allow for tracking of user clicks just as web pages would be tracked for click patterns. Another function may be using a camera associated with the mobile communication facility to track phone movement as a method for navigating on the screen e.g. scrolling up down left right on a picture map or text to facilitate selection of an item or the like . Another function may be to provide smooth visual transitions e.g. hierarchy screen movements and expanding line item which may provide further visual indication thereby increasing usage and sales. Another function may be to provide tool tips for icons. The tool tips may be presented after a predetermined hover time is achieved or there may be a visual cue near an action icon for example. Another function may be to download suggestions in the background while cached suggestions are already displayed. Another function may be to download suggestions to display next to cached suggestions. Another function may be to cache results e.g. operate similarly to suggestions . Another function may be to operate with preinstalled cached suggestions. Another function may be to perform software update notification wherein the user may have the option to update. Another function may be to present notifications. Such notifications may be phased in to prevent millions of handsets from trying to update at the same time for example. The client application interface may be designed to handle multiple mobile communication facility variations without requiring different versions of the software. The client application interface may generate a gradient shading and or dithering to give color depth without putting a bitmap in the application. This may be provided to reduce the application size to facilitate downloads e.g. increase speed of downloads . Another function may be to provide multi lingual support. Another function may be to allow a user to send to a friend results or an item result e.g. this may apply to any of the delivery facilities presented herein . Another function may be to provide pagination for results to increase page load speed and minimize network costs. Another function may be to search history stored locally to allow quick access from every list screen. The client application interface may be designed to incorporate carrier branding and the carrier branding may be in color and a logo may be presented. Another function may be to provide different data transfer modes to allow for different mobile communication facilities carrier network speeds user data plans or other situations. Another function may be to provide a thin visual cue for background network activity without taking significant screen real estate and allowing for continued interactivity of application. Another function may be to provide a skinnable search application who s arrangement and or appearance may be customized or the client application interface may be locally skinnable. Another function may be to provide a dynamic font selection and display based on information relating to the mobile communication facility . Another function may be to provide a dynamic screen reformatting based on information relating to the mobile communication facility . Another function may be to provide for entry of a general topic with categories and associated results displayed to allow for selection of the rest of the query without having to type in the entire query on a limited Query Entry Facility . Another function may be to provide or associate with a dynamic cache size based on information relating to the mobile communication facility capabilities. Another function may be to pre download information through search experience e.g. downloading results in background before selecting content type . Another function may be to provide high speed and low speed network communication based on changing data usage pattern or on other factors e.g. processing more transactions in the background when the mobile communication facility is associated with a slow network . Another function may be to provide query composition using a combination of suggestions. The client application interface may perform other functions as needed on the mobile communication facility in connection with the functions and facilities outlined herein as well as other conventional functions of the mobile communication facility . Another function may be to use dynamic memory management specifically using more or less memory for previous screens pre fetched information or cached data based on the capabilities of the device and based on the other memory demands of the device such as other applications or content on the phone. Another function may be to automatically update the application with the user s permission. This particular function may be deployed in a phased manner that does not force all devices do not require updating at the same time.

A client application interface may process or cause processes to occur in the background. For example in embodiments results may be presented to the mobile communication facility as they are retrieved without waiting for the entire result set to be retrieved. In embodiments certain results may be presented and displayed while other results are in the process of being presented or displayed. This background processing of results may increase the speed at which some results can be presented to a mobile communication facility . In embodiments certain categories of results may be presented to the mobile communication facility before other categories. For example images may take longer to download process and or collect as compared to ringtones so the category of ringtones or individual ringtones may be presented to the mobile communication facility before or while the image results or image category is presented.

For example a user may provide a query entry Coltrain that is sent through a wireless communication facility so that the query assistance facility may begin. Because the query assistance facility is linked to other data sources as part of the correction process information from the filter algorithm facility may be linked to the query entry to provide more information to be used in the process of producing a more useful search query. In this example the user s filter algorithm facility may use information such as a history of online purchases product names numbers purchase amounts and purchase dates and times. Within the databases associated with the filter algorithm facility there may be a history of many recent purchases of compact discs recorded by the saxophonist John Coltrane. Because the original user query entry Coltrain is not a known word the query assistance facility may predict a correction taking into account user specific data contained in the purchase history of the filter algorithm facility such as that the user seeks information pertaining to Coltrane as opposed to Coal Train or Soul Train etc. In various embodiments or particular user searches within one embodiment the query assistance facility may involve one of these additional data facilities a plurality of the data facilities or none of the data facilities.

It is possible that a user s query entry returns a null result set or an improbable result set. In this case the search facility in conjunction with the mobile communication facility could automatically trigger correction and iteratively cycle through alternative query entries until a non null or higher probability result set is delivered.

In embodiments additional recommendations may be made following a user s query entry based upon the information related to the mobile communication facility. For example mobile subscriber characteristics carrier business rules or sponsor information in conjunction with the query entry may suggest relevant recommendations for the user. The recommendations may be paired with the query entry search results or presented prior to or following the display of the search results.

A user s prior search activities and search results may also be used to create recommendations for the user. Prior search activities may include transactions search queries visits to websites and other acts initiated by the user on the mobile communication facility. The geographic location of the mobile communication facility may foster recommendations including but not limited to sponsor information e.g. products and services in the user s current geographic vicinity. The current time may be used independently or in conjunction with other information to create user recommendations. For example the independent fact that it is noon may create recommendations for restaurants serving lunch. This information may be further filtered by the location of the mobile communication facility to recommend only those restaurants that are in the user s immediate vicinity and further filtered by the subscriber s characteristics to recommend only that subset of restaurants serving lunch in the user s current vicinity that have received high ratings by restaurant patrons with a demographic profile similar to the user s. As with the above restaurant example similar processes for generating meaningful recommendations may be applied to other services and products including transportation food theater sports entertainment movies corporations work banks post offices mail facilities location of and directions to gas stations taxis buses trains cars airports baby sitters and other service and goods providers such as drug stores drive through restaurants bars clubs times of movies and entertainment news and local information.

Various aspects of the assisted query formulation may be activated or de activated under user or provider control. For example a user with a particular search such as a phone number for a particular individual may wish to suppress corrections or suggestions that might be generated with assisted query formulation which might otherwise try to replace a correct but unusual name spelling with more conventional or popular subject matter. Thus in one aspect a user interface for an assisted query formation system may include controls for selectively activating various ones of the tools available to the system. The tools may include for example the recommendations predictions disambiguations categorizations and the like discussed above. In another aspect a service provider such as the wireless provider or mobile communication facility described above may offer selected ones of the tools as value added services that may be provided to select customers such as full service or premium customers or offered on an a la carte basis individually or in packages. In such embodiments query assistance may be requested by a customer using e.g. a web site cellular phone data access or telephone voice access and may be requested on a subscription basis such as recurring monthly or on a daily or per search basis.

In embodiments the methods and systems disclosed herein can be adapted to provide an optimized search based on mobile subscriber characteristics including any of the characteristics described herein and in the documents incorporated by reference herein. Thus these methods and systems may include providing a search function adapted for a mobile device and adapting the search function based on characteristics of the subscriber of the mobile device wherein the subscriber characteristics are derived at least in part from a mobile subscriber data facility that is maintained by a carrier of mobile device services.

In embodiments the adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action related to initiation processing or completion of a search or presentation of search results.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on age. The age adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. For example a mobile communication facility may have an implicit query running so that upon viewing a user interface of the mobile communication facility the user sees results of a query that is automatically pre formulated for the user. The implicit query may be based on the age of the user such as running the query most frequently run by persons of similar age on the same day. For example a teenager might have an implicit query that relates to a music group or movie an adult might have an implicit query that relates to major new headlines and a retired person might have an implicit query that relates to information relevant to financial markets. An age adapted search function may also operate in connection with an active query for example a given query may return results that are age appropriate age filtered age ranked or age disambiguated. For example entering Pink might return results for Pink Floyd if the user is over age 30 while it might return results for the female artist Pink if the user is under 30. A user might be prompted to resolve such an ambiguity or the ambiguity might be automatically resolved for the user. Thus an age adapted search function may be provided for a mobile communication facility. In embodiments the age of the user may be obtained from a mobile subscriber data facility that stores mobile subscriber characteristics .

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on gender. The gender adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. Gender may be determined by reference to a database that stores mobile subscriber characteristics such as a database of a carrier of wireless services. A gender adapted search function may for example inform an implicit query such as presenting results of the searches that are most popular for that gender for that day. Similarly results may be disambiguated by a disambiguation process that is informed by gender. For example the search process might run a query on a database of female oriented sites if the user is female while running a query on male oriented sites if the user is male. Similarly a disambiguation process may filter results based on gender. For example a query such as uprights might return results for vacuum cleaners for a female user while returning results for football kickers for a male user.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on ethnicity. The ethnicity adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. For example an implicit query may generate results that are most popular among members of an ethnic group. A search or query formation process may search for results that relate to a targeted ethnic group. A disambiguation process either upon query formation or upon result retrieval or presentation may disambiguate based on ethnicity. For example a query related to paris might return results for Paris France for a French person while returning results for Paris Hilton for an American. Ethnicity information may be obtained from a database of mobile subscriber characteristics or it might be entered by the user in the user interface.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on religion or cultural affinity. The religion adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. The information may be obtained from a mobile subscriber characteristics database either obtained by a carrier based on application or transactions or inferred based on past behavior or searches of the user. The religion adapted search function may for example run implicit queries that are most popular among members of the same religious affiliation. A religion adapted disambiguation facility may disambiguate queries based on religious affiliation. For example a query for Muhammed might return information about the prophet for members of Islamic religions while it might return information about the boxer for those who don t have religious affiliations.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on area code. The area code adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. For example a user with a given area code could receive implicit query results based on other searches by members of the same area code. Also queries may be disambiguated or results filtered sorted or presented based on area code or other location information . For example a user entering Paris in the 270 area code might receive results for Paris Tenn. a user entering Paris in the 310 area code might receive results for Paris Hilton and a user entering the same word in the 617 area code might receive results for Paris France.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on home address. The address adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. As with the area code adapted search function example above the implicit query disambiguation or results can be varied based on the location of the user s home address information that can be obtained from for example a carrier s database of mobile subscriber characteristics .

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on work address. The work address adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. For example a user may see results of an implicit query that is the same as other queries from the user s employer such as press releases that mention the employer. A disambiguation facility may resolve ambiguity including with help of the user based on work address. For example a user with a work address at a location of General Electric might receive search results on that company when entering the term light in a search engine while a user with a different work address might receive results relating to lighting products. Again the work address information may be obtained from a database of mobile subscriber characteristics such as maintained by a carrier of wireless services.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on billing address. The billing address adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. The billing address information may be obtained from a database of mobile subscriber characteristics such as may be maintained by a carrier of wireless services. The billing address adapted search function may for example present implicit query results similar to those of other users with the same billing address such as queries relevant to the business enterprise that exists at that billing address . Similarly queries may be disambiguated or results filtered sorted presented or routed based on billing address. For example a user with a billing address at a location of a large company may be presented with results that relate to that company while a user with a residential address as the billing address may receive results that are tailored to users in the general area of that location.

In embodiments information about the user s home address area code billing address or other location information may be combined with information about a user s current location as determined by a location facility such as to determine whether a user is in proximity to the user s home or workplace. If so a user may receive query results suitable for one of those environments such as receiving work related information while at work and consumer information while at home . If the user is far from home and work then the user may receive by implicit query or as a result of a search results that are pertinent to travel in the location where the user is located such as hotel car rental and restaurant information. Similarly an away from home user may have an implicit query formed or a partial query disambiguated based on the user s status as a traveler. For example a partial entry for hot might return shopping bargains for a user close to home while it might return hotels for a user who is traveling.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on credit card information. The credit card information adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. The credit card information may be obtained from a database of mobile subscriber characteristics or from a credit card provider. The information may include information relating to current balances credit limits or the like. For example an implicit query may present results based on the available credit balance for a user such as presenting searches or results for expensive goods for a user who has a low balance and high credit limit while presenting searches or results for financial counselors for users who have high balances and low credit limits.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on passwords. The password adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. Thus a mobile search facility may include a password protected search capability such as allowing searches for certain types of content only if the user enters the correct password. For example walled garden content like ringtones or video clips might be available only if the user enters a password that is stored in the database of mobile subscriber characteristics .

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on family information e.g. mother s maiden name number of siblings marital status or the like . The family information adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. For example an implicit search may be running that presents searches or results that are similar to those recently run by family members or friends of the user. A disambiguation process may operate based on family information such as resolving ambiguity in queries based on searches conducted by family members or based on the status of the family. Similarly results may be filtered sorted presented or routed based on family information. For example a search for the term custody might lead to results on child custody for a divorced user while it might reveal information on trust and custody accounts for a married user.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on birthplace. The birthplace adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. Thus an implicit search based on birthplace may include searches or results that are similar to those of other users with the same birthplace or users currently located in proximity to the birthplace. Similarly results may be filtered or queries disambiguated based on birthplace. For example entering derby may retrieve results relating to horse racing for users born in Kentucky while it may retrieve results relating to hats for users born elsewhere.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on driver s license information. The license information adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. License information may include age and address information which may be used as contemplated by the various age and location based search function examples provided herein. License information may also include height weight hair color eye color vision status and the like. For example a user may be presented results that are similar to those of persons of similar appearance.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on employment data. The position adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. The employment data may be obtained from a database of mobile subscriber characteristics such as that maintained by a carrier of wireless services. The employment data may for example indicate a user s status as an officer of a company as an employee of a certain type e.g. sales and marketing supply chain management finance human resources or the like or level e.g. associate manager vice president etc. length of employment or other status. For example an implicit query may present results similar to those for searches run by users holding similar positions in other companies. Similarly a query may be disambiguated or a result retrieved sorted filtered presented or routed based on the user s position. For example a sales manager entering incentive might receive information on promotions related to his employer s products while a human resources manager might receive information relating to employee incentive stock options.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on employer. The employer adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. An employer adapted implicit query may show results similar to those for other searches run by employees of the same employer on the same day or in recent days. An employer adapted disambiguation facility may resolve ambiguities as to the query or results based on the status of the employer and an employer adapted search function may retrieve sort present or route results based on employer characteristics such as obtained from a database of mobile subscriber characteristics . For example a user whose employer is the United States Patent Office might receive information on processing patents in response to a query on application while a Microsoft employee might receive information on software applications in response to the same query.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on annual income. The annual income adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. Annual income may be obtained from a database of mobile subscriber characteristics such as that maintained by a carrier of wireless services. An implicit query may thus present results that are for searches by incomes of similar annual income or searches that are designed to fit the demographic characteristics for that annual income. For example middle income individuals may be presented results for mid sized value based cars while high income individuals may be presented results for luxury items vacations or the like. A disambiguation facility may resolve ambiguities about queries and a search function may retrieve sort present or route results based on annual income. For example a query for boat might run a query or reveal results for commuter boat schedules for individuals of middle income but might run a query or reveal results for yachts for high income individuals.

As with annual income adapted searches in one embodiment the search function is adapted based on income bracket.

Queries may be disambiguated or results retrieved sorted presented or routed based on on line usage amount. For example a heavy on line user entering blog may be sent to the day s most popular blogs while a light user might be presented with more general results describing the blogging phenomenon.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on duration of on line interactions. The duration adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. For example in an implicit query a user with a history of long interactions may be presented with a more complex or extensive result set while a user with a history of short interactions may be presented only with basic information. Similarly a disambiguation facility or a search function that retrieves sorts presents or routes results may do so based on duration of on line interactions. For example a user whose interactions are long may be presented with long articles scientific research or the like while a user with shorter duration interactions may be presented only with news headlines or the like. Similarly for example a short duration user entering football may receive a list of the day s scores while a long duration user may receive articles on football.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on number of on line interactions. The interaction adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. For example in an implicit query a user with a history of many interactions may be presented with more results while a user with few interactions may be presented only with the most pertinent results. Similarly a disambiguation facility or a search function that retrieves sorts presents or routes results may do so based on number or frequency of on line interactions such as indicated by a database of a wireless provider . For example a user whose interactions are many may be presented with long result sets while a user with fewer interactions may be presented only with the most relevant results. Similarly for example a frequent user entering Peter may receive only information relating to uses of that name in the day s news while a less frequent visitor might receive more general results ranging from Peter the Great to Pete Townsend to Peter Rabbit.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on family status and family information. The family information adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. For example an implicit search may present results about dating or relationships to a single user while a married user may receive results relating to child rearing. Similarly a disambiguation process or a search function that retrieves sorts presents or routes results may use family status and family information. For example a single user entering love may receive results relating to dating and relationships while a married user might receive information relating to anniversaries.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on number of children.

A click stream adapted search function may run implicit queries based on past behavior such as running queries for new cars if the user has recently viewed cars with the mobile communications facility . Similarly queries may be disambiguated or results returned sorted presented or routed based on click stream information. For example a user entering a partial URL into a query facility may be directed to a recently visited web site while another user would be directed to a process for resolving ambiguity. Click stream information may be used to infer a wide range of behaviors and characteristics. Thus the other embodiments described herein may take place in combination with deriving one or more mobile subscriber characteristics from click stream information. For example if click stream information shows that a user has visited twenty female oriented sites then the information can be used to infer the gender of the user after which various embodiments of gender adapted search function described herein are enabled.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on device type. The device type adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. For example implicit queries may be run to retrieve results that are suitable for the type of device and filter out other results. For example if a mobile communications facility does not have a video rendering capability then video related results can be filtered out of the process. Similarly queries may be disambiguated or results retrieved sorted presented or routed based on device type. For example a user may be presented with results of walled garden content that is consistent with a device. Upon entering a query a user may receive results that are filtered to include content items that are viewable downloadable for the device and to exclude other content. Device type which may be obtained from the database of mobile subscriber characteristics may also be used to infer other items. For example a particular device may be most popular with a particular age or gender of users in which case the results can be adapted in a manner similar to that described in connection with the age adapted search function described herein.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on device characteristics. The device characteristics adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. The device characteristics may be retrieved from a database of mobile subscriber characteristics such as that maintained by a wireless provider . Characteristics may include the type of device applications running on the device e.g. capability to show photos render video play music or the like . For example implicit queries may be run to retrieve results that are suitable for the particular characteristics of a version of a device and filter out other results. For example if a mobile communications facility does not have a photo imaging capability then photo related results can be filtered out of the process. Similarly queries may be disambiguated or results retrieved sorted presented or routed based on device characteristics. For example a user may be presented with results of walled garden content that is consistent with the correct characteristics of a device. Upon entering a query a user may receive results that are filtered to include content items that are viewable and or downloadable for the characteristics of the device and to exclude other content. For example a user with a device that plays .mp3 files may receive music files upon entering a query for bruce while a user without music capabilities may receive web search results related to Bruce Springsteen. Device characteristics which may be obtained from the database of mobile subscriber characteristics may also be used to infer other items. For example particular device characteristics may be most popular with a particular age of user or gender in which case the results can be adapted in a manner similar to that described in connection with the age adapted search function described herein.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on usage patterns including those based on location time of day or other variables . The usage pattern adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. For example if a user frequently searches for restaurants on weekends then an implicit query may run restaurant searches on weekends. Similarly the same query e.g. rest may return restaurant related results on weekends while revealing results related to restructured text during work hours particularly if the usage pattern indicates that the user is a software engineer . Thus a disambiguation process or a search function to retrieve sort present or route results may use usage patterns to accomplish those functions. Usage patterns may be obtained from a database of mobile subscriber characteristics such as that maintained by a wireless provider . A wide range of usage patterns may be used to assist with formation of queries implicit and explicit and with retrieval and organization of results. The algorithm facility may include one or more modules or engines suitable for analyzing usage patterns to assist with such functions. For example an algorithm facility may analyze usage patterns based on time of day day of week day of month day of year work day patterns holiday patterns time of hour patterns surrounding transactions patterns surrounding incoming and outgoing phone calls patterns of clicks and clickthroughs patterns of communications e.g. Internet email and chat and any other patterns that can be discerned from data that is collected by a wireless provider or Internet service provider. Usage patterns may be analyzed using various predictive algorithms such as regression techniques least squares and the like neural net algorithms learning engines random walks Monte Carlo simulations and others. For example a usage pattern may indicate that a user has made many work related phone calls during a holiday such as by determining that the user was located at work and making calls all day . Such a user may be presented preferably with content that is related to a vacation such as showing hotels rental cars or flight promotions in an implicit query or preferentially presenting such items in response to explicit queries including disambiguating partial queries or ambiguous queries . For example such a user might receive hotel information in response to entering the partial query hot while another user receives weather information. In one such embodiment the search function is adapted based on phone usage. The phone usage adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on device and or subscriber unique identifiers. The identifier adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. Here as with usage pattern adapted search functions the identifier may be used to identify the user in the search facility allowing targeted queries disambiguation and results.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on content viewing history. The viewing history adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. Viewing history may be obtained by a local facility on the mobile communication facility such as a database or cache on a cellular phone or it may be obtained at a central facility such as an Internet server or a central office for phone services. Such data may be retrieved for example from a database of mobile subscriber characteristics . Viewing history may be analyzed in embodiments by an algorithm facility such as to infer behavior based on content viewing patterns. In embodiments viewing history may include content viewed using a mobile communication facility . In other embodiments viewing history may include history with respect to other content provided by the same entity that is the wireless provider . For example such a provider may provide television content via DSL or cable Internet content to a home or other content. Viewing histories for all such content may be analyzed to assist with improving search function including assisting with development of implicit queries resolving ambiguities with explicit queries and retrieving sorting filtering presenting and routing search results. For example if a database of mobile subscriber characteristics shows that a particular viewer watched the first six episodes of 24 but missed the seventh episode then a search for the element 24 may retrieve online sources for the seventh episode while another user entering a similar query might receive general information about the show or information about 24 hour fitness centers. Viewing history should be understood to encompass all types of interactions with content such as downloading listening clicking through sampling or the like including all types of content such as text data music audio sound files video broadcast content and the like.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on content presented for viewed by not viewed by user. The declined content adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. Information about declined content may be obtained from a database of mobile subscriber characteristics such as that maintained by a wireless provider which may also be a provider of various other content sources that have been presented and declined such as by explicitly declining an option to view content or by implicitly declining ignoring the content such as upon repeated opportunities to view it . Wireless providers frequently have access to such viewing histories because the same carriers also provide television Internet and other content sources. Declined content can be analyzed with an algorithm facility to assist with forming implicit queries resolving explicit queries and with retrieving sorting filtering presenting and routing results. For example if a user has consistently declined or failed to view music oriented programming content whether on a cellular phone TV or Internet then a query for the term U2 might return information on Soviet era spy planes notwithstanding that for other users such a query would return content related to the rock group U2. As in analysis of usage patterns a wide range of algorithms including learning algorithms regression analyses neural nets and the like may be used to understand patterns in declined content that assist with handling queries and results.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on content and programs downloaded. The download history adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search.

Such content and programs may be analyzed and used in the manner described above for usage pattern adapted search functions . In one such embodiment the search function is adapted based on videos music and audio listened to and or downloaded. Again the content action adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. In another such embodiment the search function is adapted based on television watched. The television viewing adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. In another such embodiment the search function is adapted based on television subscriptions. The subscription adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. In one such embodiment the search function is adapted based on timing and duration of viewing downloading. The view download timing and duration adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search.

In embodiments the search facility may be a high volume scalable redundant search engine specifically tuned for mobile content. The engine may be implemented in Java and deployed in a two tier architecture in which the presentation logic runs on web servers which format the results returned by passing the actual search requests off to search servers. Search servers may use proprietary algorithms that blend results from full text metadata indices with results from 3rd party partner APIs. The search engine may be accessed via a query API. A query is a set of words possibly restricted to specific fields coupled with restrictions on content type category and format.

In embodiments the search facility may use a ranking algorithm which incorporates a number of features including one or more of full text relevance using e.g. term frequency inverse document frequency or TFIDF or variants and enhancements thereto word order and proximity scores number of words matching scores with thresholds popularity overall and within demographic editorial boosts and field by field boosts. The wireless provider may control the editorial boosts.

In embodiments the search facility may be optimized for mobile input methods by using for example partial word matching suggestions and mobile communication facility compatibility. Partial word matching coupled with popularity scoring may provide the best possible results for the user. Partial word matching may also work for multiple word phrases. Thus a search for ro st may suggest results matching Rolling Stones . A suggestion is a recommended search string. For example for the query string piz a suggestion could be pizza . Suggestions may permit users to enter the wanted search terms with the fewest number of characters. Suggestions may be provided by the engine and cached locally for performance enhancement.

In embodiments the mobile communication facility may customize the search engine results to the capabilities of the mobile communication facility . For example the search engine may not present search results that are inappropriate for the device e.g. a ringtone that is incompatible . When compatibility information cannot be determined results that require particular hardware or software may receive lower rankings or scores. The recommendation engine may also or instead use the device type as one of the attributes when calculating recommendations.

In embodiments content may be segregated such that the search facility may take contextual queues based on where the user enters the search experience. For example users entering search from the ringtone area may receive ringtone restricted results. In addition the wireless provider may have multiple content partners and may wish to restrict the search to certain content partners in certain situations. For example the wireless provider may wish to provide a search box in an entertainment section which only searches content from a specific partner where a search box in the travel section would search different content. The search facility may limit results to a specific partner or set of partners.

In embodiments discovery services may be provided to end users in order to build a content index. This index may be populated by means of an explicit data feed of content elements or by spidering a Web or WAP site containing the metadata about the content. A data feed may be provided with a regularly scheduled transfer of data from the wireless provider . Feeds may consist of content taxonomy and transaction history data. Content may include one record per item including metadata about handset compatibility previews price artists size purchase location etc. Taxonomy may include a description of the categorization system used for the data elements. Sometimes content and taxonomy data may be distributed separately sometimes they may be intermingled into one data file. Transaction History may include the data associating a unique subscriber with the content elements he or she has interacted with. The content and taxonomy feeds may be processed to extract the metadata associated with each element. From this metadata a search index may be built. Data Feeds may be scheduled to run at predefined times or may be triggered upon request. If the wireless provider supplies content in multiple languages each collection of language specific content may be set up as a separate data feed. A content data feed may be a single XML or CSV file containing one record per item.

In embodiments for carriers that create an editorial categorization of items a content data feed may be blended with a taxonomy data feed. A taxonomy data feed may describe the specific taxonomy of the wireless provider content For example the ring tone for Britney Spears Oops I did it again might exist in the Pop and Female Vocalists categories. A taxonomy feed may consist of a single XML or CSV file.

In embodiments the transaction history data may enumerate specific behavior for specific users. This may be used to compute popularity information and be used as an input to the recommendation engine. This data feed may be used whether or not the content index is built via regular data feeds or by spidering. A common format for this information is the Apache Log Format.

In embodiments full text relevance may compute a TFIDF metric in which the frequency of words within the overall item set influences the relevancy score. In embodiments stop words may be used to improve search result relevancy. Stop Words may be words which do not contribute to the overall ranking of a document and are not searched or not used in query formulation. The search facility that does not use stop words explicitly may nonetheless specify certain words that influence relevance less than others. In embodiments the search facility may use query analysis to identify specific verticals with specific queries in certain contexts. Thus it may be possible for a search for ice cream to prefer local listing results to general web pages.

In one embodiment the search function is adapted based on services purchased from a carrier e.g. phone lines television packages wireless services DSL cable services broadband services data services and other services . The carrier services adapted search function may be an implicit query an active query a disambiguation action a retrieval function a filtering function a presentation function a routing function or another function or action relating to the initiation processing or completion of a search. Such information may be retrieved from a database of mobile subscriber characteristics such as that stored by a wireless provider who may also be a provider of various other services. The other services may be analyzed such as by an algorithm facility to infer information about a user s intent when executing a search function including for presenting implicit queries resolving ambiguous queries or retrieving sorting filtering presenting or routing results. For example if a user has DSL has purchased a premium sports television package and has bookmarked sports related sites then the user may be presented with implicit queries that retrieve sports results for that day. Similarly upon entering Jason such a user might receive results on the Red Sox or Jason Varitek while another user might receive information about the Friday the 13th series of movies or the JASON foundation. Again the algorithm facility may use a wide range of techniques including simple category based inferences learning algorithms neural nets regression analysis and other statistical techniques or the like to draw inferences about how purchasing various services relates to query formation. Such techniques may include collaborative filtering techniques as described elsewhere herein and in the documents incorporated by reference herein for determining how a user s preferences align with other users having similar characteristics.

As with the voice information the web interaction data may be manipulated and predictions of future behavior likes and dislikes may be made. In the monitoring of internet behavior in garden and out of garden activities may be tracked.

Location information and time of day information may also be tracked and stored in a location information database . A with the voice information and the web interaction information the location and time of day information may also be used by the personal filter .

User information such as personal information or information used to set up the user account with the wireless provider may be kept in a database that is accessible by the personal filter .

The personal filter may receive a search query from a mobile communication facility extract information from each of the databases and process all of the information through an optimization algorithm and perform an optimized search for results. Likewise results may be obtained and the personal filter may be used to process the results along with the other mobile communication related information and produce filtered results to the mobile communication facility .

While the databases and are illustrated as separate databases it should be understood that these may be combined into one or more databases such as a relational database. While the personal filter is illustrated as residing in the wireless provider domain it should be understood that the personal filter may reside elsewhere including on the mobile communication facility or in another related facility.

In the following discussion the term deck is generally used to refer to in garden content or optionally a discrete group of explicitly interrelated content items while mobile web generally refers to WAP sites and web generally refer to open web search results. Thus an effort is made in the following description to distinguish between in garden content general mobile device content and general web content. However it will be appreciated that these distinctions are not always exclusive and not rigidly followed in the following discussion so the context may appropriately suggest or require a narrower or broader meaning to any of these terms.

As indicated by the navigation facility the category Deck has been selected and expanded to reveal sub categories related to the category Deck. Again the user can select the sub category in this embodiment Music is selected to drill down into further categories or results.

In embodiments results may be presented to the mobile communication facility as they are retrieved without waiting for the entire result set to be retrieved. In embodiments certain results may be presented and displayed while other results are in the process of being presented or displayed This background processing of results may increase the speed at which some results can be presented to a mobile communication facility . In embodiments certain categories of results may be presented to the mobile communication facility before other categories. For example images may take longer to download process and or collect as compared to ringtones so the category of ringtones or individual ringtones may be presented to the mobile communication facility before or while the image results or image category is being locally loaded for presentation.

As described in connection with the mobile search host facility may include an algorithm facility filter e.g. a collaborative filter or personal filter . The personal filter may be used in conjunction with a search query entered and transmitted from the mobile communication facility along with information from one of the associated databases and or its location information. The personal filter may use an algorithm that predicts the desired results based on information collected from other searchers e.g. collaborative filtering as well information relating to the user e.g. mobile subscriber characteristic information from database or location information .

An implicit search scenario associated with the illustration of could be as follows. The person is walking down the street at 7 00 p.m. The location of the mobile communication facility is assessed using a GPS system i.e. in association with the location facility . The location is then stored. An implicit search is initiated either because it is the time of day for the periodic implicit search because user habits indicate the user is going to be looking for results soon because there are advertisers interested in pushing an advertisement there is a local sale there is an activity nearby or there are other temporal activity based or other reasons to initiate the implicit search. Once the search is initiated the stored location information may be transmitted to a mobile search host facility. The mobile host search facility may also collect information from other associated sources e.g. the mobile subscriber characteristics database the sponsor information database carrier rules . The mobile search host facility is now prepared to perform a search based on the personal filter in the mobile search host facility in conjunction with the user s location time of day and or other information relating to the several data sources available to the mobile search host facility e.g. the mobile subscriber characteristics database the sponsor data base the content the carrier rules and the open web content . All of the information may indicate that this is the general time when the user eats dinner so the mobile search host facility may provide results to the mobile communication facility that pertain to dinner. In these results a sponsor may have participated in a search marketing auction in an attempt to get his information onto the user s mobile communication facility . For example a restaurant located in a building C may be the high bidder on a keyword auction related to dinners within five miles of another building C where the user is located so the information the restaurant wanted sponsored and displayed on the mobile communication facility will be displayed if the user interacts with the restaurant information presented. The information may not be presented until the user decides to look at search results which may not ever happen. If the user does not interact with the sponsored result that was downloaded to the mobile communication facility the sponsor may or may not have to pay a fee to the wireless provider for the sponsored content. If the user does interact with the restaurant information that was downloaded on the mobile communication facility the restaurant may or may not have to pay a fee to the wireless provider .

To continue with this implicit search scenario the user may enter into a results mode or search mode on the mobile communication facility . In a results mode results may appear without the need for a search. In this mode the user may simply be presented with information that he may be interested in given all of the prior information that is known about him e.g. location time of day and mobile subscriber information . In a search mode the user may enter a search query and if there is a relationship between the search query and the previously downloaded results the previously downloaded results may be presented. The user may perceive this as a very fast search or a high bandwidth connection because the search results are presented from local memory.

The previously downloaded results presented may include a sponsored link from the restaurant and the user may activate the sponsored link e.g. by clicking on it . Once activated or clicked or interacted with the user may be presented with information relating to the restaurant. The information may include contact information e.g. phone address email URL as well as a description of the restaurant. The user may be presented with a general section of the restaurant s website or a space tailored for the user . For example the restaurant may present users with a coupon or other sale if they arrive at the restaurant within a predetermined time. Knowing they are in the area and knowing the volume of restaurant traffic the restaurant may be able to offer a more targeted sale offer.

Likewise the bookstore in a building B may want to advertise to the user because he is in the area and has some history of searching amazon.com and the like. The restaurant may have signed up to participate in an auction for mobile communication facility advertising space relating to people in the area of the building B within the hours the store is open where the people have a history of activities related to the purchase of books e.g. searching amazon.com purchasing books on line or are frequent travelers .

While embodiments involving implicit searching have been described in connection with it will be appreciated that the same or similar techniques may be applied to explicit searches. For example the user may be in the area of an office building A and may be looking for the office building A. The user may enter a search query with the name of the office building B and the name of the office building may be combined with the user s location and time of day to better target search results for the user.

An explicit search scenario associated with the illustration of could be as follows. The person is walking down the street at 7 00 p.m. The location of the mobile communication facility is assessed using a GPS system i.e. in association with the location facility . The location is then stored. An explicit search is initiated by the user . Once the search is initiated the stored location information may be transmitted to a mobile search host facility. The mobile host search facility may also collect information from other associated sources e.g. the mobile subscriber characteristics database the sponsor information database or carrier rules . The mobile search host facility is now prepared to perform a search based on the personal filter in the mobile search host facility in conjunction with the user s location time of day and other information relating to the several data sources available to the mobile search host facility e.g. the mobile subscriber characteristics database the sponsor data base the content the carrier rules and the open web content . The search may be performed in conjunction with the personal filter and other relevant filtering information to obtain results. In these results a sponsor may have participated in a search marketing auction in an attempt to get his information onto the user s mobile communication facility . For example the restaurant located in a building C may be the high bidder on a keyword auction related to dinners within five miles of the building C so the information the restaurant wanted sponsored and displayed on the mobile communication facility will be displayed if the user interacts with the restaurant information presented. If the user does not interact with the sponsored result that was downloaded to the mobile communication facility the sponsor may or may not have to pay a fee to the wireless provider for the right to post. If the user does interact with the restaurant information that was downloaded on the mobile communication facility the restaurant may or may not have to pay a fee to the wireless provider .

The downloaded results presented may include a sponsored link from the restaurant and the user may activate the sponsored link e.g. by clicking on it . Once activated or clicked or interacted with the link may present the user with information relating to the restaurant. The information may include contact information e.g. phone address email URL as well as a description of the restaurant. In one embodiment the information may include a form or active control such as a button for making reservations. The user may be presented with a general section of the restaurant s website or a space tailored for the user . For example the restaurant may present the user with a coupon or other sale if he or she arrives at the restaurant within a predetermined time. Knowing they are in the area and knowing the volume of restaurant traffic the restaurant may be able to offer a more targeted sale offer.

Likewise the bookstore in a building B may want to advertise to the user because he is in the area and has some history of searching amazon.com and the like. The restaurant may have signed up to participate in an auction for mobile communication facility advertising space relating to people in the area of the building B within the hours the store is open where the people have a history of activities related to the purchase of books e.g. searching amazon.com purchasing books on line is a frequent traveler .

In embodiments search results are presented to the user on the mobile communication facility that are targeted to the user based on information relating to the user the mobile communication facility the location and or other information as described herein in conjunction with a personal filter. In embodiments the information is also used to better target advertising and sponsored advertisements may be provided to the mobile communication facility through a pay for auction advertisement scheme. Such a scheme could be similar to the desktop featured Google AdWords and AdSense by Google Inc. of Mountain View Calif.

By way of another example made in connection with the user may receive a search result that includes a pay per call link where the vendor associated with the call typically the company being called pays a fee when receiving a call through the pay per call number. For example the user may search for results related to flowers and receive back a phone number and possibly other contact information for the flower shop in building D. The link may have been provided as a result of processing a search through a process involving a personal filter in conjunction with information relating to the user the mobile communication facility and or the mobile subscriber characteristic information as indicated in the implicit search example and the explicit search example illustrated in connection with . Once the user activates the phone number for the flower shop the flower shop may be able to receive the call for a fee or reject the call.

In embodiments of the present invention methods and systems may include presenting a link in a user interface of a mobile communication device where the link is configured to link to a commercial item that is available via a computer network thus enabling a party to sponsor the link. The link may be to an item of goods or services for sale to a promotion to a content item to an advertisement or to other material of a commercial provider such as a vendor of goods or services. The link may for example be to an item on an electronic commerce site to an auction site to a reverse auction site to a news site to an information site or to other content on a computer network such as web content content located on other networks or the like. The link may include or be associated with various e commerce features such as those enabling single click purchasing bidding targeted advertising instant purchasing e.g. buy it now tracking of clicks or transactions tracking of referrals affiliate program features or the like. In embodiments the link is a sponsored link that is presented to a user on the user interface of a mobile communication facility such as a cell phone. The sponsored link may be presented in association with an implicit query and may be related to such a query . The sponsored link may be presented in response to entering an explicit query or partial entry of such a query . The sponsored link may be presented upon making of a telephone call or other action of a user of the mobile communication facility . The sponsored link may be presented upon retrieval of results sorting of results filtering of results presentation of results or routing of results such as in response to a search function that is executed in response to a query.

In embodiments the right to sponsor a link is obtained via a bidding process among a plurality of candidate sponsors. The bidding process may be automated whereby a bid or a reserve bid reserve price or the like is automatically compared to other bids made by other candidate sponsors for a link in an auction format. In other embodiments bids need only meet a required price in order to be accepted. An algorithm facility may determine what link or links relate to winning bids for sponsoring particular links. Bids can be for presenting links at a particular position in the user interface at a particular point in a navigation sequence such as on a home page on a search screen after a call has been made after a transaction has been executed after navigation to a particular screen upon presentation of an implicit query upon entry of an explicit query upon retrieval of results upon routing of results and or upon consummation of a transaction or the like . Bids can be made for associating a link with particular content such as particular forms of queries particular results or particular content items. For example a sponsor who sells golf equipment might bid to sponsor links whenever an implicit or explicit query uses the terms golf tee or par while a sponsor who sells video content might seek to sponsor links when a query uses the terms movie film cinema or show. In embodiments a bidding process may occur in close proximity in time to the presentation of the link.

In certain embodiments the right to sponsor the link is obtained via an auction which may be an online auction.

In embodiments a link may be associated with a disambiguated version of a query so that a link appears only after the relevancy of a query has been assessed.

In embodiments a sponsored link may be associated with a result that is retrieved via a search that is executed using the mobile communication device . For example a link for a camera vendor may appear only when one of the highest ranked search results uses the words digital camera. 

In embodiments the sponsored link may be associated with the sorting of results that are retrieved via a search function that is executed using the mobile communication device. For example a link may be sponsored including after a bidding process only if associated results are ranked sufficiently high after they are sorted such as being sorted as a result of a ranking or disambiguation process .

In embodiments a sponsored link may be associated with the filtering of results that are retrieved via a search function that is executed using the mobile communication device. For example the sponsored link may only appear after certain types of results have been filtered out. For example a sponsor of travel to Paris France might bid to sponsor a link only in situations where results relating to Paris Hilton have been filtered out before results are presented to the user.

In embodiments a sponsored link may be associated with the presentation of results that are retrieved via a search function that is executed using the mobile communication device. For example if certain results are modified or filtered such as based on the capability of a particular device to present certain content a sponsored link may be sponsored only for situations where relevant results can be presented on the mobile communications facility. For example a sponsor may bid to sponsor links to instructional videos for yoga but only for presentation on devices that are capable of rendering sample video.

In embodiments a sponsored link may be associated with the routing of results that are retrieved via a search function that is executed using the mobile communication device. For example if an algorithm facility includes rules for routing certain types of results a sponsored link may be associated with the execution of such rules. For example rules related to parental controls may route content or messages to parents if children appear to be attempting to access inappropriate content. A sponsored link may allow a provider of parental control software or services to present a link that is associated with the routed results.

In embodiments a link may be provided to a commercial item of a party who has not yet sponsored the link. The party may then be offered the opportunity to sponsor the continued presentation of the link. In embodiments the offer to continue to sponsor the link may be presented to a commercial entity contemporaneously with or upon a user s execution of the link. In embodiments such an offer may include an invitation for the commercial entity to participate in an auction or bidding process for continued sponsorship of the link or for sponsorship of at least one additional link.

In embodiments the link to a commercial entity may include a phone number for a provider of the commercial item. In embodiments the phone number may be a dedicated phone number which when called by a user conveys an intermediate message to the commercial entity that includes an offer to continue the link in exchange for an agreement by the commercial entity to pay some consideration which may be a sponsored link basis an auction basis a pay per call basis or the like.

In embodiments a generalized process may be used for disambiguating a user query entry by pairing the query information with at least one element from the mobile subscriber characteristics database . Once the user submits a query entry via the mobile communication facility the query is wirelessly routed to the wireless communication facility and then to the wireless provider . The wireless provider may then abstract data stored in the mobile subscriber characteristics database that is relevant to the user query entry . Relevance may be based upon semantic similarities temporal factors and geographic and or demographic congruence between the substance of the query entry and that found in the mobile subscriber characteristics database . Once this information is linked the disambiguation facility may carry out operations to elucidate the probable best meaning of the user s query entry and route the result s back through the wireless provider and wireless communication facility to the mobile communication facility for display to the user.

Representative elements that may be stored within the mobile subscriber characteristics database include location personal information relating to a user web interactions email interactions messaging interactions billing history payment history typical bill amount time of day duration of on line interactions number of on line interactions family status occupation transactions previous search queries entered history of locations phone number device identifier type of content previously downloaded content previously viewed and sites visited.

Similarly the query entry may be disambiguated based upon characteristics of the user s mobile communication facility e.g. unique phone number device identifier or other unique identifier information stored within the mobile communication facility e.g. information stored in the memory of the device or information stored on a database associated with a server.

In embodiments mobile search host facilities may be used for providing mobile communications facility users additional relevant result set s based upon a query entry . For example the mobile communication facility may have a cache of memory wherein salient information is stored such as aspects of the mobile communication facility the user s profile and a user behavioral history e.g. phone calls websites visited search queries frequency of queries frequency of downloading content rate changes in the frequency of events and frequency of purchases .

This information may be automatically refreshed and transferred at set temporal intervals from the mobile communication facility to the wireless communication facility and then on to either the user s wireless provider or directly to the mobile search host facilities . Within the mobile search host facilities the query content may be filtered by an algorithm facility that scrutinizes the query content for the purpose of providing the user additional suggestions in the result set s . For example the frequency of terms used by the user in the query entry may be used by the algorithm facility to suggest related results based upon similar frequency indexing of key words or upon the popularity of query terms and results. As the user amends his query entry the cache may implicitly transfer the content to the mobile search host facilities for real time processing within the disambiguation facility search facility or other facility within the mobile host search facilities .

Additional facilities within the mobile search host facilities may be used to add meaningfulness to the query entry . For example the disambiguation facility may categorize the query entry based upon key words word frequency and or word combinations thereby enabling the resulting categories such as title artist and yellow page type categories. Carrier business rules parental controls and a sponsorship facility may also be used to generate suggestions for these and related search query and or result set s .

An interactive process between the mobile communication facility and the disambiguation step may be used for unambiguous query formation . Once a user submits a query entry to the mobile communication facility a process of correction may be necessary or helpful for unambiguous query formation that is sufficient to yield intelligible and useful result set s . As part of the correction process information specific to the type of mobile communication facility may be used for example if the device has unique delivery capabilities the query may need correction in order to derive a result set compatible with these capabilities. Information stored in the mobile subscriber characteristics database or parental controls facility may also be integral to the correction process. In embodiments the search engine may automatically suggest corrections for common misspellings including those which are unique to the mobile experience e.g. 2nite 

A user s query entry may return a null result set or an improbable results set. In this case the search facility in conjunction with the mobile communication facility could automatically trigger correction and iteratively cycle through alternative query entries until a non null or higher probability result set is delivered.

In embodiments items which have been more recently added or updated may receive a ranking priority indicative of their freshness.

In embodiments additional recommendations may be made following a user s query entry based upon the information related to the mobile communication facility . For example mobile subscriber characteristics carrier business rules or sponsor information in conjunction with the query entry may suggest relevant recommendations for the user. The recommendations may be paired with the query entry search results or presented prior to or following the display of the search results.

A user s prior search activities and search results may also be used to create recommendations for the user. Prior search activities may include transactions search queries visits to websites phone calls and or other acts initiated by the user on the mobile communication facility . The geographic location of the mobile communication facility may foster recommendations including but not limited to sponsor information e.g. products and services in the user s current geographic vicinity. The current time may be used independently or in conjunction with other information to create user recommendations. For example the independent fact that it is noon may create recommendations for restaurants serving lunch. This information may be further filtered by the location of the mobile communication facility to recommend only those restaurants that are in the user s immediate vicinity and it may be further filtered by the subscriber s characteristics to recommend only that subset of restaurants serving lunch in the user s current vicinity that have received high ratings by restaurant patrons with a demographic profile similar to the user s. As with the above restaurant example similar processes for generating meaningful recommendations may be applied to other services and products including transportation navigation taxis buses trains cars airports etc. food and drink groceries drive through restaurants bars etc. entertainment theater sports movies clubs etc. business corporations workplaces banks post offices and other mailing or shipping facilities etc. consumer needs gas stations drug or clothing stores baby sitters parking etc. and information specific to the locale directions locations starting times news etc. 

In embodiments classifications of search categories may be presented that relate to the search query on a display associated with the mobile communication facility .

In embodiments a query entry may be mapped to a taxonomy of query categories and classification schema e.g. the yellow pages phone book taxonomy .

In embodiments results may be retrieved based on submitting a query entry in conjunction with information relating to the mobile communication facility . This information may include the mobile subscriber characteristics carrier business rules and sponsor information. The additional information stored in these databases may form search parameters that limit the search query and the display of result set s by omitting information prioritizing information e.g. presenting sponsor links prior to all others highlighting a subset of the search result set or ordering the display of information based upon a sponsor auction i.e. highest bidder presented first . In the case of the sponsor auction sponsors may bid on keywords that they would like to be associated with their products services and links thereto.

In embodiments results may be ordered in relation to the query entry based at least in part on information relating to the mobile communication facility . This information may include mobile subscriber characteristics a search algorithm facility parental controls carrier business rules and or sponsor information. Ordering results related to a query entry based on sponsor information may be done by associating sponsors with key words used in query entries and or associating query entries with sponsor content. When a query entry matches a sponsor s keyword s or content that sponsor s information may be prioritized in the search result display highlighted or otherwise given superiority over other content related to the query entry . Association of key words with sponsors may occur through an auction in which bidders compete for sole association with keywords or for a shared frequency of keyword association e.g. every other occurrence of a keyword . Furthermore the auction process could include bidding to determine the size of the resulting sponsor content display e.g. expressed as a percentage of the user s total display space on the mobile communication facility and the addition of multimedia content to the results display such as adding graphics audio or a video stream.

Query results may also be ordered at least in part based on the capabilities of the mobile communication facility wherein the capability is an audio visual processing or screen capability.

In embodiments pay per click and pay per call program integration onto mobile communication facilities may enable a wireless provider to deliver targeted keyword based ads and content to mobile users searching for specific goods and services at the precise moment a user expresses a need. Pay per click advertising often referred to as search engine marketing or keyword advertising operates on the principle of pay for performance through this channel advertisers may pay only for the clicks or web site visits they receive through their text based advertisement. Businesses may place their ads for specific search phrases or keywords that best describe their company or products. Advertisers generally use several different keywords for their ads trying to maximize the number of searches for which they will appear e.g. Sony may try to advertise for the search phrases DVD player Television Mobile phone etc. . Search engine marketing operates through a real time auction based pricing model in which advertisers bid to appear for their relevant keywords. The advertiser s position or rank in the paid listings is determined by the bid price with the top position going to the highest bidder. Given the wide range of popularity for keywords competition varies drastically for keywords bid prices for the most popular keywords are driven up as they attract more advertisers. Keyword competition may be driven by several factors including a product s average sale price customer acquisition cost and number of competitors. Advertisers may create their own ads through a self service or sales assisted web interface. Examples of web based pay per click products include Google AdWords Yahoo Search Marketing MIVA and Lycos InSite AdBuyer. When creating an ad the advertiser may supply information such as an ad title URL description and or website URL. Pay Per Call advertising combines search functionality with live on the phone interaction resulting in a powerful marketing opportunity for local businesses.

Pay per call advertising operates on the same principle as pay per click in that advertisers bid to appear in specific search results or directory categories and are charged only when a consumer who sees their ad places a call to the advertiser s listed phone number a system generated toll free number that redirects the user to the company s true number . An advertiser s position in the list of paid results is determined by the bid amount with the highest bid yielding the top position. Unlike traditional search advertising however Pay per call advertising may be able to tap into the uniquely high level of user intent by connecting qualified mobile consumers directly with businesses at the exact moment they are searching for specific goods and services. Pay per call listings may be presented above traditional directory or yellow pages results.

In embodiments third party pay per call inventory may be supplied to in the form of XML feeds each of which returns specific results data on a per query basis about the keyword match the advertiser and ad information bid price and geographic filter settings. This information may then be parsed and packaged in a result set stacked on top of natural yellow page listings. A yield optimization algorithm may be used to ensure that each query is answered with a relevant and monetizable set of paid content. The yield optimization algorithm considers several variables to determine placement and rank simultaneously including relevancy geography click through call through rate and bid price. Relevancy may be in part determined by the query string including keyword location and ultimately demographic behavioral factors that may be matched to information supplied in the advertisement and or the assigned business categories. For geography it may be possible to present only those businesses serving the respective geographical areas zip code city state as specified by the advertiser. The algorithm for the click through call through rate may also consider the frequency with which users actually place the call to the advertiser in determining best query match. Bid price refers to the placement and rank of a given advertisement as determined in part by the amount paid by the advertiser.

In embodiments advertisers may create and manage their mobile search pay per click advertising campaigns through a user interface that permits ad creation selection of keywords to associate with the ad s and or service area s in which to make the ad accessible and place a bid for the service. For example the advertiser may begin by entering the ad creative content including the ad title a Landing page URL address page to which user will be brought not displayed the Display URL address address to be displayed in ad and an ad description 1 2 lines for display in ad . The advertiser may then enter keywords search phrases for which the ad should appear. There may be several ways of entering the keywords including manual entry the advertiser may type copy the keywords manually use of a keyword suggestion tool thesaurus advertisers can view synonyms or related keywords along with estimated monthly search volume and top bids and or bulk upload advertisers may upload keywords in bulk when dealing with a high volume of keywords . Finally the advertiser may wish that the ad s target only a subset of users such as only users residing in a particular geographic region meeting a set of demographic user characteristics and or users with a particular mobile communication facility .

Once an advertiser has selected one or more of the above criteria the advertiser may then set a specific or maximum price that they are willing to pay for a click through to their web site. Bids may be for each keyword associated with a given ad or any other criterion or combination of criteria used by the advertiser to target the placement of their ad s . Bids may be placed individually by keyword or an advertiser can apply one bid price across all new keywords for the new ad. Advertisers will also be able to view the top bids for each keyword directly through the user interface in order to gauge keyword competition and to ensure their ad appears in the desired position. The bidding process may also include Auto Bid functionality that allows the platform to manage an advertiser s bids directly. For instance by specifying the desired position for the ad and a maximum amount that an advertiser is willing to pay for each click the advertiser may allow the system to monitor the competitive landscape and adjust the advertiser s bids to pay only the minimum that is required to secure the desired spot up to but not exceeding the specified maximum .

In embodiments advertisers may create and manage their mobile search pay per call advertising campaigns through a user interface that permits ad creation selection of details to associate with the ad s and or service area s in which to make the ad accessible and place a bid for the service. The advertiser may begin by entering the general contact information for the business including the business name mailing contact address phone number number where advertiser wishes to receive call ad may display system generated toll free number and or the ad description. The advertiser may also enter additional pieces of information and functionality pertaining to each ad including setting the daily callable hours schedule the advertiser may specify a time of day when it wants an ad to appear upload company logo to appear with ad enter coupon information e.g. the advertiser may set campaign specific discounts for users who reach a specific ad. The advertiser may then enter keywords search phrases in response to which the ad should appear. There may be several ways of entering the keywords including manual entry the advertiser may type copy the keywords manually use of a keyword suggestion tool thesaurus advertisers can view synonyms or related keywords along with estimated monthly search volume and top bids and or bulk upload advertisers may upload keywords in bulk when dealing with a high volume of keywords . The advertiser may choose that the ad s target only a subset of users such as users residing in a particular geographic region meeting a set of demographic user characteristics and or having particular types of a mobile communication facility . Advertisers may set the specific price they will be charged whenever they receive a call through the pay per call system. They may have the ability to view in real time competitors prices per category in order to ensure their ad appears in the desired position and to optimize their performance.

In embodiments keyword sales sponsored listings both pay per click and pay per call may go through an administrative and editorial review to ensure an ad pertains to the business and the categories selected by the advertiser and that the ad will be deemed appropriately relevant by a yield optimization algorithm.

In embodiments pay per click and pay per call advertisements may be priced as pay for performance in that the advertiser is charged only for those calls successfully placed through the mobile communication facility interface. It may be possible to configure the platform such that advertisers are not charged for repeat calls short calls e.g. a wrong number or other unintentional call and or hang ups or disconnections. In addition to flat per call charges some specific calls e.g. calls exceeding a given time threshold may be subject to overage fees.

In embodiments a search query may be suggested by correcting the suggested search query based in part on information relating to a client device. Once a user receives a suggested query entry a process of correction may be necessary for unambiguous query formation that is sufficient to yield intelligible and useful result set s . As part of the correction process information specific to the type of mobile communication facility may be used for example if the device has unique delivery capabilities the suggested query may need correction in order to derive a result set compatible with these capabilities. Information stored in the mobile subscriber characteristics database or parental controls facility may also be integral to the correction process.

It is possible that a suggested query returns a null result set or improbable results set. In this case the search facility in conjunction with the mobile communication facility could automatically trigger correction and iteratively cycle through alternative suggested queries until a non null or higher probability result set is delivered.

In embodiments additional recommendations may be made following a suggested query entry based upon the information related to the mobile communication facility . For example mobile subscriber characteristics carrier business rules or sponsor information in conjunction with the suggested query entry may suggest relevant recommendations for the user. The recommendations may be paired with the suggested query entry search results or presented prior to or following the display of the search results.

A user s prior search activities and search results may also be used to create recommendations for the user. Prior search activities may include transactions search queries visits to websites and other acts initiated by the user on the mobile communication facility . The geographic location of the mobile communication facility may foster recommendations including but not limited to sponsor information e.g. products and services in the user s current geographic vicinity. The current time may be used independently or in conjunction with other information to create user recommendations. For example the independent fact that it is noon may create recommendations for restaurants serving lunch. This information may be further filtered by the location of the mobile communication facility to recommend only those restaurants that are in the user s immediate vicinity and it may be further filtered by the subscriber s characteristics to recommend only that subset of restaurants serving lunch in the user s current vicinity that have received high ratings by restaurant patrons with a demographic profile similar to the user s. As with the above restaurant example similar processes for generating meaningful recommendations may be applied to other services and products including transportation navigation taxis buses trains cars airports etc. food and drink groceries drive through restaurants bars etc. entertainment theater sports movies clubs etc. business corporations workplaces banks post offices and other mailing or shipping facilities etc. consumer needs gas stations drug or clothing stores baby sitters parking etc. and information specific to the locale directions locations starting times news etc.

In embodiments data feed files may be pushed by the wireless provider to a provided FTP location. This may trigger the feed processing. Data feed files may be pulled from a wireless provider supplied FTP location. This may be done on a predefined schedule.

In embodiments deck content may be used for indexing via spidering. Spidering is the process of traversing web pages WAP pages or other online content in an automated fashion and extracting relevant content. A spider may start at one or more root nodes and traverse the links from those pages following a set of rules. Spidering may occur on a predefined schedule and may be invoked manually when requested by the wireless provider . The wireless provider may also request a manual spidering run if an immediate update is necessary or if specific links or locations are identified for additional searching. A spider may traverse a WAP deck and retrieve the necessary metadata from which a search index is built. If the WAP page for a content item enumerates comprehensive mobile communication facility compatibility information the information may be retrieved and indexed. If the WAP pages are restricted to only handsets which are compatible the spider may emulate each known mobile communication facility type to derive compatibility information.

For a WAP deck search the wireless provider may provide one or more entry points to the spider. This may be a list of one or more URLs representing content roots. The wireless provider may provide the necessary access privileges to the WAP pages. This may entail providing information about private headers e.g. X Request that may be supplied with the HTTP requests for authentication purposes or configuring the mobile application gateway such that a spider may pass through.

In embodiments data received from the wireless provider via a data feed or spidering may be maintained on equipment which is not accessible to unauthorized personnel. Thus this data may not be directly accessible to end users. Metadata may be extracted and indexes prepared from this data which may in turn be deployed in a production environment for use with services.

In embodiments quality assurance of the platform may be attained through unit tests integration tests automated regression tests for resolved issues and or manual testing of mobile communication facilities . Testing of the platform servers may be accomplished though automated testing or manual testing. Continuous testing may be used during the development stage of a project. Release qualification testing may be used when a release has entered code freeze. A process of continuous testing may ensure that behavioral changes are intentional and that quality does not degrade over time. This may be accomplished through a combination of development policies and automated testing. Each class in the server may have unit test coverage written and maintained by developers. A specific unit test may not need to be written for each and every method since some are too small to require it and some may be difficult to test in isolation. Some or all of the individual components may be tested in isolation. Unit tests may include several groups such as smoke tests a limited set of tests intended to test the most important features and run in a small amount of time exhaustive tests a larger set of tests intended to test all areas of the product fully and performance tests a set of tests that take longer to run due to the nature of the tests being performed .

In embodiments to assist identification of quality issues a continuous build process may be used. Before each submission of code change to source control developers may run the set of smoke tests and fix any unit tests that have been broken if those changes are expected and desired . An automated build machine process may watch for changes in the source control system and initiate a smoke test build anytime it notices changes that have not been tested. This process may act as a consistency check for the checked in source code. Failures in this build may be considered emergencies and may be fixed immediately by the developer who introduced the failure. Another automated build process may build the server and run the exhaustive and regression unit test suites on scheduled intervals. Failures in this automated build are may be sent to the developers who have made changes since the previous run so that issues are known about as quickly as possible. Additional automated builds include code coverage compute and calculate coded coverage metrics code analysis check for questionable code constructs and style and performance unit test suite run the long running performance unit tests .

In embodiments the platform may render to all versions of WAP and CHTML or iMODE through the use of the WALL WURFL toolkit which detects the phone version from the user and then renders appropriately. The WAP site may take advantage of capabilities of newer WAP versions and therefore render differently on different WAP versions. Testing may be used to verify that the WAP appears and functions appropriately on different phone versions. Minimal acceptance testing may be used on previously untested phones to evaluate the phone and to locate bugs. Minimal acceptance testing may also be used on phones that have previously passed full acceptance testing after small WAP site changes. Full acceptance testing may be run on mobile communication facilities that have not previously passed full acceptance testing or after major WAP changes. Testing may include but is not limited to the following steps verify basic page layout verify that the numbering is correct that the table or list is laid out properly and that the link traversal is correct check that the content item names are indented correctly verify that the Artist Name is in the correct location verify that search term matches are highlighted check that the colors of links are correct follow every link and validate that page Full Test Only and verify the numeric access keys work. The testing protocols may include the use of emulators profilers debuggers and or network monitors.

In embodiments service metrics reports may detail and summarize data regarding the operation of servers including average requests per second peak requests per second requests second distribution maximum request size and or the average response time.

In embodiments for each report type the wireless provider may request different levels of specificity for different purposes for example executive summaries that present a small amount of data in an aggregated way intended to give a high level overview a detailed summary that presents a larger set of data aggregated to provide more detailed information. This type of report may be used in circumstances where the wireless provider wants analysis of the raw data and provided with digested information and or transaction logs that present raw data collected. This type of report may be used when the wireless provider would like to do its own analysis.

In embodiments reports may be formatted using raw line based log file mostly used for transaction logs XML HTML formatted by applying XSL to the XML and or plain text formatted by applying XSL to the XML .

In embodiments reports may be delivered using email where the wireless provider provides an email address. The subject of the message may include the name of the report and a timestamp. Reports may also be delivered by FTP where the wireless provider provides a host name user name password and directory name. Reports are then delivered as file drops into the given directory. The filenames include the name of the report a timestamp and sequence number.

In embodiments the deployment architecture may consist of dynamically scalable hardware and software to handle incoming requests. One element of the architecture may be a cluster. A cluster may comprise three machines one front end web server and two back end service tier servers. The web server may run Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Apache HTTP Server. The service tier servers may run Red Hat Enterprise Linux Apache HTTP Server Apache Tomcat and MySQL. A minimum of two clusters may be used for load balancing fail over and redundancy. Additional clusters may be deployed as is necessary to handle additional server load. The cluster may receive requests from the mobile communication facility via HTTP and reply with results which are retrieved from cache or by querying various databases. The cluster may also be used to handle download requests for mobile communication facility applications. Each cluster may handle 5 QPS or 450 000 requests per day. An incoming request may be distributed to one of the front end web servers via load balancing hardware and then the connection between the front end web server and a back end service tier server may be distributed via load balancing hardware. The connections from the mobile communication facility to the servers may be stateless. Each connection may be distributed appropriately. Feed servers may be used to process data feeds from the wireless provider the server web logs and the server tomcat logs. These feed servers may run Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Output from the feed servers may be stored in a data warehouse which is used for data analysis reporting and generation of the input tables for the MySQL databases which reside on the service tier servers. The data warehouse may run Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Oracle Database 10 g.

The data center architecture may employ an administration server which ensures that the other servers are configured properly moves log files to the feed servers and monitors the health of the servers. The servers may utilize fibre channel RAID SAN or other redundant mass storage techniques for reliability scalability and performance. The drives may be backed up to tape utilizing industry standard backup procedures including offsite storage and rotation. Similar hardware and software may be used for development and QA environments. The development environment and the QA environment may each utilize their own cluster set.

In embodiments the release of upgrades may be performed using a rolling upgrade where it is not required that the same version be available simultaneously. A service tier server may be removed from service in the load balancers while it is upgraded and verified. It may then be restored to service and the next service tier server is upgraded. Upgrades may also be performed by a maintenance upgrade where it is required that the same version be deployed and available simultaneously. A maintenance page may be deployed and all of the clusters removed from service in the load balancers while they are upgraded and verified. The clusters may then be restored to service in the load balancers. The upgrades may be scheduled during hours of minimal usage.

In embodiments the web servers may be protected by a managed firewall deployed at the public internet. The firewall may contain ACLs which control the types of networks and traffic that can communicate with the web servers. The servers may be managed by the data center and loaded with a hardened version of the O S and anti virus software. The O S may be kept up to date using automated patch management software. Outside access may be restricted to secure channels via VPN SSH or a private backend network. Access by data center personnel for administrative purposes may be authenticated and logged.

In embodiments the platform may be integrated with the wireless provider s existing deck using a variety of integration techniques that apply for the WAP version or the downloadable application. The results and item detail pages may be available as full WAP 1.2 2.0 pages served directly from servers the hosted option or as XML data suitable for formatting and rendering within the wireless provider s deck the API option . The wireless provider may be responsible for selecting the appropriate DNS name for the service e.g. search.carrier.com and for configuring its DNS records to point to the appropriate servers. The wireless provider may be responsible for selecting the appropriate customization and or skinning options. If the wireless provider wishes its users to take advantage of advanced search features such as the recommendation engine the wireless provider may be responsible for configuring its mobile application gateway such that an agreed upon unique ID is transmitted to the appropriate servers. The end user s mobile browser and the capabilities of the mobile communication facility may be identified and the pages served directly to the end user s mobile browser.

In embodiments the J2ME application may periodically check for updates and notify the user that an update is available. The user may choose to update the application immediately in which case the application initiates downloading and installing an update. The user may choose to update the application by visiting the application download WAP site and initiating an update. Or the user may choose to request a WAP push of an update.

In embodiments the application may use an SMS connection to receive update notifications via SMS which causes the mobile application facility AMS to run the application which then may offer update options to the user.

In embodiments BREW versions of the client may not use all the mechanisms used by J2ME versions for updating. In BREW environments applications may poll to find updates and application directed SMS may be used to wake up applications to notify the user of updates. Users may download updates from a BREW provider.

In embodiments a search facility may process both structured and unstructured data. The primary categories that must be completed when defining a feed file include primary feed file attributes file name description header row column descriptions trailer row column descriptions detail row column descriptions non conventional file name description if applicable and feed production schedule.

In embodiments a data source may uniquely define a wireless provider and the feed files for a given wireless provider may be referenced under the given wireless provider s data source. The feed type may define the specific type or category of data that will be contained within the feed file. Some primary feed types may include the following log feed files that contain logged data personal feed files that contain provider specific member profile data and deck feed files that contain content data . There may be many derivations of deck data including but not limited to DeckArtist DeckHandset DeckCategory and DeckLanguage. The feed protocol may specify whether a feed is either a request feed or a response feed. The protocol may define the intent of the sending wireless provider . The sending wireless provider may request that the given feed be processed by the receiving provider . The sending provider may send a feed in response to a previous feed received from the receiving provider in order to complete a feed contract. A feed ID may be used to define a four part feed name which uniquely defines a given type of feed for a given provider . The four part feed naming convention may specify the sending partner ID the receiving partner ID the feed type and the feed protocol e.g. Acme Provider Log Request . The feed may be inbound or outbound. Defining the feed direction may help to determine behavior in how the feed engine treats a given feed such as the type of feed file directories that are created for a given feed.

In embodiments the document type may specify the physical structure of a feed file. A feed file s physical structure may be defined by the fixed column format the delimited column format and or the XML Format. The columns defined for a given row type may have a fixed length. The rows of a given type may have a fixed length. For example a feed file may consist of the following cardinality of row types 0 or 1 Header row 0 to many Detail rows and 0 to 1 Trailer row. Each row type may have a different fixed length. Columns defined for the rows in a given feed may be separated by a one character delimiter e.g. a bar . Each row in the feed may represent a type of XML element. A header row or a detail row may be defined by one element. Detail rows may have many different types of row elements. A detail with more than one type of row element may be defined as variant rows within a feed document. Detail rows may make up all of the rows between the header row and trailer row within a feed file. A feed file may be defined as having either one non variant row type or as two or more variant row types. When all of the detail rows within a feed file have the exact same column structure the detail rows are said to be non variant. When some of the detail rows within a feed file have a different column structure than other detail rows within the same feed file the detail rows are said to be variant. The sequence number may be used to uniquely define the feed file name for a given provider . It may also define the behavior of how a feed file is treated. The sequence number may be defined as incremental progressive or TimeStamp. If the sequence number is defined as incremental each feed may follow in sequence from one feed to the next the increment is one 1 . This type of sequence number may be used when it is important to track or receive a feed in an exact sequence. If the sequence number is defined as progressive each feed may have a sequence number greater than the one before it. If the sequence number is defined as TimeStamp each feed may be given a time stamp as its sequence number. The sequence number may have the full time stamp format of yyyyMMddHHmmss. The line delimiter may define the type of character or characters that are used to mark the end of a line. If the document type of a feed file is defined as delimited then a character delimiter may be defined as the token which separates each column within each and every row within a given feed file. The column delimiter may be a bar .

In embodiments the deck platform may serve as a central place for handling the mobile search service provided by the wireless provider . The system may interact with portal management systems charging system other delivery systems and all other wireless provider internal or 3rd party systems needed to provide end to end mobile search service. As part of the overall search system the deck may also provide management of the marketers relational aspects bidding arena report access and may provide a unified interface for managing media bearer agnostic search service e.g. 3G 2.5G MMS SMS Downloadable content streaming content .

In embodiments the platform provides an alert and or messaging system for the wireless provider to handle events that the provider may encounter during the operation of the deck system. A severity level for each message may be presented ranging form indeterminate severity to a warning severity level that is likely to affect the service. A fault manager may be used to define a common structure that describes possible solution element s events and alarms. This structure may be generic and is intended to support all types of events. Additionally performance counters may record performance security issues.

In embodiments the deck may utilize SNMP protocol as the means to transfer alarms and status events to the wireless provider s alarm and monitor system. The wireless provider may specify which network monitoring solution is being used the access details needed to establish such a connection SNMP server address and port and open a tunnel through its firewall systems so SNMP traps may arrive. The deck may use a standard MIB structure to relay alarms and may adjust to any specific MIB structure. A web tool may be hosted on a secure server which provides the wireless provider with access to the contents of event and alert messages.

An aspect of the present invention relates to providing useful responses to information entered into an address bar of a mobile communication facility when the information does not properly correspond with an existing URL or other website reference. In embodiments a user of a mobile communication facility may enter information into an address bar on the mobile communication facility and the information may be a misspelled URL an unknown URL or the like. In other situations the user may have been entering search terms rather than a URL thinking the address bar was the search query entry facility. There are many reasons that mis information may be entered into an address bar on a mobile communication facility and embodiments of the present invention serve to provide a user with useful information even after entering such misinformation.

In embodiments misinformation entered into the address bar of a mobile communication facility may be a wrong url a mis typed url may not correspond with a presently active webpage may be a broken link missing page or other information that cannot be matched with a website url or other site indication.

The prediction associated with step may be based on a disambiguation facility e.g. as described herein in connection with a correction facility e.g. as described herein in connection with or other facility designed to predict what site the user intended to visit. For example the text entered into the address bar may have been correctly associated with a URL except for the fact that the .com was not included it was mistyped misspelled or the true extension was .net or it otherwise included erroneous extension information. A prediction facility associated with step may go through a process of including or replacing extensions to find associated web sites. As another example of misinformation included in the address bar the text may have included mistyping and the like associated with the prefix e.g. typing wwe. instead of www. or entering a comma instead of a period before the URL . A prediction facility associated with step may go through a process of including or replacing the prefix information to find associated websites. As yet another example of misinformation included in the address bar the user may have misspelled the URL entered an abbreviated URL entered search terms instead of a URL or the like. A prediction facility associated with step may go through a process of spell checking and correcting the text with what is perceived as the intended target site. In the course of predicting and correcting the text to associate the mis directed text entry the prediction facility may use other techniques for aiding the user e.g. those described in connection with correcting disambiguating and otherwise aiding the user in better targeting search query as described herein e.g. as described herein in connection with .

Once a site is predicted through step the predicted site may be entered and presented on the mobile communication facility . The process of predicting the desired site may also involve predicting and then searching for the predicted site . If the predicted site does not exist or respond a prediction facility associated with the prediction step may refine the prediction and search again. This process may be undertaken several times until a predicted site is located or until the process times out due to some preset timeout period for example.

In embodiments a process for predicting the desired site from misinformation entered into an address bar of a mobile communication facility may involve the steps of predicting the desired site after receiving an indication that no site exists or responds to the misinformation. The prediction may involve correction disambiguation or other such techniques as described herein. For example the prediction may involve using information related to the mobile communication facility e.g. mobile subscriber characteristic information to assist the disambiguation or correction of the misinformation. Once a prediction is made the prediction may be tested e.g. a search for a related URL may be conducted the prediction may be presented to the user as a suggestion or the site associated with the prediction may be entered and presented for example.

Once an error or other indication the desired site is unavailable is produced the text entered into the address bar may be used as a search query e.g. in a similar fashion as if the text were entered into a search query facility as described in connection with . For example the text may be disambiguated if it is ambiguous it may be corrected e.g. the spelling may be checked and corrected or suggestions related to the query disambiguated query or corrected query may be produced for the user. Once the search query corrected search query or disambiguated search query is determined it may then be used to perform a search for results . The search may produce results and or produce suggestions or other related information . For example as disclosed in connection with other embodiments herein e.g. in connection with the search results or suggestions may be produced in coordination with information relating to the mobile communication facility e.g. mobile subscriber characteristic information . In embodiments an algorithm facility e.g. as illustrated in connection with may be used in connection with information relating to the mobile communication facility to better predict what the user is looking for.

In embodiments a process for searching for information relating to misinformation entered into an address bar of a mobile communication facility may involve the steps of producing a search query from the text entered in the address bar after receiving an indication that no site exists or responds to the misinformation. The search query may involve correction disambiguation or other such techniques as described herein. For example the development of the search query may involve using information related to the mobile communication facility e.g. mobile subscriber characteristic information to assist the disambiguation or correction of the misinformation. Once a search query is made search results and or suggestions and or recommendations or other information relating to the text entered in the address bar may be presented to the user on the mobile communication facility.

The text entered from the address bar may be processed through a disambiguation facility correction facility or other facility adapted to modify the text into a form more appropriate for a search on the mobile communication facility. The processed query may then be used as a search query and a search may be performed. Results suggestions and or other information pertaining to the processed query may be produced and displayed on a display associated with the mobile communication facility .

Following the error or other indication that the site is unavailable a redirected site may be chosen . The redirection may be based on a table algorithm or information relating to the originally unavailable site indicating the correct site. For example the unavailable site may produce information indicating there is a related site. A referenced URL may be provided for example. Given this redirection information the mobile communication facility may be redirected to the new site.

In embodiments information relating to the mobile communication facility may be used to redirect the user to a redirected site. For example a user may misspell a URL and information relating to the mobile communication facility may indicate what the user intended to enter. For example mobile characteristic information may contain information showing that the user has recently viewed a site with a very similar URL to the mistyped URL entered and the previously visited site may be presented to the user. In embodiments an indication that the URL as entered was unavailable may also be presented to the user indicating a process of suggesting alternatives was used.

In embodiments the redirection search text processing results presentation suggestions or other methods of managing information entered into the address bar of a mobile communication facility may be aided through an algorithm facility . The algorithm facility may use information relating to the mobile communication facility in the process of determining what information the user is most interested in. The algorithm facility may be a collaborative filter or personal for example and the filter may use information from the mobile characteristics database in the process of delivering user targeted results.

Another aspect of the present invention relates to processing errors related to search queries and address queries entered on a mobile communication facility. In embodiments the error processing may be accomplished through software on the mobile communication facility. In embodiments the error processing may be accomplished through software remote from the mobile communication facility e.g. on a server associated with a wireless provider or associated with the wireless communication facility . In embodiments the error processing may be done using software processing in part on the mobile communication facility and in part on a platform remote from the mobile communication facility.

Once an error or the like is produced the software platform on the mobile communication facility may respond to the error in a variety of ways e.g. the error processing associated with . For example as indicated in connection with the software on the mobile communication facility may predict a desired site use the text as a search query further process the text entered redirect the mobile communication facility to another website or otherwise perform a process in response to the error . Following the error processing the mobile communication facility may generate and communicate an additional request for information . This may be similar to the requests for information described in connection with . For example a request to enter a newly predicted website e.g. as described in connection with may be made. Following the request to enter the newly predicted website an error or the like may be produced and the process may be re executed . Ultimately the mobile communication facility may receive an indication of the predicted site or the predicted site may be presented. As another example the new request may be formed as a search query or a processed query e.g. disambiguated intended to be fed into a search engine as described in connection with . As yet another example the new request may be a redirected request as described in connection with . It should be noted that a user may intend to place a search query into the location box intentionally.

An aspect of the present invention relates to providing sponsored links. In embodiments a sponsor may be provided with an interface to allow it to enter sponsor information such as bidding information content to be presented in the event a bid is won contact information device compatible information profiles the sponsor is targeting locations the sponsor is targeting and the like. For example a sponsorship facility e.g. as described in connection with may be adapted with a sponsorship entry facility. The sponsorship facility may perform other functions in connection with providing sponsored links on a mobile communication facility as well. For example the sponsorship facility may facilitate a bidding process and or present the sponsored content to the mobile communication facility. In embodiments information relating to the mobile communication facility e.g. mobile subscriber characteristic information may be used in the sponsored link process.

In embodiments the sponsor may enter a bidding process to provide certain sponsored content to a mobile communication facility through a sponsor entry facility . The sponsor may provide bid information such as max bids for certain keyword matches content information compatibility information and the like. Once the sponsor has entered the sponsor process through the sponsor entry facility it may be in a position to display the sponsored content on a mobile communication facility in exchange for a bid amount. A user may enter a search query on the mobile communication facility the query may be transmitted to a bidding facility where a bidding process may take place to determine which sponsor s content is going to be provided to the mobile communication facility . The bidding process may result in the award of certain sponsored content as identified in the awardees information it originally indicated during the entry process. For example the sponsor may have indicated that upon an award a link or other content should be presented to the mobile communication facility.

A sponsor may present the mobile communication facility with purchasable content and a user may purchase the content through the mobile communication facility and make payment for the content through the wireless provider . For example the content may be a downloadable ringtone music file video file wall paper or the like. The sponsor may elect to provide billing for such content through the wireless provider billing facility . This may provide a convenient secure and or trusted user transaction. The user may be comfortable in purchasing the content through his wireless provider as it may provide more of an appearance that it is provided from a known source. This may generate more of a walled garden feel from the user s perspective while allowing the user to search for and or receive such content on the open web. When the sponsor allows for payment of the content through the wireless provider payment facility the wireless provider may receive a portion of the user s payment or some other compensation in return for the billing service.

In embodiments the sponsor payment facility may be used to pay for sponsored links that were awarded and or presented to a mobile communication facility . For example once sponsored content is awarded and or presented to the mobile communication facility the bidding facility may request payment for the bid amount from the sponsor payment facility . The sponsor payment facility may then process payment to the wireless provider payment facility for example.

The user interface may also include a bid entry facility . The bid entry facility may provide a sponsor with the ability to enter bid amounts and corresponding bid criteria. For example a maximum bid amount may be associated with criteria such as keyword relevancy match. In embodiments the maximum bid may be associated with simple matching criteria e.g. such as matching a keyword or it may be associated with a more complicated sting or weighted string of terms events or characteristics. For example while a sponsor may provide a maximum bid of 0.10 for a keyword match it may provide a bid of 0.15 for a combination of keyword and location or 0.20 for a combination of keyword location and phone type. As another example the sponsor may bid 0.15 for a bid associated with a location and time of day if the search is an implicit search. While certain illustrations of bid criteria associated with bid amounts have been provided it should be understood that the criteria matching may be any type of matching including without limitation weighted function matching algorithm based matching or any other type of rule based algorithmic heuristic or other matching.

In embodiments a sponsor desirous of presenting its content on a mobile communication facility may be presented a plurality of menu formats with which to create sponsor content including but not limited to advertisements promotional notices offers and so on. For example the menu system may provide a sponsor an entry menu within which it may be possible for the sponsor to create a title for sponsor content include an URL street address phone number or other contact information. It may be possible to enter additional descriptive text by line by paragraph and or page.

In embodiments a sponsor desirous of presenting its content on a mobile communication facility may be presented a plurality of menu formats with which to select the types of mobile communication facilities on which the sponsor would like to present the sponsor content. For example the sponsor may wish to select a subset of mobile communication facility models that are best suited for presentation of the sponsor s content due to technological requirements for the content to optimally present. A sponsor may choose to present only on mobile communication facility models that are associated with other user characteristics that the sponsor would like to target e.g. a cell phone model known to have high usage among college students .

In embodiments a sponsor desirous of presenting its content on a mobile communication facility may be presented a plurality of menu formats with which to select the mobile communication facility platform and or software types on which the sponsor would like to present the sponsor content. For example a sponsor may have content that requires a Java enabled device. Therefore it may be desirable for the sponsor to select to present its content only on those mobile communication facilities that are Java enabled.

In embodiments a sponsor desirous of presenting its content on a mobile communication facility may be presented a plurality of menu formats from which to select key words and or key phrases to associate with the sponsor s information. The menus may present individual words lists of words and or phrases for which a sponsor may enter a bid amount. The bid amount may be a specific price a price range or a maximum price that the sponsor is willing to pay in order to have its content associated with the language.

In embodiments a sponsor desirous of presenting its content on a mobile communication facility may be presented with keyword suggestions based upon keywords entered and or selected by the sponsor. For example a thesaurus may be employed to automatically present sponsors with additional keywords that are related to the keywords in which a sponsor manifests an interest in bidding.

In embodiments a sponsor desirous of presenting its content on a mobile communication facility may be presented a plurality of menu formats from which to select geographic variables to associate with the sponsor s information. The menus may present individual area codes city names state names country names location entered by a user and or be based upon GPS information derived from a location facility. Geographic information may also be presented in relation to other mobile subscriber characteristics. For example a sponsor in the hotel business may be interested in having its content present to only those users that are outside of their hometown and or normal work region.

In embodiments a sponsor desirous of presenting its content on a mobile communication facility may be presented a plurality of menu formats from which to select demographic variables to associate with the sponsor s information. The menus may present individual demographic variables contained in the mobile subscriber characteristics database such as age sex race address income billing history purchase history and so forth.

In embodiments sponsors content may be displayed on a mobile communication facility in a descending rank order based upon the sponsors bid amounts.

In embodiments sponsors content may be displayed on a mobile communication facility in a descending rank order based upon the amount of shared revenue derived from sponsors.

In embodiments sponsors content may be displayed and or ordered on a mobile communication facility based at least in part on using time as a criteria.

In embodiments sponsors content may be displayed and or ordered on a mobile communication facility based at least in part on a mobile subscriber characteristic such as the user device type geography transaction and or history.

In embodiments sponsors content may be displayed and or ordered on a mobile communication facility based at least in part on the relevancy of the sponsored content. For example relevancy may be based upon the information contained in a sponsor s content and keywords entered by a user in a query entry facility . Relevancy may be based upon the sponsor s content and mobile subscriber characteristics such as user device type geography transaction and or history.

In embodiments sponsors content may be displayed and or ordered on a mobile communication facility based at least in part on a grouping or aggregation of mobile subscriber characteristics. For example sponsors content may be displayed on the basis of users age ranges e.g. 20 30 year olds .

In embodiments the amounts payable as a result of the sponsor billing process may be processed within the billing system of a wireless provider. For example when the sponsor enters a wireless provider s bidding system it may enter into an agreement with the wireless provider such that any presented sponsored content is paid for. The payment may come directly from the sponsor to the wireless provider for example. In embodiments a user of the mobile communication facility may interact with sponsored content e.g. click on a sponsored line and make a transaction within the sponsored content e.g. the user may purchase a music download ringtone wall paper or the like . In such embodiments the purchase price of the purchased content may appear on the user s wireless provider bill as opposed to being billed from the sponsor.

In embodiments mobile communication facility users may be classified on a combination of mobile subscriber characteristics device type location behavioral history transaction history or other parameters and the resulting classes presented in a menu format to sponsors for bidding. For example it may be possible to statistically model the user characteristics within a population of a wireless provider s customer base that are most likely to purchase tickets for a Caribbean cruise. Once this model is known all customers with approximately the profile described by the model could be grouped in a Caribbean Cruisers category. This category may then be included in a menu system along with other categories and presented to sponsors for bidding. Swimwear companies sunglass companies etc. may have an increased interest in bidding for access to the Caribbean Cruisers category because of the increased probability that users in this category have a need for their products. Summary of the many characteristics variables used in the model into a single category may make the bidding process less time consuming to sponsors and may constitute a proprietary product. Furthermore the statistical model may be continually updated to accommodate changing user preferences.

In embodiments a sponsor s website may be evaluated to determine the frequency of the appearance of key words and or key phrases. Once the keyword and or key phrase frequency is known a site relevancy score may be derived indicating the relevance of keywords to the content of a sponsor s website. This relevancy score may then be used to assist sponsors in their bidding making it easier for sponsors to focus their finances on keywords and or key phrases with the greatest relevancy to their content.

In embodiments the behaviors of mobile communication facility users may be automatically collected and the bid values in the bidding system adjusted to reflect user behaviors. For example user calls clicks clickthroughs purchases and yield optimization may be automated and used to change the value of minimum or maximum bid values associated with a keyword.

In embodiments an editorial review process may be used to evaluate the appropriateness of sponsors selections of criteria with which to associate their content. For example it may be inappropriate to have a sponsor associate adult content with keywords commonly associated with the interests of children. The editorial process may assist in locating and remedying such incongruities.

In embodiments an automated spidering tool may be used to periodically monitor changes in sponsors content and determine the reliability of the sponsor links. For example a sponsor may update a website to such an extent that the sponsor s content that was previously associated with keywords through a bidding process is no longer reliable i.e. the content is no longer located where the links direct a user . When this occurs the system may send an alert to the sponsor indicating that the reliability of the sponsor content links is insufficient. They may serve to improve the overall reliability of the system.
