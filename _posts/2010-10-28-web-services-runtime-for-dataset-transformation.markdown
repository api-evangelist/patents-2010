title: Web services runtime for dataset transformation
abstract: Various aspects for providing a runtime for dataset transformation are disclosed. In one aspect, data consumption requests are received. The requested data is retrieved from a web service in an arbitrary form, and subsequently transformed into a standardized result from the arbitrary form. In another aspect, a user interface is displayed to a content provider, and an input identifying a transform function selected by the content provider is received via the user interface. A transform assembly is then generated based on the input, which facilitates retrieving data from a web service in an arbitrary form, and transforming the data into a standardized result by calling the selected transform function. In yet another aspect, third party code is associated with a transform assembly. An execution of the third party code is then managed such that at least one aspect of the transform assembly is operated according to the execution.

The subject disclosure relates to a runtime transformation of arbitrary web services data in connection with providing information as a service.

By way of background concerning some conventional systems computing devices have traditionally stored information and associated applications and data services locally to the device. Yet with the evolution of on line and cloud services information is increasingly being moved to network providers who perform none some or all of service on behalf of devices. The evolution of network storage farms capable of storing terabytes of data with potential for petabytes exabytes etc. of data in the future has created an opportunity to mimic the local scenario in a cloud with separation of the primary device and the external storage.

However no cloud service or network storage provider has been able to effectively provide information as a service on any platform with publishers developers and consumers easily publishing specializing applications for and consuming any kind of data in a way that can be tracked and audited for all involved. In addition due to the disparate number of content providers and their typically proprietary schemas for defining data today where disparate content providers do not coordinate their publishing acts to the cloud with one another there is little opportunity to leverage the collective power of such disparate publishing acts.

Content providers who choose to store their data via web services may be reluctant to move their data elsewhere. In order to provide such data for consumption it would thus be desirable to integrate web services into an infrastructure that facilitates information as a service. To this end it is noted that data sets stored in relational databases generally exhibit a consistency and uniformity that allows them to be queried and exposed in a uniform manner. Data sets stored in web services however lack consistency and uniformity which makes efficiently exposing such data particularly challenging. Accordingly it would thus be desirable to provide a mechanism for integrating arbitrary data originating from web services into an infrastructure that facilitates information as a service.

The above described deficiencies of today s devices and data services are merely intended to provide an overview of some of the problems of conventional systems and are not intended to be exhaustive. Other problems with the state of the art and corresponding benefits of some of the various non limiting embodiments may become further apparent upon review of the following detailed description.

A simplified summary is provided herein to help enable a basic or general understanding of various aspects of exemplary non limiting embodiments that follow in the more detailed description and the accompanying drawings. This summary is not intended however as an extensive or exhaustive overview. Instead the sole purpose of this summary is to present some concepts related to some exemplary non limiting embodiments in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description of the various embodiments that follow.

In accordance with one or more embodiments and corresponding disclosure various non limiting aspects are described in connection with providing information as a service from any platform. In one such aspect a method that facilitates providing a runtime for dataset transformation is disclosed. The method can include receiving a request directed to consumption of data associated with a content provider. Here it is contemplated that the data can be stored in at least one database. The embodiment can further include retrieving the data from a web service in an arbitrary form as well as transforming the data into a standardized result from the arbitrary form.

In another aspect a method for generating a transform assembly to facilitate a runtime dataset transformation is disclosed. A user interface is displayed to a content provider and an input from the content provider is received via the user interface. Here the content provider is associated with consumable data stored in at least one database and the input identifies at least one transform function selected by the content provider. The method can further include generating a transform assembly based on the input. For this embodiment the transform assembly retrieves the data from a web service in an arbitrary form and also transforms the data into a standardized result by calling the at least one transform function.

In yet another aspect a method for executing third party code to facilitate a runtime dataset transformation is disclosed. This embodiment includes associating a third party code with a transform assembly. Here the transform assembly retrieves data from a web service in an arbitrary form and also transforms the data into a common intermediate format. The method further includes managing an execution of the third party code and operating at least one aspect of the transform assembly according to the execution.

Other embodiments and various non limiting examples scenarios and implementations are described in more detail below.

Various aspects are disclosed which automatically integrate web services and transformation functions into an infrastructure that facilitates information as a service. As discussed in the background it is desirable to expose arbitrary data sets originating from both databases and web services. To this end it is noted that data sets stored in relational databases generally exhibit a consistency and uniformity that allows them to be queried and exposed in a uniform manner. Data sets stored in web services however lack consistency and uniformity which makes efficiently exposing such data particularly challenging.

The various embodiments disclosed herein are directed towards resolving the lack of consistency and uniformity in web services which allows web services to be substantially treated like a relational store with some graceful degradation based on the support particular web services may offer. For instance in an aspect a web services transformation runtime is disclosed which creates an application environment whereby content providers can provide an assembly that transforms the current behavior of their web service into behavior compliant with providing information as a service. Moreover depending on its current behavior it is contemplated that a web service s behavior may be augmented and or that a level of compliancy and desired graceful degradation of the behavior can be captured. By isolating transformation code and capturing transformation metadata the runtime is able to provide any of a plurality of services. For example in a particular embodiment the runtime is configured to provide a pipeline of multiple transformations which connect to a billing infrastructure. Embodiments are also disclosed which facilitate developing custom transformations.

It is contemplated that runtime unit will thus provide content providers with a desirable application environment for transforming the current behavior of their web service into behavior compliant with providing information as a service. In an aspect runtime unit facilitates a unification of return values associated with on boarded web services towards standardized result sets. By providing such unification datasets originating from both web services and relational stores can be managed in a uniform manner. Further aspects are also contemplated in which web services are mapped onto parameterized functions that return standardized result sets. Indeed by mapping web services onto parameterized functions relational store capabilities of web services data can be realized including for example projection filtering ordering joining and even the ability to accept a serialized language integrated query LINQ expression tree as input.

In another aspect runtime unit enables content providers to on board a large range of web services with different feature levels i.e. levels of functional support . For this particular embodiment it is contemplated that such feature levels can be configured during on boarding of a web service regardless of whether the web service is delivering the feature and or whether the feature is provided by runtime unit . By implementing this approach a gradual increase in functionality is enabled which allows for differentiated offerings by the content providers. Content providers can thus be charged based on the particular value s of application programming interfaces APIs they utilize in their feature level.

In another aspect it is contemplated that transformations may be utilized through a query to produce a bindable schema to user interface elements such as charts and graphs. Namely embodiments are disclosed whereby content providers can use and extend the transformation methods described herein to bind to visual elements such as charts and graphs. Here it should be further noted that transformations can also be attached to assets which go beyond developer scenarios.

In yet a further aspect runtime unit can be configured to facilitate a custom worker role. Within such embodiment well defined APIs and a configurable pipeline of transformation functions can be offered wherein operational management support can be provided such as scaling security patches health monitoring etc. For this particular embodiment a mechanism is also disclosed whereby independent software vendors ISVs can plug in their solutions for any of a various scenarios including for example complex on boarding and or billing scenarios.

Referring next to a block diagram of an exemplary runtime unit configured to facilitate dataset transformations according to an embodiment is provided. As shown runtime unit can include processor component memory component request component retrieval component transform component service component generation component and library component .

In one aspect processor component is configured to execute computer readable instructions related to performing any of a plurality of functions. Processor component can be a single processor or a plurality of processors dedicated to analyzing information to be communicated from runtime unit and or generating information that can be utilized by memory component request component retrieval component transform component service component generation component and or library component . Additionally or alternatively processor component can be configured to control one or more components of runtime unit .

In another aspect memory component is coupled to processor component and configured to store computer readable instructions executed by processor component . Memory component can also be configured to store any of a plurality of other types of data including generated by any of request component retrieval component transform component service component generation component and or library component . Memory component can be configured in a number of different configurations including as random access memory battery backed memory hard disk magnetic tape etc. Various features can also be implemented upon memory component such as compression and automatic back up e.g. use of a Redundant Array of Independent Drives configuration.

Runtime unit can also include request component and retrieval component . Within such embodiment request component can be configured to receive requests for consuming data associated with a content provider and stored in at least one database whereas retrieval component is configured to retrieve the data from a web service in an arbitrary form. Here to facilitate retrieving data stored in any of a plurality of forms retrieval component can be configured to map the web service onto a parameterized function.

As illustrated runtime unit can further include transform component which is configured to transform data retrieved by retrieval component into a standardized result. In an aspect data transformed by transform component can be further processed while in its transformed state. To facilitate such embodiment runtime unit can include services component which is configured to process standardized results in any of a plurality of ways. For instance it is contemplated that such processing may include performing a projection a filtering an ordering and or a joining operation on the standardized result. Other embodiments are also contemplated wherein the retrieved data is transformed into a tabular result configured to accept a serialized language integrated query LINQ expression tree as input.

In an aspect services component can also be configured to process standardized results according to a hierarchy of feature levels. Namely an embodiment is disclosed in which a feature level is associated with each content provider wherein services component is configured to limit its processing of transformed data to a set of operations authorized by the particular feature level associated with a corresponding content provider. Within such embodiment it is further contemplated that feature levels can be toggled according to an input received from the content provider. Indeed since content providers may desire require different levels of support services component can be configured to bill content providers according to the particular feature level selected by each content provider. A scalable billing model is thus disclosed in which each feature level can be monetized based on a location of the feature level within the hierarchy. For example a feature level that provides more processing capabilities for the transformed data can be priced higher than another feature level which may provide less processing capabilities.

As illustrated runtime unit can also include generation component which is configured to generate transform assemblies based on inputs received from content providers. For this particular embodiment transform component can be configured to transform data via such transform assemblies. Moreover transform assemblies can be generated which transform data by calling any of a plurality of transform functions. To this end it is contemplated that at least a subset of the transform functions may be stored locally and or externally. For instance in an aspect library component can be configured to maintain a local library of selectable transform functions. In another aspect however retrieval component can be configured to access an external library of selectable transform functions.

In a further aspect compilation unit can provide content providers with a no source code just configuration experience to configure their web service in the runtime unit. Within such embodiment transform assemblies are generated automatically with a metadata API and runtime APIs wherein a manifest based on a conceptual model CSDL is utilized. This approach allows content providers to on board transform assemblies without writing code while still reaping the run time benefits provided by the runtime unit.

Here it should be noted that a configuration based approach defines how to assemble a transformation wherein content providers may only specify repeating nodes and how to fill the properties of such repeating nodes. In an aspect XPath expressions can be used to fill each of these properties. Exemplary properties can for example include how to expose the web service the web service uri to call the input parameters and or the definition of the results including how to flatten an XML response of the web service.

Referring next to a block diagram illustrates an exemplary compilation unit configured to generate a transformation assembly in accordance with various aspects. As illustrated compilation unit can include processor component memory component interface component selection component and generation component .

Similar to processor component in runtime unit processor component is configured to execute computer readable instructions related to performing any of a plurality of functions. Processor component can be a single processor or a plurality of processors dedicated to analyzing information to be communicated from compilation unit and or generating information that can be utilized by memory component interface component selection component and or generation component . Additionally or alternatively processor component can be configured to control one or more components of compilation unit .

In another aspect memory component is coupled to processor component and configured to store computer readable instructions executed by processor component . Memory component can also be configured to store any of a plurality of other types of data including data generated by any of interface component selection component and or generation component . Here it is noted that memory component is analogous to memory component in runtime unit . Accordingly it can be appreciated that any of the aforementioned features configurations of memory component are also applicable to memory component .

As illustrated compilation unit can also include interface component and selection component . Within such embodiment interface component is configured to display a user interface to a content provider whereas selection component is configured to identify at least one transform function selected by the content provider via the user interface. For this particular embodiment it is contemplated that content providers are associated with data consumable from an infrastructure providing information as a service.

In a further aspect compilation unit can also include generation component which is configured to generate a transform assembly based on the transform function s selected by the content provider. Here it is contemplated that transform assemblies generated by generation component can be configured to retrieve data from a web service in an arbitrary form and transform the retrieved data into a standardized result. Moreover transform assemblies can be generated which transform data into a standardized result from an arbitrary form by calling transform functions selected by the content provider. To this end it should be noted that transform assemblies can be configured to call externally stored transform functions as well as locally stored transform functions.

In a further aspect it is contemplated that generation component can be configured to generate transform assemblies in any of a plurality of ways. For instance generation component can be configured to bind transform functions to a graphical representation of transformed data. Generation component can also be configured to link multiple transform functions selected by a content provider. In a particular embodiment generation component is configured to link a first transform function with a second transform function wherein at least one of the first transform function or the second transform function are provided by an independent software vendor ISV .

It should also be noted that generation component can be further configured to provide content providers with a user friendly mechanism for generating custom transform assemblies. For example an embodiment is disclosed in which a codeless input is received from the content provider. Within such embodiment generation component is configured generate transform assemblies by executing at least one application programming interface API according to a manifest based on a conceptual model CSDL .

It is contemplated that any of a plurality of runtime features services may be supported via third party code. For instance an automatic configurable scale out and load balancing of worker roles can be provided. Indeed with increased demand additional instances of the custom worker role will be instantiated which will result in additional costs for the content provider but which will be directly attributable to revenue generation. Other desirable runtime features services can include integrating into a billing platform for information as a service which can allow for custom billing events. Health monitoring both of worker role unit as well as the back end web service can also be provided. An isolation of execution can also be supported as provided by the worker role concept. Further runtime features services which are supportable can include compliance logging formatting paging projection i.e. augmenting a basic web service to provide more features as well as the ability to compose with other third party services i.e. a join feature .

Several load time features services are also contemplated. For instance a feature service can be implemented in which a transformation assembly exposes a standard interface to be called by the runtime and return a standard result set. A feature service can also be implemented in which a transformation assembly exposes an API to access a metadata document describing the details of a result set.

With respect to on boarding time exemplary features services are also disclosed. For instance a feature service can be implemented in which an upload of the content provider s transformation assembly includes code to call the web service and transform the response into a well defined result set. A code verification feature service for the transformation assembly at on board time can also be implemented to ensure security compliance. Furthermore semantics of parameters and columns in a result set can be defined to create a basis for the meshing composing of datasets.

Referring next to a block diagram illustrates an exemplary worker role unit configured to manage an execution of third party code in accordance with various aspects. As illustrated worker role unit can include processor component memory component relation component management component and operating component .

Similar to processor components and in resource management unit and compilation unit respectively processor component is configured to execute computer readable instructions related to performing any of a plurality of functions. Processor component can be a single processor or a plurality of processors dedicated to analyzing information to be communicated from worker role unit and or generating information that can be utilized by memory component relation component management component and or operating component . Additionally or alternatively processor component can be configured to control one or more components of worker role unit .

In another aspect memory component is coupled to processor component and configured to store computer readable instructions executed by processor component . Memory component can also be configured to store any of a plurality of other types of data including data generated by any of relation component management component and or operating component . Here it is noted that memory component is analogous to memory components and in resource management unit and compilation unit respectively. Accordingly it can be appreciated that any of the aforementioned features configurations of memory components and are also applicable to memory component .

As illustrated worker role unit can also include relation component . Within such embodiment relation component is configured to associate a third party code with a transform assembly. Here it is contemplated that transform assemblies are configured to retrieve data from a web service in an arbitrary form and transform the retrieved data into a common intermediate format.

In another aspect worker role unit includes management component which is configured to manage an execution of the third party code. Within such embodiment management component can be configured to execute different types of third party code to provide any of various transform assembly services. It should be noted that such services can include runtime services load time services and or on boarding services. For instance management component can be configured to execute third party code at runtime to provide a runtime service associated with a particular transform assembly. However management component can also be configured to execute third party code at load time to provide a load time service as well as at on boarding time to provide an on boarding time service.

Worker role unit can also include operating component . Within such embodiment operating component is configured to operate transform assemblies according to the third party code managed by management component . Moreover depending on the type of service facilitated by management component operating component can be configured to operate various transform assembly aspects including for example aspects directed towards a runtime service a load time service and or an on boarding time service. In a particular embodiment operating component can be configured to operate a billing aspect of a transform assembly based on third party code to facilitate billing content providers individually according to their desired suite of services.

The following description contains supplemental context regarding potential non limiting infrastructure architectures and or associated services to further aid in understanding one or more of the above embodiments. Any one or more of any additional features described in this section can be accommodated in any one or more of the embodiments described above with respect to updating of data set semantics and corresponding access APIs for information as a service from any platform. While such combinations of embodiments or features are possible for the avoidance of doubt no embodiments set forth in the subject disclosure are to be considered limiting on any other embodiments described herein.

By way of some additional background today while information can be obtained over networks such as the Internet today s offerings tend to the proprietary in terms of access and framework and are thus limited in terms of third party provider participation. For instance currently there is no adequate business model for commercial content providers to publish their data in a way that does not relinquish at least some of the value of such commercial content and thus historically owners of valuable content have tended to expose that content through limited proprietary means. Or in instances where storage of such content is provided by secure cloud storage providers there is little value in storage alone when a consumer wades through thousands of tables to potentially find an item of interest as a result. In addition even where cloud storage providers attempt to collect data from various providers at most such providers can only boast a modest small or incomplete catalog of data.

Much of the stunting of potential growth in this area has been the result of mistrust over handling and IP e.g. copyrights. In short big players don t trust cloud providers with crown jewels because a single compromise can end the value of the data. In addition such cloud providers to date have had a weak position with respect to information workers who wish to extract value from such data for their informational needs and in addition due to the proprietary nature of such systems developers have thus far had limited ability to expand tools for developing informational capabilities.

Accordingly as described for one or more embodiments an infrastructure for information as a service is provided that accommodates all classes of individuals publishers developers information workers and consumers. The infrastructure enables information discovery e.g. the ability to discover acquire and consume structured and blob datasets to power any application on any platform and any form factor e.g. any screen size. The infrastructure further enables brokerage business e.g. a partner driven ecosystem and global reach to deliver data and functionality to developers and information workers. The infrastructure also allows analytics and reporting e.g. a single click analysis to augment private data with public data. In this regard due to the open nature of various implementations of the infrastructure any application developer can develop mobile cloud and or desktop applications to facilitate the publishing processing querying and or retrieval of data.

To write applications one can register for account information e.g. sign in with Live ID and be provided with an account key by which to access the blob via structured and real time web services enabled for the infrastructure for information as a service as described for one or more embodiments herein. In one aspect developers can explore the APIs visually before coding begins. For instance a service explorer module or set of modules can be used by developers to visually construct representational state transfer REST API queries and preview the content according to a variety of packages such as but not limited to extensible markup language XML ATOM RAW for blob and real time content or in a table view e.g. for structured data. For example a developer merely provides his or her account key and selects to preview the content.

Accordingly developers can build mobile desktop or service applications on any platform. While resulting REST queries can be copied into a new developer application the infrastructure for information as a service also enables the ability to consume automatically generated C proxy classes to eliminate any need to create a local object model or generate and understand the details of XML or web service code. In this regard in another non limiting beneficial aspect a developer can download the proxy classes and include them in the developer s applications to consume service data with as few as a couple lines of code.

In this regard the various embodiments of an infrastructure for information as a service allow developers and information workers to find acquire and consume data in their applications and analytics scenarios instantly periodically or over some other function of time specified by the application developer. As mentioned a developer obtains an account key which then accompanies web services calls to the network services enabling information as a service as described for one or more embodiments herein for content requests and subscribing to the content of interest.

Thus in one aspect the account key provided by the infrastructure for information as a service as described for one or more embodiments herein is the developer s private key. This key enables billing and reporting on content used in connection with the developer s applications. As such this private developer key is not to be shared without purpose and precautions in securing the key are to be taken where developing native applications running on mobile or desktop solutions and planning to integrate the key as part of the deployment. For example cryptographic storage can be used to ensure the key is not cracked.

In addition to the account key which is used to track the application consuming the content the user ID can be a particular user ID that is a globalidentifier GID that represents the developer s individual users. This field allows billing for content that is priced on a per user basis programmatically. For example if a developer is developing a mobile application with an individual user consuming the application the developer returns the same GID each time requests are made on behalf of that individual user. However if the developer is developing a web portal and issuing web service requests on behalf of a variety of users it is up to the developer to assign a new GID for each user visiting the portal. For example each registered user can be assigned a GID or each IP address port combination can be assigned a user ID GID etc.

While REST APIs can be constructed on any platform to consume content from the infrastructure for information as a service as described for one or more embodiments herein in one embodiment proxy classes can be dynamically generated for services in C . Achieving this is a matter of downloading the object models adding them to the current developer project and updating the account and user values e.g. particular user values.

If a developer would like to issue requests manually an example is provided below but for any service the preview function can be used or the URLs created from the Service Explorer can be invoked as well. An exemplary non limiting REST query to a sample dataset is illustrated below. It is noted that some or all calls can be secure socket layer SSL secured.

The accountKey and uniqueUserld elements are also placed in the header of the request which appears as follows for example 

The value in accountKey represents the developer s account key found in the Accounts Tab and the value in uniqueUserID represents the GID for the user accessing the service.

The above example authenticating approach is non limiting in that other authenticating approaches are also possible and thus the various embodiments described herein can implement any alternative authentication approaches. For instance Basic Authorization RFC 1945 with the AccountKey as the password or Access Control Server ACS using a token based approach or other token based approaches can be used as well.

Accordingly the infrastructure for information as a service as described for one or more embodiments herein is a new service or framework allowing developers and information workers to easily discover purchase and manage premium data subscriptions in any platform. The infrastructure is an information marketplace that brings data imagery and real time web services from leading commercial data providers and authoritative public data sources as well as non authoritative publishers together into a single or multiple locations that are unified under a common provisioning and billing framework. Additionally developers and information workers can consume this premium content with virtually any platform application or business workflow.

Some exemplary non limiting scenarios for using the infrastructure for information as a service as described for one or more embodiments herein include a finding premium content to next generation killer apps for consumer and business scenarios b discovering and licensing valuable data to improve existing applications or reports c bringing disparate data sets together in innovative ways to gain new insight into business performance and processes e.g. aggregation algorithms d instantly and visually exploring APIs across all content providers for blob structured and real time web services and e consuming third party data inside existing applications and data base systems such as existing word processing spreadsheet database query systems etc. for rich reporting and analytics.

Benefits for developers include a trial subscriptions allow content to be investigated and applications to be developed without paying data royalties b simple transaction and subscription models allow pay as you go or grow access to multi million dollar datasets c consistent REST based APIs across datasets facilitate development on any platform d visually building and exploring APIs previewing results and e automatic C proxy classes provide instant object models and eliminate the need to write tedious XML and web service code.

Benefits for Information Workers include a integration with PowerPivot to easily work with data in existing spreadsheet software such as but not limited to Excel b simple predictable licensing models for acquiring content and c the ability to consume data from a structured query language SQL Server SQL Database and other pre existing assets.

Benefits for Content Partners include a easy publication and on boarding process regardless of blob data structured data or dynamic web services b developer tooling on the selected platform to ease development e.g. via.NET or other runtime system development c exposing developer content to global developer and information worker community d content discovery and integration inside pre existing content consumption applications and e a scalable cloud computing platform handles storage delivery billing and reporting on behalf of all parties.

In a non limiting implementation of the infrastructure for information as a service as described for one or more embodiments herein some features for Rich Web Services include a secure REST based model for consuming services across the entire content catalog b dynamic pagination built into the APIs to simplify access c Standard ATOM 1.0 feeds are available for most of the services and d consistent billing provisioning and usage reporting across all services.

In a non limiting implementation of the infrastructure for information as a service as described for one or more embodiments herein some features for a Service Explorer component include a C proxy classes generated to simplify development b preview of data in tabular form and as a feed such as an ATOM 1.0 feed if supported c invocation of the service to understand the results that the compiled service call returns d discovery of documentation and sample values for each of the parameters and e instant copying of the visually built URL for a service call into clipboard to ease development.

In a non limiting implementation of the infrastructure for information as a service as described for one or more embodiments herein some features for a Marketplace Integration and Discovery Portal component include a discovery of new data across domains including consumers and businesses b management of service subscriptions and usage limits c management of account keys to access the services and d detailed access reporting containing the services datasets that were accessed grouped by date and by account key.

The infrastructure provides a variety of value propositions for content owners application developers ISVs and for information workers and other consumers subscribers. For content owners the infrastructure enables monetization from data for data providers who charge for the data in addition to social benefits for data providers who do not charge for data but derive benefit from the publication of such data in other ways. Due to the openness of the infrastructure content owners enjoy greater availability and reach of data to ISVs and consumers information workers and all of this comes at a lower cost particularly over developing a proprietary model as in the past.

For application developers ISVs the infrastructure enables access to data in a consistent format variable and low cost pricing model for data access. predictable pricing profit potential from consumers IWs using the applications built using the data broader reach to consumers through any platform and a single billing and data source

For information workers consumers the infrastructure enables added value from applications consumption of data in current large object LOB or IW software a variable and low cost pricing model for data access in addition to a single billing and data source.

Accordingly the infrastructure solves a current customer and developer pain point with a potentially significant revenue upside creates business intelligence opportunities attached with instant data for modeling reporting analysis and trending and creates adoption and stickiness for any platform by encouraging data owners to store their data via the infrastructure thereby differentiating the infrastructure s value proposition when compared with conventional cloud storage environments.

As shown in the flow diagram of at described herein are various ways for content owners or publishers to publish data via the infrastructure. At there are a variety of tools that allow developers to developer applications for consuming the data via the infrastructure. At consumers or information workers use the applications or can directly query over the data to consume the data. Lastly the infrastructure provides a rich variety of tools at that enable automatic administration auditing billing etc. on behalf of all parties in the content chain enabled by the transaction model.

In this regard some key parties in the infrastructure include data owners the application developers ISVs and the consumers information workers. In general data owners are entities who want to charge for data or who want to provide data for free for other reasons or enforce other conditions over the data. In turn application developers ISVs are entities who want to monetize their application e.g. through advertising direct payments indirect payments etc. or provide their application for free for some beneficial reason to such entities. Information workers and consumers are those who can use the raw data or those who want to use an application provided by the application developers.

In this regard various embodiments for the user friendly data platform for enabling information as a service from any platform is an infrastructure to enable consumers of data IWs developers ISVs and consumers of data to transact in a simple cost effective and convenient manner. The infrastructure democratizes premium private and community public data in an affordable way to allow IWs to draw insights rapidly allows developers to build innovative apps using multiple sources of data in a creative manner and enables developers to monetize their efforts on any platform. For instance the infrastructure supports Pay Per Use as well as Subscription Pricing for Content Pay for Content retail price set by content owner Pay Data Fee Shipping and Handling and BW and further supports Data fees as a brokerage fee on a per logical transaction basis per report per API per download etc. .

For Information Workers e.g. Office SQL Server Dynamics users the infrastructure supports subscriptions to allow for future EA integration as well as predictable spend requirements as well as caching to support on and off premise BI as well as HPC workloads . Thus alternatives include content priced per user per month which may or may not bundle to deliver content packs or per transaction pricing e.g. allowing cloud reporting business intelligence on demand pricing to eliminate the need to move large amounts of data while allowing per usage pricing or vertical apps via report galleries.

For content providers any data type any cloud using any platform the infrastructure becomes a value proposition to incent sales within any particular desired platform auto scaling higher level SLA possibilities at no additional cost. For some non limiting examples data can be secure and associated data in the following domains Location aware services data Commercial and residential real estate Financial data and services etc. A non limiting scenario can include delivery of data to top 30 non governmental organization NGO datasets. In addition the infrastructure can include the ability to showcase BI visualization through Bing for information as a service HPC etc. Vertical application opportunities exist as well.

In one non limiting embodiment the data brokerage can be analogized to conventional brick and mortar strategies For instance capacity can be represented as shelf space e.g. a mix of structured and unstructured blob data cost of goods COGS can be represented as square footage SA platform dependency bandwidth and content can be represented as merchandise e.g. optimize content providers to cover COGS maximize profits from IWs and developers . In various embodiments an onboarding process can be implemented with quality bars for data and services as well as accommodation of service level agreements SLAB .

As supplemental services to the data billing and discovery services can include online billing e.g. MOCP or discovery services e.g. pinpoint and authentication services can include credentials management e.g. Live ID or content authentication e.g. authenticated content services ACS . Accounts services can include logging audit services or account management . Management and operations services can include an operations dashboard service and network operations service e.g. Gomez.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that network interactions and information services can be practiced with a variety of computer system configurations and protocols. In this regard one non limiting implementation for querying and updating data that can be used in one or more embodiments described herein is the Open Data Protocol OData .

OData is a web protocol for querying and updating data. OData applies web technologies such as HyperText Transfer Protocol HTTP Atom Publishing Protocol AtomPub and JavaScript Object Notation JSON to provide access to information from a variety of applications services and stores. For some general background OData emerged organically based on the experiences implementing AtomPub clients and servers in a variety of products over the past several years. OData can be used to expose and access information from a variety of sources including but not limited to relational databases file systems content management systems and traditional web sites. OData has been released under the Open Specification Promise OSP to allow anyone to freely interoperate with OData implementations in order to encourage growth of the ecosystem. Features of OData can be incorporated into other protocols as well to form hybrid protocols with similar functionality for querying and updating network data.

OData is consistent with the way the web works. In one aspect OData uses universal resource identifiers URIs as a way to identify resources and uses an HTTP centric protocol with a uniform interface for interacting with those resources e.g. similar to the way that the Internet works. In one non limiting aspect OData builds on the conventions over HTTP popularized by AtomPub which have simplified the process of sharing data content and information across independently developed systems. OData defines additional conventions that implementations can optionally implement to support basic query and schema information to be exchanged. To simplify integration with HTML and JavaScript clients OData defines an optional JSON representation of the protocol that complements the XML based AtomPub format. As one can appreciate additional implementation specific or other details regarding the OData protocol can be found at www.odata.org.

One of ordinary skill in the art can appreciate that the various embodiments of methods and devices for an infrastructure for information as a service from any platform and related embodiments described herein can be implemented in connection with any computer or other client or server device which can be deployed as part of a computer network or in a distributed computing environment and can be connected to any kind of data store.
