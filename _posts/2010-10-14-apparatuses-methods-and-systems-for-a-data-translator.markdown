In one embodiment the Data Translator server may communicate with the call center via the communication network . In one implementation the Data Translator may send contact strategies to call center for execution. For example the Data Translator server may instruct the call center to contact a specific consumer based on a series of determined rules strategies e.g. contact time contact method and or the like as will be further illustrated in and A B. In one implementation the call center may establish automatic robot calling emails to contact a consumer based on the contact strategies.

In one embodiment the Data Translator server may also communicate with a Data Translator database . In some embodiments a Data Translator server may be integrated with a local Data Translator database . In other embodiments a Data Translator server may access a remote Data Translator database via the communication network . The Data Translator server may send the information to the database for storage such as but not limited to consumer account information consumer contactability analysis results consumer specific contact strategy program information and or the like. The Data Translator database may also provide the Data Translator server with information relating to system information hardware upgrade information security tracking data and or the like.

In one embodiment the Data Translator database may be integrated with a data source and housed with the Data Translator server as a local database. In another embodiment the Data Translator database may be configured to remotely access and synchronize with the data source via network connections. In one implementation the Data Translator server may configure the Data Translator database to periodically retrieve consumer data from the data source and integrate translate the obtained data into the Data Translator database as will be further illustrated in .

In one embodiment a system administrator may communicate with the Data Translator server and the Data Translator database for regular maintenance service failure system updates database renewal and or the like. In one embodiment the system administrator may directly operate with the Data Translator server and the Data Translator database on an in house basis such as but not limited to via an integrated administrator user interface. In another embodiment the system administrator may remotely access the Data Translator server and the Data Translator database and perform its functionality via the communication network . In one implementation the system administrator may configure the consumer data universal variables data syntax and save it to the Data Translator system. In one implementation the system administrator may be part of the business solution management of the program e.g. a product campaign debt service etc. .

In one embodiment the Data Translator controller may be housed separately from other components and or databases within the Data Translator system while in another embodiment some or all of the other modules and or databases may be housed within and or configured as part of the Data Translator controller. Further detail regarding implementations of Data Translator controller operations modules and databases is provided below.

In the implementation illustrated in the Data Translator controller may be configured to couple to external entities via a communications interface and a user interface . In various implementations the communications interface may for example serve to configure data into application transport network media access control and or physical layer formats in accordance with a network transmission protocol such as but not limited to FTP S TCP IP SMTP Short Message Peer to Peer SMPP and or the like. For example the communications interface may be configured for receipt and or transmission of data to an external and or network database. The communications interface may further be configurable to implement and or translate Wireless Application Protocol WAP VoIP and or the like data formats and or protocols. The communications interface may further house one or more ports jacks antennas and or the like to facilitate wired and or wireless communications with and or within the Data Translator system. In one embodiment the user interface may for example receive and configure operational commands indications from a user e.g. a call center representative etc. to the Data Translator secured user account information user submitted configuration data and or the like. In one implementation the user interface may include but not limited to devices such as keyboard s mouse stylus es touch screen s digital display s and or the like.

In one embodiment the Data Translator controller may further be coupled to a plurality of modules configured to implement Data Translator functionality and or services. The plurality of modules may in one embodiment be configurable to implement a Data Translator application which may automatically develop and execute contact strategies based on consumer data analysis. Within embodiments the Data Translator may periodically constantly or intermittently monitor all the data sources e.g. the DataDepot databases etc. and scan for new consumer information from the DataDepot . In one implementation the DataDepot database may be data sources provided by a client e.g. an enterprise etc. by a third party e.g. Lexus Experian credit company etc. and or by an internal database of a call center. For example the DataDepot database may be an FTP online database a web based data service and or the like.

In one embodiment the Data Translator system may comprise components such as but not limited to a Task Scheduler a Data Translator a Matching Engine a Scoring Engine a Strategy Engine an Execution Engine and or the like. In one embodiment the Task Scheduler may schedule a series of Data Translator activities and or functionalities. For example in one implementation the Task Scheduler may schedule the Data Translator Translate database and Data Translator to update with DataDepot database periodically e.g. every two hours etc. and the Scoring Engine may be scheduled to update the scoring record accordingly 22 hours a day. In one implementation the SC Dailer database may be scheduled to generate Phone Export files every 90 minutes and Business Solution files upon completion of Strategy Engine . In one implementation the Task Scheduler may schedule the Matching Engine to resort to a third party data service to validate consumer information within 2 48 hours delay. In another implementation the Task Scheduler may schedule all the Data Translator activities discussed above on demand. For example if the Data Translator receives a request from the user interface to update the Data Translator database with the DataDepot database the Task Scheduler may facilitate the Data Translator and Translate database to perform the synchronization immediately upon request. Such triggering may occur periodically at specified times dynamically on demand triggered and or the like.

In one embodiment the Matching Engine may operate with the Translate database and Data Translator to update records of new accounts. In one implementation the Translate Database may periodically update consumer data with a DataDepot database and generate a temporary list of new consumer accounts. For example in one implementation consumer data may be downloaded into the Translate database by the Data Translator in a variety of data formats such as excel spreadsheets XML Java and or the like. In one implementation the Matching Engine may retrieve the list of new consumer accounts and process the new accounts to determine whether the new account is associated with an existing consumer. For example the Matching Engine may form a query based on the universal variable associated with the new account and search a database of existing consumers. In one implementation the Translate database may delete the temporary new accounts list when the data translation process is accomplished.

In one embodiment the Data Translator may access the temporary list generated by the Translate database to integrate the new accounts data into the Data Translator database . For example in one implementation if a new account is determined to be associated with an existing consumer by the Matching Engine the Data Translator may retrieve and store the new consumer data e.g. a new account name a new account password a new telephone number a new email address etc. in the Data Translator database associated with the corresponding entries in the Phones database the Consumers database and the Accounts database . In another implementation if no match with any existing consumer is found for a new account the Data Translator may generate new entries in the Data Translator database to store the new account. The data translation integration process described above may be further illustrated in .

In one embodiment the Scoring Engine may analyze and evaluate the contactability of each consumer as will be further illustrated in . In one implementation the Scoring Engine may periodically perform the scoring procedure as scheduled by the Task Scheduler e.g. every 2 3 hours. In another implementation the Scoring Engine may be launched by user demand or by receiving an indication of Data Translator database updates from the Data Translator . In one implementation the Scoring Engine may analyze the consumer profile and contact history to calculate a successful contact attempt probability. In one implementation the Scoring Engine may communicate with a third party service via the communications interface to obtain additional consumer information such as consumer credit history purchase history and or the like.

For example the Scoring Engine may calculate a successful contact probability of each telephone number on record with a consumer. For another example the Scoring Engine may calculate a payment willingness probability of a consumer e.g. the probability that the consumer will be persuaded to pay via a variety of contact methods such as but not limited to telephone call email letter instant messaging and or the like. For another example the Scoring Engine may estimate the financial ability of a consumer e.g. a range of payment amount that a consumer may commit to within a specified period of time and or the like.

In one embodiment the Strategy Engine and the Execution Engine may devise and execute consumer specific contact strategies based on the contactability evaluation. For example in one implementation the Strategy Engine may determine to contact a consumer via phone call email or instant messaging at a specific time of a day based on the maximum successful contact probability of each contact method. For another example the Strategy Engine may determine the time the consumer and contact method based on an expected payment amount. For another example the Strategy Engine may assign a consumer contact task to a call center based on the successful contact statistics. For another example the Strategy Engine may determine a set of rules with regard to contacting a specific consumer e.g. dialing at a home number for weekends dialing at a cellphone number at night times and or the like. In another implementation universal variables of consumer data entries may be leveraged in strategy making e.g. the consumer demographic geographic and personal information the corresponding program e.g. product campaign etc. information may be considered and evaluated etc.

In one implementation the Execution Engine may execute the developed contact strategy. In one implementation an auto dialer may be instantiated. For example the auto dialer may make pre recorded robot calls send emails or instant messages to a consumer based on the contact strategy. For another example the Execution Engine may generate and display a graphic user interface showing the contact strategy and a call center operator may interfere with the auto dialing process e.g. to adjust the calling strategy in real time physically operate phone calls emails and or the like.

In one embodiment the Data Translator controller may further be coupled to one or more databases configured to store and or maintain Data Translator data. A Consumers database may contain information pertaining to consumer account information contact information profile information identities of hardware devices Customer Premise Equipments CPEs and or the like associated with consumers account preferences consumer configurations system settings and or the like. A hardware database may contain information pertaining to hardware devices with which the Data Translator system may communicate such as but not limited to Email servers user telephony devices CPEs gateways routers user terminals and or the like. The hardware database may specify transmission protocols data formats and or the like suitable for communicating with hardware devices employed by any of a variety of Data Translator affiliated entities. A Strategy database may contain data pertaining to consumer contact strategies and associated programs. In one embodiment the Strategy database may maintain a list of consumers to be contacted and the phone number time contact methods contact frequency expected payment amount for each consumer and or the like. For example the consumer strategy list may include fields such as but not limited to consumer ID consumer name consumer phone numbers consumer addresses consumer email addresses program code program name preferred contact number priority level program start time program end time contact frequency and or the like.

The Data Translator database may be implemented using various standard data structures such as an array hash linked list struct structured text file e.g. XML table and or the like. For example in one embodiment the XML for a Consumers List in the Consumers database may take a form similar to the following example 

In one embodiment the Data Translator may access the Data Translator databases to retrieve and update consumer information based on the program information . Form example the Data Translator may associate the program ID and related program information with the target consumers e.g. the debtors etc. .

In one embodiment the Data Translator may load and retrieve updated client data from DataDepot database . As discussed above the DataDepot database may be an external enterprise provided database of consumer e.g. debtor etc. information a call center database comprising caller information and or the like. In one implementation the Data Translator may be scheduled to periodically synchronize and update data with the DataDepot database e.g. every 2 hours etc. In one implementation the Data Translator may search for and translate integrate new consumer data into the Data Translator database as will be further illustrated in . In one implementation the Data Translator may further access third party data service and verify the new consumer data as will be further illustrated in .

In one embodiment the Data Translator may generate consumer contactability scores and liquidity scores to estimate the efficiency to contact a consumer and an affordable amount of money that the consumer is able to pay. In one implementation the Data Translator may obtain external vendor information from a third party service e.g. LexusNexus Experian etc. internal consumer payment history and client provided information and or the like to perform the scoring as will be further illustrated in A F.

In one embodiment the Data Translator may devise calling strategy to contact a consumer based on the consumer contactability and liquidity scores and execute the calling strategy . In one implementation the Data Translator may generate a prioritized list of contact numbers and make automatic robot calls through the list. In another implementation the Data Translator may generate robot calls to consumers with regard to a probability distribution. In another implementation the Data Translator may transfer the calling requests to a call center representative and display a user interface for contacting consumers. In one implementation the Data Translator may record the call history into an internal call database and generate call history report. The call strategy development and execution will be further illustrated in .

In one embodiment the Data Translator may generate business solution report based on the calling strategy execution. For example in one implementation the Data Translator may summarize the calling history of the contact strategy and automatically generate a business report comprising an analysis of the contact success failure rates.

In an alternative embodiment the Data Translator may periodically synchronize and update with the client DataDepot database. In one implementation the Data Translator may stamp the time and date of each periodic synchronization and form a SQL query based on the timestamp of the latest synchronization on the loaded list of available consumer accounts from the client DataDepot database. In that case the Data Translator may generate a list of new consumer accounts that have been updated in the client database since the latest synchronization e.g. a NewAccounts table.

In one embodiment the Data Translator may automatically extract data from a database based on data storage formats as further illustrated in .

For every new consumer account on the list the Data Translator may generate a match key to form a query on the Consumers table in the Data Translator database . In one embodiment the consumers data stored in various databases associated with a universal variable and the match key may be generated based on the universal variable associated with each consumer record. For example the match key may be based on a consumer s demographic profile and the Data Translator may attempt to match against existing consumer match keys in a consumer demography table.

In one embodiment if a match is found the Data Translator may integrate the consumer account data into the Data Translator database. For example the Data Translator may associate information of the new account with the existing consumer data entry in the Consumers database e.g. adding the account name and account information etc.

In one embodiment if no match is found at the Data Translator may place the new account into a NewAccounts Table in the Data Translator database and create a new entry for the new consumer associated with the new account in the Consumers database . In one implementation the Data Translator may add the created new consumer to the ConsumerDemo Table in the Consumers database . Upon integration updated consumer data into the ConsumerDemo Table the Data Translator may update the Phone Buffer with the Phone Number associated with the new account as will be further illustrated in . In one embodiment after finishing integrating the new accounts the Data Translator may release the temporary storage of new accounts in the Translate database.

For example in one implementation for every updated consumer record the Data Translator may send the consumer name address and social security number SSN etc. associated with a new account to LexusNexus for verification. For example in one implementation the Data Translator may form a query based on the consumer s SSN and retrieve the associated data record based on the query to compare the received consumer information with the LexusNexus sourced consumer record. In one implementation example code for a SQL query to retrieve consumer information based on a consumer s SSN may be similar to the following form 

If the consumer data matches any of a LexusNexus sourced name address SSN etc. the consumer data is validated for storage in the Consumer database . Otherwise if there is no match returned from LexusNexus the new account may be deleted from the Consumer database . In a further implementation if the consumer data is valid e.g. the consumer name address and SSN match with LexusNexus record the third party may associate additional information from the third party databases and return to the Data Translator databases e.g. additional phone numbers etc.

In one implementation the Data Translator may obtain external vendor information from a third party data service entity such as LexusNexus Experian credit rating agencies mortgage provider and or the like. The Data Translator may obtain data such as consumer credit information vendor creditability consumer demographics information and or the like and feed into the scoring module. For example in one implementation for an individual consumer the credit history may be considered to analyze the ability of the consumer to provide payment. In one implementation the credibility of a vendor i.e. the source of information LexusNexus Experian client others etc. may be leveraged. For example in one implementation to score the contactability an individual consumer based on a specific phone number if the phone number is obtained from a reliable source such as LexusNexus etc. it may be considered high reliability. Otherwise if the phone number is fed by random Internet search e.g. Google search etc. the phone number may be associated with a low reliability score. In one implementation the consumer demographics information may include information such as but not limited to neighborhood income data and or the like.

In one embodiment the Data Translator may retrieve internal consumer history as an input to the scoring module including the contact history and payment history of an individual consumer. For example in one implementation the contact history may include a series of contact attempts and the phone number the contact time the contact dial outcome and or the like associated with each contact attempt. In one implementation the contact dial outcome may be a right party contact RPC i.e. the consumer is successfully reached by the dialing party or busy i.e. the line is busy or unreachable i.e. consumer unavailability no body answer the dial or Voice Wrong Number VWN i.e. the dial fails due to wrong phone number and or the like or other party i.e. the consumer is reached by a dial attempt made from parties other than the dialing party . For example in one implementation the Data Translator may adopt a log module such as Asterisk and or the like to generate call log files to record the call history which may take a form similar to the following 

For another example in one implementation the payment history may include a series of payment events by an individual consumer such as the payment date the payment amount the payment condition e.g. spontaneous or followed on a contact attempt etc. and or the like.

In one embodiment the Data Translator may obtain client supplied information . For example in one implementation for debt service the Data Translator may obtain an amount of debt associated with an individual consumer the term of the debt and or the like.

In one embodiment the obtained and retrieved information may be processed by a scoring module and the Data Translator may calculated at least two scores associated with each consumer a contactability score and a liquidity score . In one implementation the contactability score may take a form similar to a probability value of successfully contacting a consumer based on a specified phone number on the next dial attempt ProbContact . In one implementation the ProbContact may be a constant value between 0 and 1 indicating an average successful contact probability. In another implementation the ProbContact may depend on variables such as the contact time of a day the contact day of a week and or the like. In a further implementation the ProbContact may be coupled with combinatorial contact logics e.g. the successful contact probability of consecutive dialing attempts of the one or more phone numbers associated with an individual consumer etc.

In one embodiment the liquidity score may indicate the cash payment ability of an individual consumer. The liquidity score may include scores such as but not limited to M30 the amount of cash payment a consumer is able to provide in a 30 day time period MaxCash the maximum cash payment a consumer is able to provide in total ProbCure the probability that the amount in debt will cure its own i.e. the debtor will just repay the debt without being contacted and or the like.

In one embodiment for each dial category the Data Translator may build a consumer phone contactability regression model and regress the associated coefficients and standard error based on which a score is calculated for each category based on the regressed coefficients . In one implementation the Data Translator may calculate the ProbContact based on a weighted sum of the scores per category . are further illustrated in .

In one embodiment the consumer scoring is a dynamic model wherein the scores will get updated after each additional dial attempt. For example in one implementation the Data Translator may update the consumer dial history and re calculate the consumer contactability scores if it is determined that new dial record is loaded. For another example in one implementation the Data Translator may be scheduled to update consumer dial history and perform the consumer scoring periodically e.g. every hour etc.

In one implementation the Data Translator may employ regression techniques to calculate consumer contactability predictor coefficients coefficients standard errors . For example in one implementation the SAS code for obtaining regression coefficients of a linear regression formula may be similar to the following form

In alternative embodiments the Data Translator may adopt other regression models such as double log regression and or the like. In one embodiment the data entries z and P z indicate a confidence in the prediction by regression.

In one implementation the Data Translator may generate a score for each category on the tables by multiplying the coefficient and the input consumer phone dial attempt value. In one implementation the Data Translator may calculate the ProbContact via taking a weighted sum of the generated scores per category. For example in one implementation the formula to calculate ProbContact may take a form similar to 

where the calculated ProbContact is a value within 0 1 indicating the probability of a right party contact outcome on the next dial attempt.

In one embodiment the Data Translator may calculate liquidity scores associated with a consumer based on regression models similar to that of calculating the ProbContact. For example in one implementation the Data Translator may determine regression coefficients for M30 MaxCash and ProbCure based on the payment history data of a specific consumer and generate estimates for each consumer by regression models similar to those described in . For example in one implementation the Data Translator may analyze the payment history and categorize data such as but not limited to the total amount in debt payment amount within 30 days without being contacted payment amount within 30 days after being contacted payment amount within 60 days without being contacted payment amount within 60 days after being contacted payment amount within 90 days without being contacted payment amount within 90 days after being contacted zip code prior presence in debt program default presence and or the like. In one implementation the Data Translator may calculate regression coefficients of each category in a similar manner as described in and determine an estimate for M30 MaxCash and ProbCure based on the coefficients. In a further implementation the Data Translator may determine liquidity scores such as M60 the estimated payment amount that the consumer is able to provide within 60 days and M90 the estimated payment amount that the consumer is able to provide within 90 days .

In some cases there may not be sufficient historical data of debt payment associated with a consumer. For example a consumer may be involved in a debt program for the first time or have only been involved for a few times. In such cases the past debt payment history may not establish enough samples for regression models. In an alternative embodiment the Data Translator may calculate M30 and MaxCash by stochastic models. For example in one implementation the Data Translator may subtract an average income value based on the demographic information of a consumer by an estimated average expenses value categorized by consumer address to obtain an estimate of the payment capability.

In one embodiment the Data Translator may develop dialing strategies based on the calculated consumer contactability scores and liquidity scores. In one embodiment the Data Translator may generate a prioritized list of consumer phone numbers and automatically dial down the list. For example for a set of consumers needed to be contacted for a program the Data Translator may sort all numbers associated with the consumers based on the contactability and liquidity scores to generate a prioritized list.

In one implementation the Data Translator may retrieve an optimization model template which may take a form similar to the following 

where the function U priority weights indicates an objective and W ProbContact Liquidity priority weights indicates an expected amount of payment based on the parameters ProbContact and liquidity scores and the variable priority weights. For example in one implementation the U priority weights may take a form similar to a weighted logarithm utility function 

In one implementation the Data Translator may employ non linear e.g. programming algorithms to solve the optimization problem and obtain a set of optimal priority weights . For example optimization algorithms such as but not limited to Newton s method gradient descent method bisection algorithm and or the like may be employed.

In one embodiment the Data Translator may re sort the list of phone numbers based on the calculated set of optimal priority weights and make dialer calls based on the prioritized listing of phone numbers .

In one embodiment the Data Translator may apply a dialing rule filter to the dialing listing. For example in one implementation the filter may specify dialing rules to determine which numbers should not be dialed as further illustrated in .

In an alternative embodiment instead of dialing down a list of phone numbers the Data Translator may perform a probabilistic dialing procedure. shows a logic flow diagram illustrating aspects of automatic dialing strategy based on probabilistic dialing in one embodiment of the Data Translator. For example in one implementation the Data Translator may select to dial one consumer based on a probability distribution where the associated probability distribution is determined by the calculated consumer contactability scores and liquidity scores.

As shown in in one embodiment the Data Translator may determine a dialing probability weight for each phone number denoted by W W W . . . . For example in one implementation the dialing probability weights may be a set of near and or optimal solutions to the optimization problem at . For another example in one implementation the dialing probability weights may be calculated via a predetermined function e.g. Priority Weight Contactability Probability Max30 etc. In one implementation the Data Translator may calculate probability threshold values based on the probability priority weights denoted by T T T . . . such that T

In one embodiment the Data Translator may periodically e.g. every 5 minutes etc. generate a uniformly distributed random variable u 0 1 . For example in one implementation the C implementation of generating a uniformly distributed random variable between 0 and 1 may take a form similar to 

In an alternative embodiment the Data Translator may generate random variable and make automatic dials based on other probability distributions such as exponential distribution Poisson distribution normal distribution and or the like.

In one embodiment the probabilistic dialing may keep running unless the Data Translator receives an indication to stop . For example in one implementation a system operator may determine to stop calling one consumer if the consumer has already paid the debt. In that case the Data Translator may remove the phone numbers associated with the consumer from the dialing list and re calculating weights and thresholds for probabilistic dialing.

In alternative embodiments the Data Translator may generate a prioritized dialing list based on predetermined rules. For example in one implementation phone numbers associated with a shorted remaining time period to the due date of the program may be ranked higher. For another example in one implementation priority information of clients and programs may also be considered in determining the dialing list. In one implementation the pre determined rules may be submitted by a system operator via a user interface.

In a further embodiment the Data Translator may combine automatic robot calls with call center representatives. For example in one implementation the Data Translator may allocate phone numbers to different call centers based on a series of factors such as consumer demographics call representative availability client preferences and or the like. In one implementation the Data Translator may allocate a phone number dial attempt to a call center representative based on predetermined rules. For example in one implementation a call center representative may receive a request to talk to a consumer if the consumer is successfully reached by a robot call and request representative service.

In an alternative embodiment the Data Translator may make robot calls based on pre recorded dialogues. For example in one implementation if a consumer is connected over the phone call the Data Translator may automatically play a segment of pre recorded individual debt information to the consumer and inquire the consumer whether he or she is willing to pay the debt by articulating Yes or No. The Data Translator may then analyze and extract information from the consumer indication from the phone call and determine the next step strategy.

In one embodiment as shown in the Data Translator may ask the consumer to pay the total desired payment amount . If the consumer submitted an answer of Yes the Data Translator may provide payment option to the consumer . For example in one implementation the consumer may choose to articulate a credit card number or deposit account number over the line to manually enter a credit card number or deposit account number e.g. via IVR or to speak with a call center representative. In one implementation the Data Translator may proceed with consumer payment .

In one embodiment if the consumer submitted an answer of No at the Data Translator may inquire whether the consumer is able to pay an amount based on the liquidity score . For example in one implementation the Data Translator may ask the consumer to pay an amount equivalent to M30 and indicates that the consumer will not be reached again within 30 days once he or she makes the payment of M30. Similarly the Data Translator may provide an option for the consumer to pay an amount equivalent to M90.

If the consumer submits a positive answer the Data Translator may proceed with . Otherwise the Data Translator may keep inquiring the consumer for a minimum payment amount . For example in one implementation the minimum payment amount may be determined by the debt program associated with the consumer which may be an amount that has to be made to avoid penalty. If the consumer gives a negative answer at the Data Translator may inform the consumer of regulatory policies e.g. related regulatory policies and potential penalties of failing to pay.

In one embodiment if the consumer hangs up the call in the middle of a conversation with the Data Translator the Data Translator may determine re dial strategies based on the timing of call interruption. For example in one implementation if the consumer quits the call without submitting any response e.g. at the Data Translator may return to and proceed with the probabilistic dialing. For another example if the line is unintentionally interrupted due to consumer mis operation poor connection and or the like e.g. the call is terminated after the consumer submitting a first response at the Data Translator may re dial the phone number immediately. In one embodiment the Data Translator will retain its current state in the consumer response dialogue redial the consumer provide a message apologizing for the disconnection and proceed where the dialogue left off by moving to the last unanswered response question i.e. returning to its saved state .

In one embodiment the Data Translator includes facilities for thin client virtualization and application tailoring based on user identities and or profiles. In one implementation a Data Translator computing environment may include a local office and or collection of client terminals wherein each client terminal operated by a user may comprise a thin client. In one implementation the thin client may have no operating system initially installed. The computing environment may further include a projection server communicatively coupled to the plurality of client terminals in the local office. In one implementation the projection server may be situated locally with respect to the plurality of client terminals . In one implementation the projection server may comprise a plurality of servers configured as a cloud computing facility. The computing environment may further include a central office facility comprising one or more data and or authentication servers . A data server in the central office may maintain and or provide access to a central database which may include master copies of one or more operating systems applications data files and or database tables and or the like. In one implementation the data server may supply a so called Golden Master or Golden Image to the projection server such as on a periodic basis whenever requested by the projection server whenever updates are made and or the like. The Golden Image may in one implementation include an operating system destined for installation on one or more client terminals. The Golden Master may include additional files as well in various implementations such as an authentication application seed and or compressed files for other applications .NET framework files and or the like. The data server may further provide a plurality of application files application file updates data values and or updates and or the like to the projection server which may be destined for installation and or use on one or more of the client terminals. The projection server may store received application files data and or the like in a projection server database . In one implementation the data server may directly exchange data with one or more client terminals including updated data values records stored in the central database and or the like. In one implementation application files may be virtualized prior to installation on the client terminals. In one implementation application virtualization may be achieved using VMWare Thinapp. In one implementation application virtualization occurs after application files are received at the projection server. In an alternative implementation application files are virtualized at the central office and virtualized application files are then provided to the projection server.

At power on a client terminal may be configured to boot from a communications network instead of from any local disk. In one implementation a Preboot Execution Environment PXE boot may be engaged to boot the client terminal from the network wherein the client polls for contains and or is provided an address on the network to obtain boot information and or to send a boot request. The client terminal s boot request may be relayed to the projection server which in turn may provide elements of the Golden Image such as operating system files application and or authentication seed files .NET framework files and or the like for installation at the client terminal. Authentication seed files may then allow a user to submit authentication information in order to identify the user and or initiate provision of further files and or application use authorizations. In one implementation the client terminal may be equipped with one or more biometric login devices e.g. fingerprint and or palmprint scanner retina scanner facial recognition scanner earshape recognition scanner voice recorder typing rhythm analyzer and or the like configured to admit biometric data associated with a user . In one example embodiment a Digital Persona U.are.U. Fingerprint Reader is employed which captures an image of the users fingerprint converts it to a binary format and provides it via a Digital Persona service to the Authentication Control Server server for authentication. In one implementation software used to engage the one or more biometric login devices is provided from the Golden Image by the projection server to the client terminal after a boot request is made. In one implementation other authentication measures may be used in place of and or in addition to biometric authentication such as use of a password key device secret question and or the like.

The user may engage the biometric login device and or any other authentication measures to submit user identification information to an authentication server such as may be located at a central office . The authentication server may then verify and or authenticate the user identification information such as by comparing it against stored user identification information e.g. as may be stored in a central database ensuring a match beyond a specified threshold and or the like. If a match is detected the authentication server may query a database e.g. the central database for a matching user s profile to determine user access authorizations contained therein such as a package of applications that should be provided to the user. In one implementation the Data Translator may employ Microsoft Active Directory for administration of user access and authorizations which may run on the Data Server. Based on the user identifier ID and or information in an associated user profile the Data Translator may determine one or more applications that the user is permitted to access. In one implementation the applications a user may access may be correlated with one or more of a user s company a user s department a user s employment position a user s location a user s assignment and or the like. The authentication server may provide an instruction to the projection server to provide authorized application files to the client terminal at which the user is logged in. In turn the projection server may provide application files such as in the form of executable virtualized application files to the client terminal at which the user is logged in. In one implementation the user my be required to periodically re enter login and or authentication information to ensure that they are still the user of that client terminal and that another user has not taken their place.

A client terminal may be booted such as on machine startup to initiate a network e.g. PXE boot passing a boot request over the network such as to the projection server . The projection server in turn may monitor and or determine whether a boot request has been received . If not the projection server may wait for a period of time before checking again for a boot request . In one embodiment the boot request may be configured in accordance with the Preboot Execution Environment PXE Specification v.2.1 standard.

Once the request is received the projection server may pass files and or data to the client terminal such as by employing HP Image Manager. In one implementation the projection server may provide all or aspects of the Golden Image to the client terminal such as operating system files .NET framework files Java files and or the like application seed files authentication and or login input e.g. biometric files and or the like. The client starts the boot process and begins to copy and unpackage the materials provided from the projection server. Using files received from the projection server which have now been executed instantiated a user at the client terminal may login and or otherwise generate a user ID . In one implementation the user ID generated at comprises a biometric user ID such as but not limited to a thumbprint or scan a print or scan of any other finger combination of fingers part of the palm and or the like an iris or retina scan facial image scan earshape image scan voice audio data and or the like. For example one of the packages received at the thin client may be DigitalPersona Pro and or other thumbprint device drivers and capture programs. The generated user ID may then be passed to the authentication and or data server s e.g. by sending it via FTP HTTP Post SSH FTPS SFTP HTTPS another Digital Persona service and or the like which may then determine whether the received ID is valid . For example the send message may include an image converted to binary format and may be sent to a server side component of DigitalPersona Pro fingerprint authentication application which will perform the recognition identification of the biometric identifier. In one implementation this determination may be made based on a comparison of the received ID with stored IDs stored ID formatting information and or the like. If the user ID is determined to be invalid at an error handling procedure may be undertaken a request may be transmitted for reentry and or retransmission of the user ID information and or the like .

For valid user IDs the authentication and or data server s may access user information and or a user profile associated with the user ID . Accessed user information may then be used to determine which applications to include in a tailored application package for that user . For example in one implementation a user profile may have fields identifying authorized applications for that user. In another implementation profile fields may be compared with application access fields defined separately for the applications and those applications having appropriately matching fields with the user profile may be selected for that user. For example a user profile and or other user information may in one implementation identify a department code program code and or the like structured syntax string associated with the user e.g. as may be see in and various applications may also have associations with various department codes program codes and or the like. The authentication and or data server s may then in this implementation instruct provision applications sharing one or more department codes program codes and or the like with those of the user to the user s client terminal. In one implementation some or all of the determination of which applications to provide to the user may take place at the projection server and the authentication and or data server s may provide sufficient information to the projection server to allow it to complete the identification of user appropriate applications.

Once the appropriate package of applications is determined for the user the authentication and or data server s may pass an instruction message to the projection server the message comprising in one implementation specification of applications to be provided to the user. The projection server may receive the instruction and select a package of tailored application files to provide to the client terminal . In one implementation the projection server may select and provide to the client terminal a plurality of virtualized application executable files corresponding to selected applications. For example shows an implementation of a user interface for specifying user application privileges in one embodiment of Data Translator operation. The user interface provides a system administrator with facilities to specify a policy rule and or the like delineating which employees groups of employees third parties and or the like should receive which applications and or application packages. In the illustrated implementation a user may specify at a client and or group of clients to which a particular specified application distribution and or access rule and or policy should be applied. The application may be specified at and characteristics of users employees groups departments and or the like who should receive and or be allowed to use that application may be specified at . For example access characteristics may include an employee title an employee function an employee subfunction a department as may be specified by a department code which is discussed in further detail below and with reference to a program as may be specified by a program code which is discussed in further detail below and with reference to an employee name and or the like. The interface therefore provides both for specification of application privileges for wide classes of users as well as for user friendly exception handling whereby a single user or highly specific class of users may be given special access privileges as needed.

In some implementations application files received from the authentication and or data server s at may be virtualized at the projection server such as via application of VMWare s Thinapp to the application files to yield virtualized application executables such as in .EXE format. In another implementation application files may be virtualized at the authentication and or data server s and the virtualized application executables provided to the projection server for temporary storage until they are to be provided to the client terminals.

In one implementation virtualized application executables may be pushed to the thin client using a secure file transfer protocol secure shell SSH and or the like.

The projection server passes the virtualized application executables to the client terminal which receives unpcackages and or runs the files to engage the applications at the client terminal including exchanges of data related to operation of those applications . The projection server may then monitor whether a logout request has been received from the client terminal and if not may wait until such a request is received . The user at the client terminal may then initiate a logout when he or she is finished with the application session precipitating a re initialization of the client terminal whereby data updates are passed over the network to one or more targets and the client terminal is returned to its pre login and or pre boot state . In one embodiment the terminal may erase e.g. securely the contents of its memory to ensure a pre boot state and enhance security for example by issuing root admin level format command on the storage mechanism e.g. hard drive. In one implementation user generated data and or other saved data may be persisted and or passed to the authentication and or data server s by the projection server and projection of application images to the client terminal ceased . In an alternative implementation the client terminal may itself communicate directly with the authentication and or data server s to provide data update information. Data updates received by the authentication and or data server s may be stored and or persisted such as in a central database .

In one implementation one or more fields of user information e.g. name and department code may be mandatory with remaining fields optional. An example of a instruction message response to user information for application access may comprise a list of application identifiers and may in one implementation take a form similar to the following XML example 

In one implementation the instruction message may further include a client terminal device identifier to direct the application files to the appropriate target.

The Data Translator system may contain a number of operational components and or data stores. A Data Translator controller may serve a central role in some embodiments of Data Translator operation serving to orchestrate the reception generation modification and distribution of data and or instructions to from and between Data Translator components and or mediate communications with external entities and systems.

In one embodiment the Data Translator controller may be housed separately from other controllers modules components and or databases within or external to the Data Translator system while in another embodiment some or all of the other modules components controllers and or databases within and or external to the Data Translator system may be housed within and or configured as part of the Data Translator controller. Further detail regarding implementations of Data Translator controller operations modules components and databases is provided below.

In the implementation illustrated in the Data Translator system may be integrated as part of an authentication control and or data server and the Data Translator controller may be configured to couple to external entities and or systems via one or more interface components. For example. the Data Translator controller may be coupled to a projection server client interface . In one implementation the projection server client interface may mediate communications to and from a remote projection server and or one or more client terminals such as to receive data requests data inputs table tracking syntax configured strings rule specifications organizational structure specification and or inputs instructions and or the like and to return data rules instructions parsed string tokens generated table tracking syntax configured strings and or the like. The Data Translator controller may further be coupled to a central database interface . In one implementation the central database interface may mediate communications to and from a remote central database to send parsed string tokens data updates rules data requests and or the like and to receive requested data rules table identifiers field identifiers column identifiers and or the like. The Data Translator controller may further be coupled to a user interface . In one implementation the user interface may mediate communications to and from a user to receive administrator inputs settings configuration inputs and or files table tracking syntax configured strings data requests data inputs updates and or the like and to send graphical user interface screens requested data generated strings and or the like. In various implementations one or more of the interface components described above may serve to configure data into application transport network media access control and or physical layer formats in accordance with a network transmission protocol such as but not limited to FTP TCP IP SMTP Short Message Peer to Peer SMPP and or the like. For example the interfaces may be configured for receipt and or transmission of data to an external and or network database. The interfaces may further be configurable to implement and or translate Wireless Application Protocol VOIP and or the like data formats and or protocols. The interfaces may further house one or more ports jacks antennas and or the like to facilitate wired and or wireless communications with and or within the Data Translator system.

In one implementation the Data Translator controller may further be coupled to a plurality of components configured to implement Data Translator functionality and or services. For example the Data Translator controller may be coupled to a Parser component which may in one implementation be configured to parse received input strings into constituent string tokens and or otherwise implement interpretation of inputs in accordance with one or more table tracking syntaxes and or descriptive business grammars. The Parser component may further be configured to parse inputs into a table tracking syntax configured input string and attendant data instructions requests and or the like e.g. a search query data input rule request and or the like accompanying a table specifying input string . The Data Translator controller may further be coupled to a Command Generator component which may in one implementation be configured to generate database manipulation commands queries data input and or storage commands and or the like such as based on tokens extracted from received input strings. For example in one implementation the Command Generator component may be configured to receive parsed string tokens such as from the Parser component and generate a SQL Select command to query data from a Data Translator database and or generate a SQL Insert Into command to enter attendant data into a Data Translator database. Implementations such as these are illustrated in further detail below. The Data Translator controller may further be coupled to a Dynamic Syntax Generator component which may in one implementation be configured to dynamically generate a syntax and or strings configured with a dynamic syntax in response to user action. For example in one implementation the Dynamic Syntax Generator may engage a graphical user interface such as may be provided to a client terminal via the Projection Server Client Interface and or the User Interface that is accessible by a user and that admits inputs indicative of an organizational structure said inputs instructing the formation and or organization of the dynamic syntax. The Data Translator controller may further be coupled to a String Generator component which may in one implementation be configured to generate strings in association with various inputs and or stored data. For example in one implementation the String Generator may be configured to generate strings based on organizational hierarchies generated by and or with the Dynamic Syntax Generator . In another implementation the String Generator may be configured to generate strings matching data queries such as may be submitted by a user to see any and or all syntax configured strings that match the data query.

In one implementation the Data Translator controller may further be coupled to one or more databases configured to store and or maintain Data Translator data. A Syntax database may contain information pertaining to string token types and or sequences delimiters string token lengths syntax identifiers dynamic syntax parameters and or the like. In some implementations the Data Translator may compare received input strings with fields and or records in the Syntax database in order to verify formatting of the input string assist in parsing the string and or the like.

In some implementations links may exist between lower level and or atomic level tables as well. For example in the illustrated implementation the Client table is linked to the Country table and to the Vertical table and the LegalEntity table is linked to the Country table . Some tables linked by foreign keys to tables shown in have been omitted from illustration for the sake of clarity.

In some implementations links may exist between lower level and or atomic level tables as well. For example in the illustrated implementation the Class table is linked to the SubClass table . Some tables linked by foreign keys to tables shown in have been omitted from illustration for the sake of clarity.

An Employee table may include fields allowing specification of records pertaining to user and or employee attributes and or characteristics and or the like. In one implementation an Employee table may include fields such as but not limited to UserID GUID UserName Email SubTitleID SubFunctionID ISOwner StartDate EndDate CreatedBy CreatedDate UpdatedBy UpdatedDate TS TitleID FK FunctionID FK DepartmentCodeID and or the like. Some tables linked by foreign keys to tables shown in have been omitted from illustration for the sake of clarity.

A string is shown at that is configured in accordance with a table tracking grammar syntax whereby delimited string tokens correlate with and or correspond to tables in the database. For example in the illustrated implementation the string comprises a series of tokes delimited by periods wherein each token admits a table identifier value corresponding to one of the indicated tables. The first token of the string at corresponds to a Client table and may in one implementation admit values for the ClientID field. The second token of the string at corresponds to a Country table and may in one implementation admit values for the CountryID field. The third token of the string at corresponds to a Vertical table and may in one implementation admit values for the VerticalID field. The fourth token of the string at corresponds to a BusinessType table and may in one implementation admit values for the BusinessTypeID field. In some implementations the table tracking string syntax may also include table fields other than table identifier fields. For example while the fifth token of the string at may be said to correspond to or correlate with a ClientProgram table the token itself admits values for the Description field of that table.

In various implementations of a table tracking string syntax various punctuation marks character and or the like e.g. periods commas dashes blank spaces hash marks dollar signs asterisks and or the like and or any combination or sequence thereof may be used in different combinations and arrangements to delimit string tokens. For example in one implementation periods may be placed between pairs of string tokens e.g. the period between the client and country tokens in the string at . In one implementation every pair of string tokens is separated by delimiting punctuation such as a period. In another implementation one or more pairs of tokens may have alternative punctuation and or characters delimiting them than other token pairs and or may have no delimiting punctuation and or characters whatsoever. For example the country token and vertical token in the string at are not delimited by any additional characters or punctuation. In one implementation a string interpreting component may have a pre set token length stored for a given table tracking syntax and may parse the string based for example on the number of characters at a certain point in the string following a particular delimiter and or the like.

In some implementations the table tracking syntax may comprise a descriptive business grammar having string tokens that correspond to table fields determined and or expected to have strong descriptive correlation with business properties and or behaviors. For example the implementation of a program code string syntax shown in has string tokens corresponding to a client name country vertical e.g. industry company position in a supply chain and or the like business type e.g. nature of services provided to a client and a client program description. Any of a wide variety of other tables and or table fields may be correlated with string tokens in other implementations of descriptive business grammars. In one implementation tables and or table fields comprising a string syntax in a descriptive business grammar may be selected by a Data Translator administrator. In an alternative implementation tables and or table fields having strong descriptive correlation with business properties and or behaviors may be determined systematically by selecting one or more business properties and or behaviors of interest e.g. size revenue common business rules and or the like and performing a discriminant analysis classification and or regression tree analysis and or the like statistical analysis to select a subset of tables and or table fields from a larger set the subset having maximal correlation with the business properties and or behaviors of interest.

In one implementation a table tracking string syntax may take a form that is static and pre set such that the number arrangement selection and or the like of string tokens is fixed and or substantially the same for each instance of a string formed in accordance with the syntax. In another implementation a table tracking string syntax may be formed dynamically such as based on user inputs and different strings formed in accordance with the syntax may appear different have a different number selection arrangement and or the like of tokens and or the like. For example hierarchical properties of a system e.g. departments of an organization may be indexed with a dynamic table tracking string syntax having a selection and or number of tokens representing a position of a given property within the hierarchy.

For example the root node depicting the identity of the organization XYZ Corp. has a corresponding department code of XYZ . A sub node emanating from the root note such as the Analytics department shown at may then have a corresponding department code with a root token as in but with the addition of a new token ANA delimited from the root token to yield XYZ.ANA . The addition of further levels of hierarchy may add further tokens to the string syntax. Depending on the hierarchical arrangement of organizational descriptors in the organizational tree different department codes may be generated having tokens in similar positions in the strings which nevertheless correspond to different types of descriptors different tables different table identifiers and or the like. For example in the illustrated implementation the department code at XYZ.MAR.US.LA has a concluding token LA indicating a location of the department i.e. in Los Angeles . On the other hand the department code at XYZ.OPS.CA.A has a concluding token A that is also in the fourth position of the string but here indicates a team affiliation i.e. Team A . In one implementation the Data Translator may parse a dynamic hierarchical table tracking syntax configured string in a hierarchical manner proceeding from a root token which may in some implementations always correspond to a particular table table identifier table field and or the like and then progressively comparing subsequent string tokens to table fields and or linked tables until matches are found permitting identification of the tables table identifiers table fields and or the like to which the string tokens correspond. As such the number of delimiters may indicate the relative hierarchical position of a value but the tokens within the delimiters may represent the types of categorization this has the very powerful advantage allowing for orthogonal constructs of disparate data types within the grammar without excess duplication of descriptors and greater number of descriptive permutations for example it allows for the decoupling of business categories of information from accounting categories while allowing permutations therebetween.

In one embodiment the Data Translator may include a user interface facility similar in appearance to the schematic illustration shown in permitting a graphical generation of a hierarchical organizational chart and corresponding dynamic hierarchical table tracking syntax configured strings such as the department codes shown at see illustrating an example UI screenshot . For example such a user interface may include a plurality of organizational descriptors such as function sub function country location vertical business type client team and or the like that are configured as selectable interface elements. The organizational chart may then be generated by selecting the descriptors for association with different positions in the chart causing new nodes to be created from those positions. In one implementation each descriptor may be dragged and dropped from a bank of descriptors to a position on or near the chart causing that descriptor to become a new node extending by a branch from the nearest node above it in the hierarchy. The Data Translator may also automatically generate a new department code corresponding to the new node by appending a token corresponding to the new node to the string corresponding to the next highest node in the chart from the new node.

If sufficient indicia do not exist to distinguish the type of string and or syntax corresponding to an input string the Data Translator may undertake an error handling process request user specification of the string type perform additional analysis on the input string to discern the type and or the like . If sufficient indicia are present at the Data Translator may determine which string type and or string syntax is associated with the input string such as based on that indicia . In one implementation the Data Translator may distinguish between a string configured in accordance with a static table tracking index and with a dynamic table tracking index. In the illustrated implementation a static table tracking syntax configured input string may then be subjected to a static table tracking syntax parsing and a dynamic table tracking syntax configured input string may be subjected to a dynamic table tracking syntax parsing .

If the Data Translator determines at that the next segment in the string is not an undelimited multi token segment then the Data Translator may extract the whole segment as a string token and store the extracted string token such as in a database in random access memory and or the like.

A determination may be made as to whether there exists a delimiter past the token or tokens previously extracted . If there is an additional delimiter the Data Translator may drop the delimiter from the string and move to evaluate the next string segment . In an implementation where there is no trailing delimiter at the end of a string in a table tracking syntax determining that there are no delimiters at may cause the Data Translator to conclude parsing the input string and or to provide extracted string tokens to a target such as an end user target application database table and or record display device report and or the like.

A determination may then be Data Translator as to whether there exists a delimiter after the first extracted token . If not such as in the case of a single token string configuration then the Data Translator s parsing of the dynamic table tracking syntax string may be concluded and or the extracted string token provided to a target . If a delimiter is found at the Data Translator may drop the delimiter from the input string and move to the next segment of the string . The next string token may be extracted and compared with data fields and or records of a table associated with the previously extracted token to determine a next token type . A determination may be made as to whether a match to the token has been found and if not then an error handling procedure may be undertaken such as providing an error message to the user requesting reentry of the input string checking common typographical or spelling errors and or the like. If on the other hand a match is found to the next token the determined token type may be noted and stored in association with the extracted token before returning to to check for a next delimiter in the string sequence.

In one embodiment department codes may be parsed based on token positions relative to delimiting characters and as such provide the parsed values for use in SQL commands. For example a rule may specify that all department codes having a particular token after the nth delimiting character are authorized to access a particular set of application files. A parsing routine may then count n delimiters and compare the immediately following token to the rule token to determine if the rule is applicable e.g. whether a user associated with the department code is authorized to access the set of application files .

A determination may be made as to whether sufficient query specifiers have been supplied to conduct a database query . If not then an error handling procedure may be undertaken an error message returned additional information may be requested from a user and or the like . If sufficient query specifiers have been supplied the Data Translator may resolve a table name and or a column name based on the query specifiers . For example in one implementation the query specifiers themselves may comprise a table name and or a column name. The Data Translator may also parse the input string into one or more string tokens . The query statement may then be formed as a combination of parsed string tokens and resolved table name and or column name and said statement used to query the database . A determination may be made as to whether one or more results are returned in response to the query . If not then an error handling procedure may be undertaken an error message returned reentry of query parameters requested and or the like . Otherwise if a result is obtained by the query the result may be provided to a target such as to the requesting system to a third party user application system and or the like .

In some implementations the universal data library may be communicatively coupled with an automated data extractor configured to receive specification of report templates and or to generate reports of values associated with universal variables. Report generation schedules triggering conditions and or the like may likewise be specified as part of report template definition and values included in the report may be draw in real time and or on a scheduled periodic or triggered basis via the universal data librarian from multiple otherwise disparate databases and or data sources.

In some implementations the universal data library may further be communicatively coupled with a global data exchanger configured to communicate with one or more internal or external databases and or data sources to exchange data therewith. For example the Data Translator may be coupled to one or more external data servers and or external databases to receive data files therefrom and or provide data files thereto. In one implementation the Data Translator may be configured to retrieve one or more data files from an external data source such as on a scheduled periodic triggered and or the like basis parse discrete data units from the file contents wherein the parsing may depend on whether the file is fixed length delimited XML format and or the like and associate the parsed data units with universal variables in accordance with a pre defined specification. In some implementations the Data Translator may further be configured to mediate exchanges of data between internal databases. For example the Data Translator may be configured to draw data from a source database such as on a scheduled periodic triggered and or the like basis and to associate the drawn data with universal variables in accordance with a pre defined specification. In both cases association of sourced data with universal variables may cause the sourced data to be input in one or more internal databases based on associations between database tables and or fields and universal variables as defined within the universal data librarian.

In one implementation the universal data librarian global data exchanger and or Data Translator may be configured to reformat data such as to place it in a condition of conformity with like data in a target database. For example sourced date data may be in a MM DD YY format while target date data is stored in a DD MM YYYY format. One or more of the described systems may be configured to reformat data as needed or desired in accordance with a pre defined specification. In one implementation the universal data librarian automated data extractor and or Data Translator may be configured to combine data from one or more sources such as by appending arithmetic operation and or the like into a single data value provided to a data target.

A schematic illustration of Data Translator operation in one example is provided in . Here two application databases and each attended by a respective application server and each have tables and containing fields related to a first name labeled Firstname in table and Name.First in . Each database is communicatively coupled to a universal data library which includes records specifying relationships between the fields in application databases and universal variables. In the illustrated example a record specifies a relationship between the Firstname field in the application database and the universal variable First Name. Similarly a record specifies a relationship between the Name.First field in the application database and the universal variable First Name. The universal variable First Name and or values thereof may then be provided to a user interface third party application external data target report generator and or the like . Though omitted for clarity details pertaining to the location of fields in an application database such as table names foreign keys and or the like may also be included in universal data library records to facilitate location of desired data.

The interface may further allow for specification of a function reformatting and or the like to be applied to data associated with one or more universal variables . For example in the illustrated implementation the CandidateName universal variable field is set as a concatenation of a firstname variable and a lastname variable. The interface may further allow for specification of one or more databases applications and or the like with which a universal variable is to be associated . In one implementation by specifying an application in connection with a particular universal variable a facility may be made available for a user to further specify a particular table and or field within a database associated with that application to which the universal variable should be connected and or mapped. Such further specification is described in further detail below. The interface may further admit specification of particular values for universal variables such as a fixed value for particular variables and or sets of restricted values to which future inputs and or associations must be matched e.g. a list of 50 state abbreviations to which any state input to a corresponding universal variable must conform .

An example implementation of hierarchically arranged universal variables is provided in Appendix A for one embodiment. Each universal variable includes family and subfamily designation and is further characterized by a field name. Variable families may specify high level categories to which particular universal variables belong and or are associated. In the implementation illustrated in Appendix A the families include Consumer Account Payment Letter Call Product Consumer Credit Candidate Employee Plans Forms Supplier Program Employee Government Investor Entity and or the like. Subfamilies may provide further detail as to the nature of the particular universal variable and the field name provides yet further detail to unambiguously designate the type of data to be associated with that universal variables. Universal variables such as may be organized hierarchically with families subfamilies field names and or the like may be selected in some implementations to maximize the extent to which the variables can be mapped to and or otherwise associated with enterprise and or third party data and or database tables and or table fields. For example in one implementation universal variables may comprise business objects wherein the selection naming and organization of the universal variables is designed to facilitate understanding of the variables in a business context and or by those skilled in business who may otherwise have little or no knowledge of database design or management. By mapping table fields from the underlying databases to such business object universal variables embodiments may facilitate manipulation of the data relevant to business managers without the need for assistance from database administrators and or any other database manipulation experts. The selection of universal variables illustrated in Appendix A will hereinafter be referred to as a business descriptive set of universal variables.

In an alternative implementation a universal variable hierarchy may follow a business grammar construct where each segment of the hierarchy follows a business grammar segment or token type e.g. client name followed by country followed by vertical followed by business type followed by client program in an implementation wherein the hierarchy follows a program code grammar .

In another embodiment the hierarchy may itself be stored in the Data Translator database e.g. where an object oriented database may be used to establish entity relationships between a superclass entity and its constituent subclasses and its eventual field entries. In one embodiment each of the XML and or data entries may be read into the user interface table column headings. Thus when a user creates and or edits values in the user interface appropriate records and or XML entries are pushed into the hierarchy data structure.

In one embodiment the universal data librarian and or other components described herein may connect to internal and or external databases by means of one or more database adapters such as but not limited to ODBC JDBC ADO.NET OLEDB and or the like.

If at least one database for the request cannot be identified an error handling procedure may be undertaken such as providing an error message to the user requesting specificity as to the application and or database to which the request is directed and or the like. Otherwise a universal data library query may be generated based on the specified one or more universal variables and the specified and or discerned application and or database.

In one implementation business grammar tokens may be connected to and or otherwise associated with particular universal variables which in turn may be linked to table fields in local and or remote databases. A query or other database transaction leveraging a business grammar string may then be employed to access and or transact data with table fields in either local or remote databases using universal variables as intermediaries in construction of for example SQL commands. This query may be submitted to the universal data librarian to determine one or more table fields in the specified database and or a database associated with the specified application to which the specified universal variable corresponds. A determination may be made as to whether the associated field exists in the target database whether the field has some data values stored in association with it and or the like and if not another error handling procedure may be undertaken such as providing an error message to the user. In one implementation determination of whether an associated field exists may be accomplished by evaluating a database management system response to a query submission e.g. whether the desired data is retrieved or whether an error message is returned from the database management system . Otherwise a database command may be generated for the target database based on the identified one or more fields and the original user request . The database command may in various implementations and or uses comprise a query an input a data transfer a data reformatting an update and or the like. The generated command may then be submitted to the target database to effect the desired transaction .

Once the external values are associated with universal variables the values may be stored in an appropriate database provided to a local application and or the like .

In some implementations the reverse procedure may also be implemented by the Data Translator whereby data values stored in a local database and associated with universal variables are provided as values for external variables and configured as an output file for provision to an external data server and or external database . In some implementations the output file may be configured as a report which may be provided for viewing on a display device for printing and or the like. In some implementations the formatting instructions may be reversible and applied to either external variable values or reversibly to universal variable values.

The data exchange illustrated in is similar to that shown in A except that instead of reformatting a single external variable and or universal variable value the Data Translator may apply a function to combine values associated with more than one of the variables to yield the appropriate associations. For example the function may specify that Universal Variable 1 is equal to External Variable 1 while Universal Variable 2 is equal to a sum of External Variable 1 and External Variable 2. This example function is reversible since External Variable 1 and External Variable 2 could be recovered from Universal Variable 1 and Universal Variable 2 i.e. External Variable 1 Universal Variable 1 and External Variable 2 Universal Variable 2 Universal Variable 1 . Any mathematical operation calculation computation data manipulation reformatting and or the like may be applied to data by the Data Translator as desired in various implementations or embodiments of Data Translator operation.

In some implementations the Data Translator in may be provided at the local side with a limited subset of universal variable inputs a file containing universal variable inputs and or pointers to universal variables and or the like. This may allow for isolation of data received from an external source and or generation of universal variable collections for particular functions or implementations of Data Translator embodiments. For example in one implementation a universal payment file may be generated locally containing a set of universal variables that are expected to be relevant to any bank payment transaction. The Data Translator may then have particular mappings set up for particular banks whereby each mapping selects a subset of universal variables from the universal payment file that is relevant to and or desired by the particular bank Fto which payment information is being provided. For example a domestic wire transaction in the U.S. may only use a routing number and account number while an international wire may instead or in addition require a Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Transaction SWIFT code intermediary bank information and account number and or the like.

In another example a user may specify a periodic schedule e.g. a specified time of each day at which the Data Translator is to pull a file from or push a file to an external data target. In another example a user may specify a triggering condition e.g. a data update a user request or other user action occurrence of an automated part of a process and or the like the occurrence of which triggers a Data Translator mediated data exchange between the universal variables and the target. The scheduled and or triggered data exchange may also apply to data exchanges between local databases mapped to universal variables. For example a user may specify that at a specified time every day particular fields in local database 1 corresponding to the universal variables should be updated with data in fields in local database 2 associated with those same universal variables. In some implementations a user may specify a time variable and or trigger variable frequency of effectuating transactions. For example if a new external source has just been added and the data from that source is expected to be updated frequently in an initial period the transaction schedule for that source may be set to a twice daily frequency for the first week followed by a once daily update for the following two weeks and a weekly update thereafter. Transaction frequencies may also be automatically varied based on the detected occurrence of specified triggers. For example the Data Translator may monitor a stock market index such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and may be configured to increase transaction frequencies related to market data when a slope of the monitored index exceeds a specified threshold and to decrease the transaction frequency when the slope of the monitored index drops back below the specified threshold.

The interface may further provide a listing of selectable universal variables for association such as via a drag and drop interface mechanism with parsed components of an external data file such as may be received from an external source or may be destined for transmission to an external target . An example of such a listing of selectable universal variables is shown at in . In one implementation a universal variable may be dragged and dropped to an association area of the interface wherein the universal variable may be mapped to and or otherwise associated with a specified portion of the external file. For example in one implementation the external file may be configured as a fixed length file and one or more universal variables may be associated with one or more portions of the fixed length file as specified by the position of the data within that file. In another implementation the external file may be configured as a delimited file and one or more universal variables may be associated with one or more portions of the delimited file as specified by how the data is delimited within the file. In another implementation the external file may be configured as an XML file and one or more universal variables may be associated with one or more portions of the XML file as specified by the XML tags setting off data within the file.

An implementation of an XML data exchange specification resulting from inputs to interfaces such as those shown in examples of may take a form similar to the following example 

Other file configurations and parsing specifiers may be employed within various implementations of Data Translator embodiments.

In one implementation the Data Translator may perform an initial check of the file to ensure that it does not have any clear problems or errors. For example the Data Translator may check that the file has at least a minimum file size e.g. not a null file is configured in accordance with an expected format does not exhibit any characteristics of a virus or other undesired file and or the like. If errors or other problems are detected an error handling procedure may be undertaken such as providing an error message to a specified recipient e.g. an administrator of the data source attempting to repair the file attempting to extract any salvageable data from the file and or the like. A determination may be made as to whether there is any retrievable data in the file such as following an attempted repair at and if not then the process may conclude . Otherwise if data can be retrieved from the file the Data Translator may query a parse instruction from a mapping record associated with the transaction . The parsing instruction may for example specify a position of data in the file for a fixed length file a number of delimiters setting off data in the file for a delimited file an XML tag setting off the data in an XML file and or the like. Based on the parsing instruction the Data Translator may parse data from the file . A determination may then be made as to whether any reformatting of the data is needed or desired such as may be specified in the mapping record. For example the convention for formatting of dates may be different in the file than for the universal variable to which the date is to be connected so a conversion of format may be desired before associating the file data with the universal variable and or table fields connected thereto in local databases. If conversion is desired then a conversion instruction may be queried from the mapping record and the particular data converted and or reformatted in accordance with that instruction . The Data Translator may then query a data location associated with the mapping to which the data from the file is to be provided such as may be directed by a universal variable specified in the mapping record. For example the data location may be a field in a table in a database mapped to the universal variable to which the data from the file is connected. The data parsed from the file may then be stored at the data location and a determination made as to whether there is any further data in the file to be extracted . If so information associated with the next data element may be queried from the mapping record associated with the transaction and the Data Translator may return to to parse that next data from the file. Otherwise the transaction may be concluded .

If there are not multiple columns or if there are multiple columns but no fixed relationship therebetween the Data Translator may generate input statements such as SQL Input statements with the input data which may in some implementations be arranged in multiple independent columns and the corresponding table field locations to save the data from the file at those locations . In some implementations a SQL statement generated as described above may take a form similar to the following example 

 PhoneTypeCode PhoneNumber PhoneSource PhoneSubSource AccountID Effective Date CreatedDate TS CreatedBy 

tblPhoneNumber PhoneTypeCode tblPhoneNumber PhoneNumber tblPhoneNumber PhoneSource tblPhoneNumber PhoneSubSource AccountID getdate getdate 633976851390538675 311 

when len ltrim rtrim t1.tblPhoneNumber PhoneNumber60 0 and isnumeric ltrim rtrim t1.tblPhoneNumber PhoneNumber60 1

when len ltrim rtrim t1.tblPhoneNumber PhoneNumber60 0 and isnumeric ltrim rtrim t1.tblPhoneNumber PhoneNumber60 0

else ltrim rtrim t1.tblPhoneNumber PhoneNumber60 end as tblPhoneNumber PhoneNumber t1.tblPhoneNumber PhoneSource90 as tblPhoneNumber PhoneSource t1.tblPhoneNumber PhoneSubSource100 as tblPhoneNumber PhoneSubSource t3.AccountID

on t3.ClientAccountNumber t1.tblAccountHdr ClientAccountNumber10 and t3.ProgramID t2.ProgramID WHERE t1.tblPhoneNumber PhoneTypeCode50 is not null AND t1.tblPhoneNumber PhoneNumber60 is not null AND t1.tblPhoneNumber PhoneSource90 is not null AND t1.tblPhoneNumber PhoneSubSource100 is not null b

If on the other hand the Data Translator determines that there are multiple columns with a fixed relationship between them at then it may seek to discern relationships between table field locations to which the columns in the file correspond . For example the file may include a column for customer name which is connected to a universal variable CustomerName and a column for customer account which is connected to a universal variable CustomerAccount. Each universal variable is in turn mapped to table fields within one or more databases such as a customer name field and a customer account field. In order to build a command to port the file data to those fields the Data Translator may seek to determine the relationship between the customer name field and the customer account field. If these fields are in the same table in the same database a direct Input statement may be employed. However if for example the fields exist in different tables within a database the Input statement may be supplemented with a Join clause such as a SQL Join clause to reflect the connection between the tables and the data provided thereto. By inputting the data with the Join clause the connection between the customer name information and the customer account information will be preserved for future access. Further detail as to how the relationship between table fields is determined is provided below. Once the relationship is established the Data Translator may generate an Input statement with the file data the table field locations and any necessary or desired Join clauses and may store the data with the generated statement .

Another implementation of a report parameter specification interface is shown at in with report parameter fields filled. displays an example of a report generated by the inputs shown in . The report is configured as a spreadsheet file and includes columns corresponding to extracted data such as call account number call user name call phone number call result extended result which may in one implementation include additional information to refine the call result information call date and or time and or the like.

In one implementation Silverlight code general Silverlight language libraries and or the like may be used to generate the tables and column presentation in HTML format. The tables may be comprised of text fields and appropriate calls to the libraries may be made to pass information via drag and drop.

In various implementations a report may be generated for output as a physical document e.g. a printout an electronic document a structured data file e.g. fixed length delimited XML and or the like one or more database records a user interface display and or the like.

A determination may be made as to whether any of the retrieved data is to be reformatted modified functionally combined with one or more other data values and or the like prior to inclusion in the report . If so the reformatting instructions may be retrieved such as by querying them from a report generation template record and those instructions may then be applied to one or more selected universal variables and or universal variable values . In one implementation a set of data layout and or configuration instructions may also be retrieved such as from a report specification template record. Data layout and or configuration instructions may for example. include specifications of the arrangement and or order of data font text size text color and or other typographical characteristics of the data titles headers borders margins table formats charts graphics and or the like for inclusion with the data and or the like. The retrieved data may then be configured in accordance with the retrieved layout and or configuration instructions .

A report target may then be queried such as from a report generation template record. A report target may in various implementations be selected from any of a wide variety of different possibilities such as a display interface a printer a local or remote database and or data server an electronic file and or document format e.g. portable document format spreadsheet word processing document and or the like and or the like. The configured report may then be provided to the target . In some implementations a schedule triggering condition and or the like may monitored to determine when the report should be provided to the target. In one implementation the schedule triggering condition and or the like for provision of a report to a target may be separate and distinct from a schedule triggering condition and or the like for report generation and or data querying for inclusion in a report.

In some implementations the Data Translator may be integrated as part of the system architecture illustrated in and may interact with any or all of the other system components described with reference thereto. For example in one implementation the Data Translator may be provided at the authentication control server and or at the data server to mediate interactions with data stored in one or more central databases . For example in one implementation the data projection server may correspond to the Data Translator server and the central database s may corresponds to the Datab Translator database . respectively as illustrated in . Mediated interactions may include interactions with external and or third party data sources or targets projection servers thin clients and or other network terminal devices and or the like.

In some implementations the authentication and or data server s may generate and or update a golden image application files data tables and or records and or the like and may pass the golden image and or other updates to the projection server which receives them at . A client terminal may be booted such as on machine startup to initiate a network e.g. PXE boot passing a boot request over the network such as to the projection server . The projection server in turn may monitor and or determine whether a boot request has been received . If not the projection server may wait for a period of time before checking again for a boot request . Once the request is received the projection server may pass files and or data to the client terminal . The client may start the boot process and begin to copy and unpack the materials provided from the projection server. Using the received files from the projection server that have now been executed instantiated a user at the client terminal may login and or otherwise generate a user ID . The generated user ID may then be passed to the authentication and or data server s which may access user information and or a user profile associated with the user ID . Accessed user information may then be used to determine which applications to include in a tailored application package for that user . In some implementations the user appropriate applications may include one or more softphone applications facilitating the placement and reception of telephone calls via the user s client terminal.

Once the appropriate package of applications is determined for the user the authentication and or data server s may pass an instruction message to the projection server the message comprising in one implementation specification of applications to be provided to the user. The projection server may receive the instruction and select a package of tailored application files to provide to the client terminal . In one implementation the projection server may select and provide to the client terminal a plurality of virtualized application executable files corresponding to selected applications including the softphone applications. The client terminal may in some implementations perform any installation procedures necessary prior to execution of the softphone applications.

In some implementations a user e.g. logged in at a client terminal e.g. may be authorized to place receive telephone calls and may wish to place a call to a user e.g. logged into a second client terminal e.g. or a user e.g. operating a standard telephone e.g. operatively connected to an external network e.g. a circuit switching public switched telephone network PSTN such as . In such implementations the client terminal may be provided along with the virtualized softphone application files an IP address of at least one SIP Registrar server in the network to which requests for telephony services may be placed. For example the SIP Registrar servers may be a projection server and or the data servers. The SIP Registrar servers may be operatively connected to a Call Restrictor database and a SIP Locator database . In some implementations after the softphone applications are installed on the client terminals the client terminals may send requests to be registered for telephony services. For example the client terminals may send a SIP REGISTER request with authentication credentials over the network to the server operating as one of the SIP Registrar servers within the context of providing telephony services. A non limiting exemplary message format illustrating substantive aspects of providing a register request written substantially in a form adapted to SIP is provided below 

Authorization Digest username bob realm secure.softphone.com nonce 89fcece786ab5632efd89210e7672f2a opaque uri sips ss2.softphone.com response cbe5a259aa9c8elae688df84f1cec424 

In some implementations the SIP Registrar may check the authentication credentials of the user and acknowledge registration after authenticating the user. A non limiting exemplary message format illustrating substantive aspects of the SIP Registrar acknowledging authentication of the user written substantially in a form adapted to SIP is provided below 

In some implementations once the users at the client terminals are authorized to receive softphone application files for installation the projection and or authentication data servers providing the installation files may automatically send the REGISTER request to the SIP Registrar on behalf of the client terminals. The REGISTER request messages may comprise additional information including but not limited to an indication of where the requests originated from e.g. IP address of the client terminal or projection server etc. an IP address of the client terminal for which registration is requested any Uniform Resource Locators URLs to associate with the client terminal e.g. for click to talk applications an e mail address to associate with the client terminal types of services requested e.g. ability to only place calls only receive calls both place and receive calls voicemail capability direct to voicemail call forwarding etc. and an expiration time for the telephony service. For example such information may be transmitted as an XML data in a body of a message. A non limiting exemplary message illustrating substantive aspects of transmitting data between a client and or server within the SIP messaging framework written substantially in a form adapted to SIP XML is provided below 

Numerous other methods specified in the SIP protocol may utilize a message structure similar to the examples described above for transferring instructions acknowledgments data and or the like between one or more computing systems operatively connected via the communications network. In some implementations a projection server sending the REGISTER request on behalf of the client terminal may query the SIP Location database e.g. for client terminal IP address URLs to associate with the client terminal and the Call Restrictor database e.g. for types of service allowed expiration time to determine appropriate values for the attributes of the REGISTER request. The SIP Registrar may receive the REGISTER request and determine if it needs to perform a user permissions check. If for example based on the REGISTER request contents e.g. whether the originating IP address is a projection server or a client terminal the SIP Registrar determines that user permissions need to be checked for a given request the SIP Registrar may query the Call Restrictor database to verify that the user is permitted to place receive telephone calls. A non limiting exemplary program listing illustrating substantive aspects of querying a Call Restrictor database written substantially in the form of SQL commands is provided below 

function UserPermissions DBserver password userid mysql connect 201.408.185.132 DBserver password access database server mysql select db CallRestrictor.rdb select database to search

 query SELECT place calls receive calls voicemail call forwarding forwarding address FROM RestrictionsTable WHERE userid LIKE userid create query for permissions of a user in the UserPermissions table with userid as the search term

If the user is not permitted to use any telephony services option Y the SIP Registrar may deny the request and may respond with a 405 Not Allowed message to the originating IP address and or client terminal. If the user is permitted to have at least one type of telephony service Option N the SIP Registrar may accept the REGISTER request and e.g. provide a 200 OK message for the client terminal at . The SIP Registrar may save update the SIP Location database with the registration details e.g. hardware type client terminal projection server authentication server IP address SIP address URLs services permitted time of request time of registration expiration etc. for the client terminal. A non limiting exemplary program listing illustrating substantive aspects of updating the a database with details for the client terminal written substantially in the form of SQL commands is provided below 

function UpdateUserDetails DBserver password userid mysql connect 201.408.185.132 DBserver password access database server mysql select db SIPLocation.rdb select database to update UPDATE ClientsTable

SET ip 192.168.34.67 email bob client.softphone.com url http client.softphone.com users bob service expiry 36000 place calls TRUE receive calls FALSE voicemail TRUE DIRECT forwarding TRUE forwarding address 547 823 1272 

WHERE userid userid update the required values for the specified user mysql close SIPLocation.rdb close connection to database

The SIP Registrar may also send a 200 OK message to the originating IP address and or client terminal to indicate that registration of the client terminal has been successfully performed and may also list the terms of registration e.g. SIP address URLs services permitted time of request time of registration expiration etc. in one or more header fields and or message body in the 200 OK message.

In some implementations if the user wishes to unregister from the telephony services the user may send a SIP UNREGISTER request to the SIP Registrar. The SIP Registrar may use the user details parsed from the SIP UNREGISTER request and query the SIP Locations database using the user details. If a user entry corresponding to the user details is not found in the SIP Locations database the SIR Registrar may send a SIP 404 NOT FOUND message to the user as in . If a user entry corresponding to the user details is found in the SIP Locations database the SIR Registrar may delete the entry from the SIP Locations database and generate and send an acknowledgment SIP 200 OK message to the user as in . In some implementations if a user e.g. client wishes to initiate a communication e.g. place a telephone call to user or user from the client terminal the user may operate the softphone application via the hardware resources at the client terminal to send a SIP INVITE message request via a nearest projection server e.g. acting as a SIP Proxy server within the context of telephony services. The INVITE request may include the user ID and or display name the SIP and or IP address of the client terminal a name of the user being invited to a telephone call e.g. user or user the user s ID a URL associated with the user a standard telephone number of the user being invited to a telephone call and or a format for transfer of audio data packets once the invitation has been accepted and a telephone session has been established e.g. RTP protocol . A non limited exemplary INVITE message illustrating exemplary aspects of providing an invitation to initiate communications written substantially in a form adapted to SIP is provided below 

The SIP Proxy server e.g. may on receiving the INVITE request forward the request on to other SIP Proxy servers e.g. servers within network which may in turn continue the forwarding process until the INVITE request is received at the SIP Registrar. The SIP Registrar upon receiving the INVITE request may parse the INVITE request to determine the particulars of the request being made. For example the SIP Registrar may utilize XML parser methods built in to the PHP scripting language and or most modern web browsers. The SIP Registrar may also query the Call Restrictor database to determine whether any restrictions are applicable to the INVITE request made by the user at client terminal . The restrictions may relate to the permitted services for either user and or user . Upon receiving the results of the query to the Call Restrictor database the SIP Registrar may compare the attributes of the INVITE request to the results of the query to the Call Restrictor database. For example in some implementations the SIP Registrar may execute a server side hypertext preprocessor PHP script interfacing with a database using SQL commands to compare the attributes of the INVITE request to the results of the query to the Call Restrictor database. A non limiting exemplary program listing illustrating substantive aspects of implementing such functionality written substantially in the form of PHP SQL commands is provided below 

 Determine if INVITE is permissible e.g. whether call may be placed by querying the Call Restrictor database

mysql connect 201.408.185.132 DBserver password access database server mysql select db CallRestrictor.rdb select database to search

 query SELECT place calls FROM RestrictionsTable WHERE user1 id LIKE user1 AND user2 id LIKE user2 create query for whether user1 can call user2

 query SELECT receive calls FROM RestrictionsTable WHERE user1 id LIKE user2 AND user2 id LIKE user1 create query for whether user2 can receive a call from user2

If the SIP Registrar determines that either of user and or user is not authorized for the services requested in the INVITE request the SIP Registrar may return to the client terminal a 405 Method Not Allowed message and in some implementations along with a list of allowed actions for user and or user included in an tag in the message body. The SIP Registrar may also save the details of the received INVITE request to a Call Log database. The 405 Method Not Allowed message may be routed back to user s client terminal via the SIP proxy servers in the network. If however the SIP Registrar determines that the INVITE request is within the bounds of permitted services for the client terminal the SIP Registrar may continue processing by querying the SIP Locator database to determine the SIP address to route the INVITE request to. Upon receiving the INVITE request the SIP Registrar may query the SIP Locator database for an IP or SIP address of the user based on the information provided in the INVITE request. The SIP Registrar may barring call restrictions forward the INVITE request to the appropriate destination e.g. IP and or SIP address according to the results of the query to the SIP Locator database. If the destination lies within the TCP IP network e.g. such as when calling user the INVITE request may be routed via the projection servers authentication data servers routers and or other hardware elements acting as SIP Proxy servers operatively connected to the TCP IP network until the INVITE request is received at a user client terminal e.g. . The user client terminal may in response to the received INVITE request send back to client terminal a SIP 180 Ringing message and initiate an action to attract the other user s attention via the hardware resources available at the other user s client terminal e.g. on screen incoming call display via a monitor installed at the other user s client terminal and or ringing tone via music speakers and or headphones installed at the other user s client terminal . However if the destination lies outside the TCP IP network e.g. such as user using a standard telephone operatively connected to an external public switched telephone network PSTN the INVITE request may be routed to a computer and or other device in the network acting as a Gateway server e.g. Cisco high speed serial interface HSSI . In such an example the Gateway server may present a packet switched interface towards the TCP IP network and a circuit switched interface to the PSTN network . The INVITE request may be converted into the appropriate dial tones according to the operating protocols of the external network and an appropriate ring tone may be initiated at the standard telephone of the other user. For example if invited user accepts the INVITE request the terminal client may send back a SIP 180 RINGING message via the packet switched network to user indicate to acceptance of the invitation request. If for example invited user picks up the standard telephone a circuit path may be established via PSTN network between the telephone and the circuit switched interface of the gateway server . The Gateway server then may generate a SIP 180 RINGING message on behalf of the telephone and transmit this message via the Gateway server s packet switched interface and the packet switched network back to client terminal . Accordingly a telephone media transfer session may be established between the two parties of the telephone call across multiple networks of various types regardless of the locations of the two parties. Upon receiving the SIP 180 RINGING message the servers in the system may forward the message until it is received at the client originating the INVITE request establishing the communications media transfer session. Once the media transfer session has been established between the participants in the session e.g. telephone call between user and user the participants may generate media e.g. audio only video only audio video dynamic content and or the like packets using the hardware resources operatively connected to the respective thin client terminals and the installed softphone applications. The media packets may be exchanged between the participants. In some implementations the media packets may be transferred from one client terminal to the other in an asynchronous fashion e.g. using UDP RTP communication protocols . For example each media packet may traverse a different route from source to destination client terminal within the packet switched network and the media packets may be received at the receiver of the media packets in an order which may not match the order in which the media packets were generated and or transmitted. Further the media packets may traverse a route different from the SIP signaling messages controlling the telephone session. The media packets may be formatted in accordance with a protocol agreed upon based on the protocol specified in the initial INVITE request. For example the exemplary INVITE message provided above illustrating exemplary aspects of providing an invitation to initiate communications specifies that audio packets may be transmitted in accordance with the RTP protocol. In some implementations the media packets may be formatted in accordance with the Real time Transport Protocol RTP . Each RTP media packet may include one or more header fields and a payload. The media packet header fields may include information including a payload type e.g. audio only video only audio video dynamic payload etc. a sequence number providing guidance to a receiver of the media packets as to an order in which the media packets may be arranged e.g. in order to recreate the original transmitted signal e.g. and or identify missing media packets at the receiver a timestamp indicating a time at which the media packet was generated which may in conjunction with the timestamps of other media packets and the sequence indicate to the receiver of the media packets a sampling rate of the media stream and jitter and or delay in transmission a source identifier identifying an IP and or SIP address of the source of the media packet and a destination identifier identifying an IP and or SIP address of the intended final destination of the media packet. In some implementations a participant e.g. user in a telephony session with user may wish to terminate the session. The user s client terminal may send a SIP BYE request to the client terminal and or the Gateway server . If the client terminal encounters the BYE message the client terminal considers the session with client terminal terminated and may generate and send a SIP 200 OK 481 Call Transaction Does Not Exist a 408 Request Timeout message or provide no response. If the client terminal initiates a BYE message directed at the telephone the BYE message may be sent to the Gateway server . The Gateway server may convert the message into an appropriate set of tones for the circuit switched network and may transmit the tones via the PSTN network to the telephone indicating that user has terminated the communication session. Upon receiving acknowledgment from the other client that the session has terminated the clients may delete any data structures stored in memory related to the session and relieve any other hardware and or software resources previously being utilized in the communication session for use in other applications.

In an exemplary embodiment user may be transmitting media packets for delivery to user . The media packets may be routed via multiple paths e.g. within the packet switched network . In some implementations each node e.g. a projection server data server router system client terminal etc. in a route traversed by a media packet may process the media packet for routing and or call restriction and or other purposes. For example a media packet may be routed via projection server . Projection server may receive the media packet and extract information from the header of the media packet. In some implementations the projection server may extract information regarding destination identifier identifying an IP and or SIP address of the intended final destination of the media packet. Based on the destination identifier information the projection server may determine the most appropriate next node to transmit the media packet to e.g. based on a Domain Name System service and initiate transfer of the media packet.

In some implementations each node in a route may perform similar operations to determine the best next node to transmit the media packet to. In some implementations each node in a transmission route including the client terminals may extract from a media packet generated by transmitted to it header information including but not limited to a source identifier identifying an IP and or SIP address of the source of the media packet and a destination identifier identifying an IP and or SIP address of the intended final destination of the media packet. For example a node may utilize the freeware open source FFmpeg cross platform solution to parse RTP packets and extract for example file header information and media data included in the RTP packets being transmitted as part of a telecommunications session. Upon obtaining the source and destination addresses for the media packet the node may query the Call Restrictor database using the information extracted from the packet. The node may analyze the results of the query to the Call Restrictor database to determine if any call restriction rules are present which may restrict transmission of the media packet from the source identified by the source identifier to the destination identified by the destination identifier.

If the node determines that one or more rules may require prevention of transmission of packets from the source to the destination e.g. option Y the node may discard the media packet from memory generate and send a SIP 403 Forbidden message to the previous node in the route and or the originating IP SIP address of the media packet to indicate that the transmission may not take place according to one or more rules present in the Call Restrictor database.

If the node determines that no restrictions are in effect preventing transmission of packets from the source to the destination e.g. option N the node may add information to the header of the media packet to indicate the route taken by the packet decrement the maximum number of allowable hops required to reach the intended destination include a timestamp for retransmission include the results of the analysis the node performed on the packet in taking the decision to transmit the packet forward towards its destination and or the like. The node may use the source and destination addresses Domain Name System addressing and transmission models such as unicasting broadcasting and or multicasting to determine the next node s to transmit the updated media packet to . Upon determining the nodes to transmit the media packet to the node may generate the necessary transmissions .

In some implementations each node of a packet switched network may perform such processing to quickly extinguish any media packets in circulation occupying transmission bandwidth within the network which may not be authorized for transmission to their respective final destinations. In some implementations the Call Restrictor database may be updated such that one or more ongoing transmissions and or sessions may become unauthorized while still in progress on the basis of the update to the rules in the Call Restrictor database. In such implementations each node processing media packets for compliance with call restriction rules may receive results to querying the Call Restrictor database that reflect the latest updates to the rules present in the Call Restrictor database in real time. Accordingly in some implementations updates to call restriction rules present in the Call Restrictor database may be implemented dynamically within the entire packet switched network in real time and may be advantageously applied not only to new communications invitations but also to existing on going conversations and or other media data exchanges.

In some implementations call restriction processing may advantageously be concentrated at specific nodes where collection and reordering of all media packets related to a telephone session are implemented. For example in some implementations media packets transmitted by client terminal intended for delivery to client terminal may first be aggregated at a projection server nearest the destination terminal client e.g. projection server and or the source destination client terminals themselves. The processing node may aggregate the media packets related to such transmission and process the media packets to reorder them according to the sequence numbers provided in the header fields of each of the media packets prior to transmission to the client terminal . For example in some implementations a node may utilize the freeware open source FFmpeg cross platform multimedia handling solution to reorder packets according to a decoding time stamp DTS and or a presentation time stamp PTS associated with each of the packets. For example the node may aggregate a number of media packets being transmitted in one direction as part of a telecommunications session. The node may assign a temporary identifier for each packet. The node may then extract the DTS and PTS associated with each of the packets e.g. using the FFmpeg application. The node may associate each extracted DTS and or PTS with the temporary identifier for the packets. The node may arrange the temporary identifiers of the packets e.g. according to an increasing order of PTS in order to arrange the media packets according to the order of presentation required by the generator of the media packets. The processing node may extract information from the media packets as a batch identifying for example an IP and or SIP address of the source of the media packet and the destination identifier identifying an IP and or SIP address of the intended final destination of the media packet.

The processing node may query the Call Restrictor database using the information extracted from the aggregated media packets. The node may analyze the results of the query to the Call Restrictor database to determine if any call restriction rules are present which may restrict transmission of the media packets from the source identified by the source identifier to the destination identified by the destination identifier. If the projection server determines that one or more rules may require prevention of transmission of packets from the source to the destination the node may discard the entire set of aggregated media packets and send a SIP 403 Forbidden message lieu of all the aggregated packets to the previous node in the route and or the originating IP SIP address of the media packets to indicate that the transmission may not take place according to one or more rules present in the Call Restrictor database.

Accordingly in some implementations call restrictions rules present in the Call Restriction database may be implemented throughout the entire packet switched network with a minimal number of high performance server systems and a minimal number of servers requiring access to the Call Restrictor database. Also in some implementations utilizing concentrated processing of call restriction rules updates to call restriction rules present in the Call Restrictor database may be implemented within the entire packet switched network within a time period approaching an average packet transmission time between the most distant terminal clients within the packet switched network and may be advantageously applied not only to new telephone conversation invitations but also to existing on going conversations and or other media data exchanges.

The attributes of the Call Restrictor database and a user interface system for entry of call restriction rules into the Call Restrictor database in one embodiment of Data Translator operation are described hereinafter in greater detail with reference to . In some implementations the Call Restrictor database stored a number of rules according to which restriction of calls is implemented. The rules may embed within themselves legal regulatory corporate etc. rule compliance and provide technological solutions to management compliance problems. The rules may regulate various softphone functionalities including telemarketing collections reminders robocalling etc. The rules in the Call Restrictor database may be structured to affect a limited subset of softphone terminals applications and or users or may be structured to affect a broad spectrum of entities via a single effective syntax and operating structure. For example with reference to the rule prescribed in may apply to any client operating within the United States of America who has a Business Type beginning with the letter F . In another example using a rule structure that is substantially similar to the previous example the rule prescribed in may narrowly only affect a specific subset of entities within a client e.g. DTV wherein those entities operate in only one country e.g. US wherein the entities have a FE Business Type and a FC vertical business integration parameter and a description XX. Accordingly the descriptive business grammar of the present invention may provide a flexible and powerful rules defining and implementation platform for call restriction.

With further reference to an exemplary rule may include a number of fields. In some implementations the fields may be varied mutually exclusive to each other in alternate implementations these selections of values for one field may affect the values that may be chosen for other fields in the rule. In some implementations the fields may provide a method to specify a rule level e.g. a priority level a classification type etc. of the rule a plurality of conditions that are required to be satisfied in order for the rule to be in effect and a plurality of results that may be the outcome of implementation of the specified rule. For example the exemplary rule may be interpreted in some implementations as For the regulatory rule if any account holder residing in the state of MA has been called greater than two times in a period spanning the last 7 days on his her home phone regardless of the call result and or when the last letter was sent to him her and or the result of sending any letter calls may not be made to that account. A non limiting exemplary data structure illustrating substantive aspects of specifying rules as described above written substantially in the form of XML is provided below 

In some implementations a server side PHP script may be implemented on a Data Translator server to read in an XML data file including such a rule parse the XML data file to determine the rule fields and associated values and generate SQL commands to insert the rule from the XML data file into a rules database such as for example a Call Restrictor database. The rule may be designated in the exemplary implementation as a regulatory rule. In some implementations a plurality of business rules of varying scope and effect may pertain to a specific account. The rules in such implementations may be prioritized according to for example the rule level. In some exemplary implementations the regulatory rules may take precedence over rules created to reflect client instructions which in turn may take precedence over rules created in order to reflect best internal business practices. In alternate implementations the rule level may determine which rules are implemented and or the order in which such rules are implemented.

Rules may be implemented that depend on other numerous factors than the originator of the rule and properties of the account affected by the rule. For example rules may be implemented that are time sensitive. For example specifies five exemplary illustrative rules that are applicable to all clients countries vertical non vertical businesses types and descriptions e.g. per based on the time at which the rules are evaluated for enforcement. For example rule may be interpreted in some implementations as A regulatory rule that states that accounts in the state of PA may not be messaged prior to 1 30 pm on Sundays. As another example rule may be interpreted in some implementations as A regulatory rule that states that accounts in the state of TX may not be messaged prior to 9 00 am on Saturdays. As another example rule may be interpreted in some implementations as A client instruction to restrict messaging of accounts in the state of TX prior to 12 00 pm on all Sundays. As another example rule may be interpreted in some implementations as A regulatory rule that states that accounts in any message may not be called at any time on Sundays. As another example rule may be interpreted in some implementations as A regulatory rule that states that accounts in the state of OK may not be messaged prior to 9 00 am on any day. 

Rules may be advantageously developed that depend further on frequency intensity of prior activities. For example may illustrate exemplary rules as being applicable to all accounts e.g. per . As one example rule may be interpreted in one implementation as A regulatory rule that states that no action need be taken for accounts in the state of NH where a work phone has been called more than once within the last 30 days regardless of the call result date the last letter was sent or the result of sending the letter. As another example rule may be interpreted in one implementation as A regulatory rule that states that no calls may be placed to accounts in the area of NYC where any phone has been called more than 2 times within the last 7 days regardless of the call result s date the last letter was sent or the result of sending the letter. As another example rule may be interpreted in one implementation as A regulatory rule that states that no calls may be placed to accounts in the area of OR where a work phone has been called more than 1 time within the last 7 days regardless of the call result s date the last letter was sent or the result of sending the letter. Further rule for example may be interpreted in some implementations as A regulatory rule that prohibits calling accounts in WA state if the work phone has been called more than once over the past seven days. As another example rule may be interpreted in one implementation as A regulatory rule that states that no calls may be placed to accounts in the area of ME where any phone has been called more than 1 time within the last 1 day regardless of the call result s date the last letter was sent or the result of sending the letter. As another example rule may be interpreted in one implementation as A regulatory rule that states that no calls may be placed to accounts in the area of WA where any phone has been called more than 3 times within the last 7 days regardless of the call result s date the last letter was sent or the result of sending the letter. As another example rule may be interpreted in one implementation as An internal rule that states that no calls may be placed to accounts in any area where a cell phone has been called any number of times within any prior period regardless of the call result s date the last letter was sent or the result of sending the letter. As another example rule may be interpreted in one implementation as An internal rule that states that no calls may be placed to accounts in any area where any phone has been called more than or equal to 3 times within the last 7 days regardless of the call result s date the last letter was sent or the result of sending the letter. As another example rule may be interpreted in one implementation as A regulatory rule that states that no work may be performed for accounts in the area of AZ where a home phone has been called less than or equal to 3 times during any prior period regardless of the call result s date the last letter was sent or the result of sending the letter. As another example rule may be interpreted in one implementation as A regulatory rule that states that no work may be performed for accounts in the area of AZ where a home phone has been called greater than 3 times during any prior period resulting in an RPC call result s regardless of the date the last letter was sent or the result of sending the letter. As another example rule may be interpreted in one implementation as A regulatory rule that states that no work may be performed for accounts in the area of AZ where a home phone has been called greater than 3 times during any prior period resulting in an Message call result s regardless of the date the last letter was sent or the result of sending the letter. As another example rule may be interpreted in one implementation as A regulatory rule that states that no work may be performed for accounts in the area of AZ where a home phone has been called greater than 3 times during any prior period resulting in an Third Party call result s regardless of the date the last letter was sent or the result of sending the letter. As another example rule may be interpreted in one implementation as A regulatory rule that states that no work may be performed for accounts in the area of NH where a home phone has been called any number of times during any prior period resulting in an RPC call result s regardless of the date the last letter was sent or the result of sending the letter. As another example rule may be interpreted in one implementation as A regulatory rule that states that no work may be performed for accounts in the area of NH where a home phone has been called any number of times during any prior period resulting in a Message call result s regardless of the date the last letter was sent or the result of sending the letter. 

Further rules may be advantageously developed that result in the performance of additional activities. For example may illustrate exemplary rules as being applicable to all accounts e.g. per and resulting in electronic postal letters being sent. As one example rule may be interpreted in one implementation as A regulatory rule that states that a notice letter be sent for accounts in any area where no letters have been sent. Another example rule may be interpreted in one implementation as A regulatory rule that states that a notice letter be sent for accounts in any area where address information has been changed. Another example rule may be interpreted in one implementation as A client rule that states that a notice letter be sent for accounts in any area where the placement age equals 1. Another example rule may be interpreted in one implementation as A regulatory rule that states that a ACH letter be sent for accounts in any area where payment by check by phone is required in less than or equal to 5 days and the inactivity period is less than or equal to 5 days. Another example rule may be interpreted in one implementation as A regulatory rule that states that a Credit Card letter be sent for accounts in any area where payment by visa is required in 6 days and the inactivity period is 6 days. 

Numerous other variations of rules depending from a variety of legal regulatory client driven internal best practices business time and or other factors modifying the permissions for transmission of media packets between the various entities involved in the Data Translator are contemplated.

In some implementations media packets may be exchanged bi directionally between two client terminals via nodes in the communications network simultaneously in real time. In such implementations the direction of transmission of media packets may be determined by extracting from the media packet header fields information regarding the source identified by the source identifier and the destination identified by the destination identifier. Accordingly in some implementations media packets traveling in each direction may be analyzed independently of the media packets traveling in the opposite direction. In some implementations media packets traveling in one direction may be aggregated at a concentrating node server and or client terminal and reordered according to the sequence numbers provided in the header fields of each of the media packets. Call analytics may be performed on the media contents of the aggregated and reordered media packets. Accordingly in some implementations call analytics on media transmitted from one client terminal to another may be advantageously performed independent of any transmission in the opposite direction and or any other transmission between any other nodes and or terminals occurring simultaneously within a packet switched network.

Typically users which may be people and or other systems may engage information technology systems e.g. computers to facilitate information processing. In turn computers employ processors to process information such processors may be referred to as central processing units CPU . One form of processor is referred to as a microprocessor. CPUs use communicative circuits to pass binary encoded signals acting as instructions to enable various operations. These instructions may be operational and or data instructions containing and or referencing other instructions and data in various processor accessible and operable areas of memory e.g. registers cache memory random access memory etc. . Such communicative instructions may be stored and or transmitted in batches e.g. batches of instructions as programs and or data components to facilitate desired operations. These stored instruction codes e.g. programs may engage the CPU circuit components and other motherboard and or system components to perform desired operations. One type of program is a computer operating system which may be executed by CPU on a computer the operating system enables and facilitates users to access and operate computer information technology and resources. Some resources that may be employed in information technology systems include input and output mechanisms through which data may pass into and out of a computer memory storage into which data may be saved and processors by which information may be processed. These information technology systems may be used to collect data for later retrieval analysis and manipulation which may be facilitated through a database program. These information technology systems provide interfaces that allow users to access and operate various system components.

In one embodiment the Data Translator controller may be connected to and or communicate with entities such as but not limited to one or more users from user input devices peripheral devices an optional cryptographic processor device and or a communications network .

Networks are commonly thought to comprise the interconnection and interoperation of clients servers and intermediary nodes in a graph topology. It should be noted that the term server as used throughout this application refers generally to a computer other device program or combination thereof that processes and responds to the requests of remote users across a communications network. Servers serve their information to requesting clients. The term client as used herein refers generally to a computer program other device user and or combination thereof that is capable of processing and making requests and obtaining and processing any responses from servers across a communications network. A computer other device program or combination thereof that facilitates processes information and requests and or furthers the passage of information from a source user to a destination user is commonly referred to as a node. Networks are generally thought to facilitate the transfer of information from source points to destinations. A node specifically tasked with furthering the passage of information from a source to a destination is commonly called a router. There are many forms of networks such as Local Area Networks LANs Pico networks Wide Area Networks WANs Wireless Networks WLANs etc. For example the Internet is generally accepted as being an interconnection of a multitude of networks whereby remote clients and servers may access and interoperate with one another.

The Data Translator controller may be based on computer systems that may comprise but are not limited to components such as a computer systemization connected to memory .

A computer systemization may comprise a clock central processing unit CPU s and or processor s these terms are used interchangeable throughout the disclosure unless noted to the contrary a memory e.g. a read only memory ROM a random access memory RAM etc. and or an interface bus and most frequently although not necessarily are all interconnected and or communicating through a system bus on one or more mother board s having conductive and or otherwise transportive circuit pathways through which instructions e.g. binary encoded signals may travel to effect communications operations storage etc. Optionally the computer systemization may be connected to an internal power source . Optionally a cryptographic processor may be connected to the system bus. The system clock typically has a crystal oscillator and generates a base signal through the computer systemization s circuit pathways. The clock is typically coupled to the system bus and various clock multipliers that will increase or decrease the base operating frequency for other components interconnected in the computer systemization. The clock and various components in a computer systemization drive signals embodying information throughout the system. Such transmission and reception of instructions embodying information throughout a computer systemization may be commonly referred to as communications. These communicative instructions may further be transmitted received and the cause of return and or reply communications beyond the instant computer systemization to communications networks input devices other computer systemizations peripheral devices and or the like. Of course any of the above components may be connected directly to one another connected to the CPU and or organized in numerous variations employed as exemplified by various computer systems.

The CPU comprises at least one high speed data processor adequate to execute program components for executing user and or system generated requests. Often the processors themselves will incorporate various specialized processing units such as but not limited to integrated system bus controllers memory management control units floating point units and even specialized processing sub units like graphics processing units digital signal processing units and or the like. Additionally processors may include internal fast access addressable memory and be capable of mapping and addressing memory beyond the processor itself internal memory may include but is not limited to fast registers various levels of cache memory e.g. level 1 2 3 etc. RAM etc. The processor may access this memory through the use of a memory address space that is accessible via instruction address which the processor can construct and decode allowing it to access a circuit path to a specific memory address space having a memory state. The CPU may be a microprocessor such as AMD s Athlon Duron and or Opteron ARM s application embedded and secure processors IBM and or Motorola s DragonBall and PowerPC IBM s and Sony s Cell processor Intel s Celeron Core 2 Duo Itanium Pentium Xeon and or XScale and or the like processor s . The CPU interacts with memory through instruction passing through conductive and or transportive conduits e.g. printed electronic and or optic circuits to execute stored instructions i.e. program code according to conventional data processing techniques. Such instruction passing facilitates communication within the Data Translator controller and beyond through various interfaces. Should processing requirements dictate a greater amount speed and or capacity distributed processors e.g. Distributed Data Translator mainframe multi core parallel and or super computer architectures may similarly be employed. Alternatively should deployment requirements dictate greater portability smaller Personal Digital Assistants PDAs may be employed.

Depending on the particular implementation features of the Data Translator may be achieved by implementing a microcontroller such as CAST s R8051XC2 microcontroller Intel s MCS 51 i.e. 8051 microcontroller and or the like. Also to implement certain features of the Data Translator some feature implementations may rely on embedded components such as Application Specific Integrated Circuit ASIC Digital Signal Processing DSP Field Programmable Gate Array FPGA and or the like embedded technology. For example any of the Data Translator component collection distributed or otherwise and or features may be implemented via the microprocessor and or via embedded components e.g. via ASIC coprocessor DSP FPGA and or the like. Alternately some implementations of the Data Translator may be implemented with embedded components that are configured and used to achieve a variety of features or signal processing.

Depending on the particular implementation the embedded components may include software solutions hardware solutions and or some combination of both hardware software solutions. For example Data Translator features discussed herein may be achieved through implementing FPGAs which are a semiconductor devices containing programmable logic components called logic blocks and programmable interconnects such as the high performance FPGA Virtex series and or the low cost Spartan series manufactured by Xilinx. Logic blocks and interconnects can be programmed by the customer or designer after the FPGA is manufactured to implement any of the Data Translator features. A hierarchy of programmable interconnects allow logic blocks to be interconnected as needed by the Data Translator system designer administrator somewhat like a one chip programmable breadboard. An FPGA s logic blocks can be programmed to perform the function of basic logic gates such as AND and XOR or more complex combinational functions such as decoders or simple mathematical functions. In most FPGAs the logic blocks also include memory elements which may be simple flip flops or more complete blocks of memory. In some circumstances the Data Translator may be developed on regular FPGAs and then migrated into a fixed version that more resembles ASIC implementations. Alternate or coordinating implementations may migrate Data Translator controller features to a final ASIC instead of or in addition to FPGAs. Depending on the implementation all of the aforementioned embedded components and microprocessors may be considered the CPU and or processor for the Data Translator.

The power source may be of any standard form for powering small electronic circuit board devices such as the following power cells alkaline lithium hydride lithium ion lithium polymer nickel cadmium solar cells and or the like. Other types of AC or DC power sources may be used as well. In the case of solar cells in one embodiment the case provides an aperture through which the solar cell may capture photonic energy. The power cell is connected to at least one of the interconnected subsequent components of the Data Translator thereby providing an electric current to all subsequent components. In one example the power source is connected to the system bus component . In an alternative embodiment an outside power source is provided through a connection across the I O interface. For example a USB and or IEEE 1394 connection carries both data and power across the connection and is therefore a suitable source of power.

Interface bus ses may accept connect and or communicate to a number of interface adapters conventionally although not necessarily in the form of adapter cards such as but not limited to input output interfaces I O storage interfaces network interfaces and or the like. Optionally cryptographic processor interfaces similarly may be connected to the interface bus. The interface bus provides for the communications of interface adapters with one another as well as with other components of the computer systemization. Interface adapters are adapted for a compatible interface bus. Interface adapters conventionally connect to the interface bus via a slot architecture. Conventional slot architectures may be employed such as but not limited to Accelerated Graphics Port AGP Card Bus Extended Industry Standard Architecture E ISA Micro Channel Architecture MCA NuBus Peripheral Component Interconnect Extended PCI X PCI Express Personal Computer Memory Card International Association PCMCIA and or the like.

Storage interfaces may accept communicate and or connect to a number of storage devices such as but not limited to storage devices removable disc devices and or the like. Storage interfaces may employ connection protocols such as but not limited to Ultra Serial Advanced Technology Attachment Packet Interface Ultra Serial ATA PI Enhanced Integrated Drive Electronics E IDE Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE fiber channel Small Computer Systems Interface SCSI Universal Serial Bus USB and or the like.

Network interfaces may accept communicate and or connect to a communications network . Through a communications network the Data Translator controller is accessible through remote clients e.g. computers with web browsers by users . Network interfaces may employ connection protocols such as but not limited to direct connect Ethernet thick thin twisted pair 10 100 1000 Base T and or the like Token Ring wireless connection such as IEEE 802.11a x and or the like.

Generally any mechanization and or embodiment allowing a processor to affect the storage and or retrieval of information is regarded as memory . However memory is a fungible technology and resource thus any number of memory embodiments may be employed in lieu of or in concert with one another. It is to be understood that the Data Translator controller and or a computer systemization may employ various forms of memory . For example a computer systemization may be configured wherein the functionality of on chip CPU memory e.g. registers RAM ROM and any other storage devices are provided by a paper punch tape or paper punch card mechanism of course such an embodiment would result in an extremely slow rate of operation. In a typical configuration memory will include ROM RAM and a storage device . A storage device may be any conventional computer system storage. Storage devices may include a drum a fixed and or removable magnetic disk drive a magneto optical drive an optical drive i.e. Blueray CD ROM RAM Recordable R ReWritable RW DVD R RW HD DVD R RW etc. an array of devices e.g. Redundant Array of Independent Disks RAID solid state memory devices USB memory solid state drives SSD etc. other processor readable storage mediums and or other devices of the like. Thus a computer systemization generally requires and makes use of memory.

The memory may contain a collection of program and or database components and or data such as but not limited to operating system component s operating system information server component s information server user interface component s user interface Web browser component s Web browser database s mail server component s mail client component s cryptographic server component s cryptographic server the Data Translator component s and or the like i.e. collectively a component collection . These components may be stored and accessed from the storage devices and or from storage devices accessible through an interface bus. Although non conventional program components such as those in the component collection typically are stored in a local storage device they may also be loaded and or stored in memory such as peripheral devices RAM remote storage facilities through a communications network ROM various forms of memory and or the like.

The operating system component is an executable program component facilitating the operation of the Data Translator controller. Typically the operating system facilitates access of I O network interfaces peripheral devices storage devices and or the like. The operating system may be a highly fault tolerant scalable and secure system such as Apple Macintosh OS X Server AT T Plan 9 Be OS Unix and Unix like system distributions such as AT T s UNIX Berkley Software Distribution BSD variations such as FreeBSD NetBSD OpenBSD and or the like Linux distributions such as Red Hat Ubuntu and or the like and or the like operating systems. However more limited and or less secure operating systems also may be employed such as Apple Macintosh OS IBM OS 2 Microsoft DOS Microsoft Windows 2000 2003 3.1 95 98 CE Millenium NT Vista XP Server Palm OS and or the like. An operating system may communicate to and or with other components in a component collection including itself and or the like. Most frequently the operating system communicates with other program components user interfaces and or the like. For example the operating system may contain communicate generate obtain and or provide program component system user and or data communications requests and or responses. The operating system once executed by the CPU may enable the interaction with communications networks data I O peripheral devices program components memory user input devices and or the like. The operating system may provide communications protocols that allow the Data Translator controller to communicate with other entities through a communications network . Various communication protocols may be used by the Data Translator controller as a subcarrier transport mechanism for interaction such as but not limited to multicast TCP IP UDP unicast and or the like.

An information server component is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. The information server may be a conventional Internet information server such as but not limited to Apache Software Foundation s Apache Microsoft s Internet Information Server and or the like. The information server may allow for the execution of program components through facilities such as Active Server Page ASP ActiveX ANSI Objective C C and or .NET Common Gateway Interface CGI scripts dynamic D hypertext markup language HTML FLASH Java JavaScript Practical Extraction Report Language PERL Hypertext Pre Processor PHP pipes Python wireless application protocol WAP WebObjects and or the like. The information server may support secure communications protocols such as but not limited to File Transfer Protocol FTP HyperText Transfer Protocol HTTP Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTPS Secure Socket Layer SSL messaging protocols e.g. America Online AOL Instant Messenger AIM Application Exchange APEX ICQ Internet Relay Chat IRC Microsoft Network MSN Messenger Service Presence and Instant Messaging Protocol PRIM Internet Engineering Task Force s IETF s Session Initiation Protocol SIP SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions SIMPLE open XML based Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol XMPP i.e. Jabber or Open Mobile Alliance s OMA s Instant Messaging and Presence Service IMPS Yahoo Instant Messenger Service and or the like. The information server provides results in the form of Web pages to Web browsers and allows for the manipulated generation of the Web pages through interaction with other program components. After a Domain Name System DNS resolution portion of an HTTP request is resolved to a particular information server the information server resolves requests for information at specified locations on the Data Translator controller based on the remainder of the HTTP request. For example a request such as http 123.124.125.126 myInformation.html might have the IP portion of the request 123.124.125.126 resolved by a DNS server to an information server at that IP address that information server might in turn further parse the http request for the myInformation.html portion of the request and resolve it to a location in memory containing the information myInformation.html. Additionally other information serving protocols may be employed across various ports e.g. FTP communications across port and or the like. An information server may communicate to and or with other components in a component collection including itself and or facilities of the like. Most frequently the information server communicates with the Data Translator database operating systems other program components user interfaces Web browsers and or the like.

Access to the Data Translator database may be achieved through a number of database bridge mechanisms such as through scripting languages as enumerated below e.g. CGI and through inter application communication channels as enumerated below e.g. CORBA WebObjects etc. . Any data requests through a Web browser are parsed through the bridge mechanism into appropriate grammars as required by the Data Translator. In one embodiment the information server would provide a Web form accessible by a Web browser. Entries made into supplied fields in the Web form are tagged as having been entered into the particular fields and parsed as such. The entered terms are then passed along with the field tags which act to instruct the parser to generate queries directed to appropriate tables and or fields. In one embodiment the parser may generate queries in standard SQL by instantiating a search string with the proper join select commands based on the tagged text entries wherein the resulting command is provided over the bridge mechanism to the Data Translator as a query. Upon generating query results from the query the results are passed over the bridge mechanism and may be parsed for formatting and generation of a new results Web page by the bridge mechanism. Such a new results Web page is then provided to the information server which may supply it to the requesting Web browser.

Also an information server may contain communicate generate obtain and or provide program component system user and or data communications requests and or responses.

The function of computer interfaces in some respects is similar to automobile operation interfaces. Automobile operation interface elements such as steering wheels gearshifts and speedometers facilitate the access operation and display of automobile resources functionality and status.

Generally the mail client provides a facility to compose and transmit electronic mail messages.

A cryptographic server component is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU cryptographic processor cryptographic processor interface cryptographic processor device and or the like. Cryptographic processor interfaces will allow for expedition of encryption and or decryption requests by the cryptographic component however the cryptographic component alternatively may run on a conventional CPU. The cryptographic component allows for the encryption and or decryption of provided data. The cryptographic component allows for both symmetric and asymmetric e.g. Pretty Good Protection PGP encryption and or decryption. The cryptographic component may employ cryptographic techniques such as but not limited to digital certificates e.g. X.509 authentication framework digital signatures dual signatures enveloping password access protection public key management and or the like. The cryptographic component will facilitate numerous encryption and or decryption security protocols such as but not limited to checksum Data Encryption Standard DES Elliptical Curve Encryption ECC International Data Encryption Algorithm IDEA Message Digest 5 MD5 which is a one way hash function passwords Rivest Cipher RC5 Rijndael RSA which is an Internet encryption and authentication system that uses an algorithm developed in 1977 by Ron Rivest Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman Secure Hash Algorithm SHA Secure Socket Layer SSL Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTPS and or the like. Employing such encryption security protocols the Data Translator may encrypt all incoming and or outgoing communications and may serve as node within a virtual private network VPN with a wider communications network. The cryptographic component facilitates the process of security authorization whereby access to a resource is inhibited by a security protocol wherein the cryptographic component effects authorized access to the secured resource. In addition the cryptographic component may provide unique identifiers of content e.g. employing and MD5 hash to obtain a unique signature for an digital audio file. A cryptographic component may communicate to and or with other components in a component collection including itself and or facilities of the like.

The Data Translator database component may be embodied in a database and its stored data. The database is a stored program component which is executed by the CPU the stored program component portion configuring the CPU to process the stored data. The database may be a conventional fault tolerant relational scalable secure database such as Oracle or Sybase. Relational databases are an extension of a flat file. Relational databases consist of a series of related tables. The tables are interconnected via a key field. Use of the key field allows the combination of the tables by indexing against the key field i.e. the key fields act as dimensional pivot points for combining information from various tables. Relationships generally identify links maintained between tables by matching primary keys. Primary keys represent fields that uniquely identify the rows of a table in a relational database. More precisely they uniquely identify rows of a table on the one side of a one to many relationship.

Alternatively the Data Translator database may be implemented using various standard data structures such as an array hash linked list struct structured text file e.g. XML table and or the like. Such data structures may be stored in memory and or in structured files. In another alternative an object oriented database may be used such as Frontier ObjectStore Poet Zope and or the like. Object databases can include a number of object collections that are grouped and or linked together by common attributes they may be related to other object collections by some common attributes. Object oriented databases perform similarly to relational databases with the exception that objects are not just pieces of data but may have other types of functionality encapsulated within a given object. If the Data Translator database is implemented as a data structure the use of the Data Translator database may be integrated into another component such as the Data Translator component . Also the database may be implemented as a mix of data structures objects and relational structures. Databases may be consolidated and or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing techniques. Portions of databases e.g. tables may be exported and or imported and thus decentralized and or integrated.

In one embodiment the Data Translator database may interact with other database systems. For example employing a distributed database system queries and data access by search Data Translator component may treat the combination of the Data Translator database an integrated data security layer database as a single database entity.

In one embodiment user programs may contain various user interface primitives which may serve to update the Data Translator. Also various accounts may require custom database tables depending upon the environments and the types of clients the Data Translator may need to serve. It should be noted that any unique fields may be designated as a key field throughout. In an alternative embodiment these tables have been decentralized into their own databases and their respective database controllers i.e. individual database controllers for each of the above tables . Employing standard data processing techniques one may further distribute the databases over several computer systemizations and or storage devices. Similarly configurations of the decentralized database controllers may be varied by consolidating and or distributing the various database components . The Data Translator may be configured to keep track of various settings inputs and parameters via database controllers.

The Data Translator database may communicate to and or with other components in a component collection including itself and or facilities of the like. Most frequently the Data Translator database communicates with the Data Translator component other program components and or the like. The database may contain retain and provide information regarding other nodes and data.

The Data Translator component is a stored program component that is executed by a CPU. In one embodiment the Data Translator component incorporates any and or all combinations of the aspects of the Data Translator that was discussed in the previous figures. As such the Data Translator affects accessing obtaining and the provision of information services transactions and or the like across various communications networks.

The Data Translator component enables the management of enterprise and human resources the provision of tailored and or personalized computing experiences massively scalable monitoring and regulation of personnel efficient collection organization distribution and presentation of enterprise data and or the like and use of the Data Translator.

The Data Translator component enabling access of information between nodes may be developed by employing standard development tools and languages such as but not limited to Apache components Assembly ActiveX binary executables ANSI Objective C C and or .NET database adapters CGI scripts Java JavaScript mapping tools procedural and object oriented development tools PERL PHP Python shell scripts SQL commands web application server extensions web development environments and libraries e.g. Microsoft s ActiveX Adobe AIR FLEX FLASH AJAX D HTML Dojo Java JavaScript jQuery UI MooTools Prototype script.aculo.us Simple Object Access Protocol SOAP SWFObject Yahoo User Interface and or the like WebObjects and or the like. In one embodiment the Data Translator server employs a cryptographic server to encrypt and decrypt communications. The Data Translator component may communicate to and or with other components in a component collection including itself and or facilities of the like. Most frequently the Data Translator component communicates with the Data Translator database operating systems other program components and or the like. The Data Translator may contain communicate generate obtain and or provide program component system user and or data communications requests and or responses.

The structure and or operation of any of the Data Translator node controller components may be combined consolidated and or distributed in any number of ways to facilitate development and or deployment. Similarly the component collection may be combined in any number of ways to facilitate deployment and or development. To accomplish this one may integrate the components into a common code base or in a facility that can dynamically load the components on demand in an integrated fashion.

The component collection may be consolidated and or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing and or development techniques. Multiple instances of any one of the program components in the program component collection may be instantiated on a single node and or across numerous nodes to improve performance through load balancing and or data processing techniques. Furthermore single instances may also be distributed across multiple controllers and or storage devices e.g. databases. All program component instances and controllers working in concert may do so through standard data processing communication techniques.

The configuration of the Data Translator controller will depend on the context of system deployment. Factors such as but not limited to the budget capacity location and or use of the underlying hardware resources may affect deployment requirements and configuration. Regardless of if the configuration results in more consolidated and or integrated program components results in a more distributed series of program components and or results in some combination between a consolidated and distributed configuration data may be communicated obtained and or provided. Instances of components consolidated into a common code base from the program component collection may communicate obtain and or provide data. This may be accomplished through intra application data processing communication techniques such as but not limited to data referencing e.g. pointers internal messaging object instance variable communication shared memory space variable passing and or the like.

If component collection components are discrete separate and or external to one another then communicating obtaining and or providing data with and or to other component components may be accomplished through inter application data processing communication techniques such as but not limited to Application Program Interfaces API information passage distributed Component Object Model D COM Distributed Object Linking and Embedding D OLE and or the like Common Object Request Broker Architecture CORBA local and remote application program interfaces Jini Remote Method Invocation RMI SOAP process pipes shared files and or the like. Messages sent between discrete component components for inter application communication or within memory spaces of a singular component for intra application communication may be facilitated through the creation and parsing of a grammar. A grammar may be developed by using standard development tools such as lex yacc XML and or the like which allow for grammar generation and parsing functionality which in turn may form the basis of communication messages within and between components. For example a grammar may be arranged to recognize the tokens of an HTTP post command e.g. 

where Value1 is discerned as being a parameter because http is part of the grammar syntax and what follows is considered part of the post value. Similarly with such a grammar a variable Value1 may be inserted into an http post command and then sent. The grammar syntax itself may be presented as structured data that is interpreted and or other wise used to generate the parsing mechanism e.g. a syntax description text file as processed by lex yacc etc. . Also once the parsing mechanism is generated and or instantiated it itself may process and or parse structured data such as but not limited to character e.g. tab delineated text HTML structured text streams XML and or the like structured data. In another embodiment inter application data processing protocols themselves may have integrated and or readily available parsers e.g. the SOAP parser that may be employed to parse communications data. Further the parsing grammar may be used beyond message parsing but may also be used to parse databases data collections data stores structured data and or the like. Again the desired configuration will depend upon the context environment and requirements of system deployment.
