One increasingly popular form of networking may generally be referred to as remote presentation systems which can use protocols such as Remote Desktop Protocol RDP and Independent Computing Architecture ICA to share a desktop and other applications executing on a server with a remote client. Such computing systems typically transmit the keyboard presses and mouse clicks or selections from the client to the server relaying the screen updates back in the other direction over a network connection e.g. the Internet . As such the user has the experience as if his or her machine is operating entirely locally when in reality the client device is only sent screenshots of the desktop or applications as they appear on the server side.

In a remote presentation or remote desktop environment a licensing mechanism is typically used. Remote presentation systems typically monitor and control access to the various applications that are remotely accessed often using a licensing model that allows users to use the applications on one or more computers subject to the certain terms and conditions. Server applications may require that clients connecting to the server applications have a license to connect to and use the services of that software. Such licenses may be referred to as a CAL or a client access license. A client access license is a license that gives a user the right to access one or more the services of the server. A server may ensure that a valid client access license is provided by authenticating the license and ensuring that the maximum number of clients for a given application has not been exceeded before allowing access to the application.

Many businesses and enterprises operate in a dynamic business environment and it is desirable that the licensing platform be able to adapt to the changes in the environment. However many remote presentation hosts are configured with a predetermined licensing mode either per device per user or not yet configured. For example the remote client may be configured with a configuration file defining the licensing configuration. The licensing platform license server typically issues different types of client access licenses to the remote client and these licenses are typically per device or per user. Once the licensing mode is set to either per device mode or per user mode the platform will only support the predetermined mode. For example if the platform is set to per device mode all connections to the remote presentation host server will consume only per device client access licenses. The same server typically cannot service both per device and per user modes. This may cause users to use multiple servers to service different types of licensing modes.

Methods and systems are disclosed for providing a mechanism for dynamically switching between the licensing modes on the remote presentation host to handle different kinds of licenses.

In one embodiment the mode switching may be based on the configuration of the users that are connecting to the remote presentation host. In an embodiment users may be provided with remote presentation session files that define what type of license to be used for the current connection to the remote presentation host. Such a switching capability may be particularly useful because third party protocol stacks can very easily switch licensing modes on every remote presentation connection.

In some embodiments mechanisms are disclosed to provide the ability to convert a remote client access license from one type to another by using a convertibility matrix.

In addition to the foregoing other aspects are described in the claims drawings and text forming a part of the present disclosure. It can be appreciated by one of skill in the art that one or more various aspects of the disclosure may include but are not limited to circuitry and or programming for effecting the herein referenced aspects of the present disclosure the circuitry and or programming can be virtually any combination of hardware software and or firmware configured to effect the herein referenced aspects depending upon the design choices of the system designer.

The foregoing is a summary and thus contains by necessity simplifications generalizations and omissions of detail. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the summary is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting.

Further those of ordinary skill in the relevant art will understand that they can practice other embodiments of the invention without one or more of the details described below. Finally while various methods are described with reference to steps and sequences in the following disclosure the description as such is for providing a clear implementation of embodiments of the invention and the steps and sequences of steps should not be taken as required to practice this invention.

It should be understood that the various techniques described herein may be implemented in connection with hardware or software or where appropriate with a combination of both. Thus the methods and apparatus of the invention or certain aspects or portions thereof may take the form of program code i.e. instructions embodied in tangible media such as floppy diskettes CD ROMs hard drives or any other machine readable storage medium wherein when the program code is loaded into and executed by a machine such as a computer the machine becomes an apparatus for practicing the invention. In the case of program code execution on programmable computers the computing device generally includes a processor a storage medium readable by the processor including volatile and non volatile memory and or storage elements at least one input device and at least one output device. One or more programs that may implement or utilize the processes described in connection with the invention e.g. through the use of an application programming interface API reusable controls or the like. Such programs are preferably implemented in a high level procedural or object oriented programming language to communicate with a computer system. However the program s can be implemented in assembly or machine language if desired. In any case the language may be a compiled or interpreted language and combined with hardware implementations.

A remote desktop system is a computer system that maintains applications that can be remotely executed by client computer systems. Input is entered at a client computer system and transferred over a network e.g. using protocols based on the International Telecommunications Union ITU T.120 family of protocols such as Remote Desktop Protocol RDP to an application on a terminal server. The application processes the input as if the input were entered at the terminal server. The application generates output in response to the received input and the output is transferred over the network to the client

The term circuitry used throughout the disclosure can include hardware components such as hardware interrupt controllers hard drives network adaptors graphics processors hardware based video audio codecs and the firmware software used to operate such hardware. The term circuitry can also include microprocessors configured to perform function s by firmware or by switches set in a certain way or one or more logical processors e.g. one or more cores of a multi core general processing unit. The logical processor s in this example can be configured by software instructions embodying logic operable to perform function s that are loaded from memory e.g. RAM ROM firmware and or virtual memory. In example embodiments where circuitry includes a combination of hardware and software an implementer may write source code embodying logic that is subsequently compiled into machine readable code that can be executed by a logical processor. Since one skilled in the art can appreciate that the state of the art has evolved to a point where there is little difference between hardware software or a combination of hardware software the selection of hardware versus software to effectuate functions is merely a design choice. Thus since one of skill in the art can appreciate that a software process can be transformed into an equivalent hardware structure and a hardware structure can itself be transformed into an equivalent software process the selection of a hardware implementation versus a software implementation is trivial and left to an implementer.

A remote desktop system is a computer system that maintains applications that can be remotely executed by client computer systems. Input is entered at a client computer system and transferred over a network e.g. using protocols based on the International Telecommunications Union ITU T.120 family of protocols such as Remote Desktop Protocol RDP to an application on a terminal server. The application processes the input as if the input were entered at the terminal server. The application generates output in response to the received input and the output is transferred over the network to the client computer system. The client computer system presents the output data. Thus input is received and output presented at the client computer system while processing actually occurs at the terminal server. A session can include a shell and a user interface such as a desktop the subsystems that track mouse movement within the desktop the subsystems that translate a mouse click on an icon into commands that effectuate an instance of a program etc. In another example embodiment the session can include an application. In this example while an application is rendered a desktop environment may still be generated and hidden from the user. It should be understood that the foregoing discussion is exemplary and that the presently disclosed subject matter may be implemented in various client server environments and not limited to a particular terminal services product.

In most if not all remote desktop environments input data entered at a client computer system typically includes mouse and keyboard data representing commands to an application and output data generated by an application at the terminal server typically includes video data for display on a video output device. Many remote desktop environments also include functionality that extend to transfer other types of data.

Communications channels can be used to extend the RDP protocol by allowing plug ins to transfer data over an RDP connection. Many such extensions exist. Features such as printer redirection clipboard redirection port redirection etc. use communications channel technology. Thus in addition to input and output data there may be many communications channels that need to transfer data. Accordingly there may be occasional requests to transfer output data and one or more channel requests to transfer other data contending for available network bandwidth.

Turning to illustrated is an exemplary virtual machine server that can be used to generate virtual machines. In this embodiment hypervisor microkernel can be configured to control and arbitrate access to the hardware of computer system . Hypervisor microkernel can isolate processes in one partition from accessing another partition s resources. For example hypervisor microkernel can generate execution environments called partitions such as child partition through child partition N where N is an integer greater than 1 . In this embodiment a child partition is the basic unit of isolation supported by hypervisor microkernel . Each child partition can be mapped to a set of hardware resources e.g. memory devices logical processor cycles etc. that is under control of the hypervisor microkernel . In embodiments hypervisor microkernel can be a stand alone software product a part of an operating system embedded within firmware of the motherboard specialized integrated circuits or a combination thereof.

Hypervisor microkernel can enforce partitioning by restricting a guest operating system s view of the memory in a physical computer system. When hypervisor microkernel instantiates a virtual machine it can allocate pages e.g. fixed length blocks of memory with starting and ending addresses of system physical memory SPM to the virtual machine as guest physical memory GPM . In this embodiment the guest s restricted view of system memory is controlled by hypervisor microkernel . The term guest physical memory is a shorthand way of describing a page of memory from the viewpoint of a virtual machine and the term system physical memory is shorthand way of describing a page of memory from the viewpoint of the physical system. Thus a page of memory allocated to a virtual machine will have a guest physical address the address used by the virtual machine and a system physical address the actual address of the page .

A guest operating system may virtualize guest physical memory. Virtual memory is a management technique that allows an operating system to over commit memory and to give an application sole access to a contiguous working memory. In a virtualized environment a guest operating system can use one or more page tables to translate virtual addresses known as virtual guest addresses into guest physical addresses. In this example a memory address may have a guest virtual address a guest physical address and a system physical address.

In the depicted example parent partition component which can also be also thought of as similar to domain 0 of Xen s open source hypervisor can include a host . Host can be an operating system or a set of configuration utilities and host can be configured to provide resources to guest operating systems executing in the child partitions N by using virtualization service providers VSPs . VPSs which are typically referred to as back end drivers in the open source community can be used to multiplex the interfaces to the hardware resources by way of virtualization service clients VSCs typically referred to as front end drivers in the open source community or paravirtualized devices . As shown by the figures virtualization service clients execute within the context of guest operating systems. However these drivers are different than the rest of the drivers in the guest in that they may be supplied with a hypervisor not with a guest. In an exemplary embodiment the path used to by virtualization service providers to communicate with virtualization service clients and can be thought of as the virtualization path.

As shown by the figure emulators e.g. virtualized IDE devices virtualized video adaptors virtualized NICs etc. can be configured to run within host and are attached to resources available to guest operating systems and . For example when a guest OS touches a memory location mapped to where a register of a device would be or memory mapped to a device microkernel hypervisor can intercept the request and pass the values the guest attempted to write to an associated emulator. The resources in this example can be thought of as where a virtual device is located. The use of emulators in this way can be considered the emulation path. The emulation path is inefficient compared to the virtualized path because it requires more CPU resources to emulate device than it does to pass messages between VSPs and VSCs. For example the hundreds of actions on memory mapped to registers required in order to write a value to disk via the emulation path may be reduced to a single message passed from a VSC to a VSP in the virtualization path.

Each child partition can include one or more virtual processors and that guest operating systems and can manage and schedule threads to execute thereon. Generally the virtual processors are executable instructions and associated state information that provide a representation of a physical processor with a specific architecture. For example one virtual machine may have a virtual processor having characteristics of an Intel x86 processor whereas another virtual processor may have the characteristics of a PowerPC processor. The virtual processors in this example can be mapped to logical processors of the computer system such that the instructions that effectuate the virtual processors will be backed by logical processors. Thus in an embodiment including multiple logical processors virtual processors can be simultaneously executed by logical processors while for example other logical processor execute hypervisor instructions. The combination of virtual processors and memory in a partition can be considered a virtual machine.

Guest operating systems and can be any operating system such as for example operating systems from Microsoft Apple the open source community etc. The guest operating systems can include user kernel modes of operation and can have kernels that can include schedulers memory managers etc. Generally speaking kernel mode can include an execution mode in a logical processor that grants access to at least privileged processor instructions. Each guest operating system can have associated file systems that can have applications stored thereon such as terminal servers e commerce servers email servers etc. and the guest operating systems themselves. The guest operating systems can schedule threads to execute on the virtual processors and instances of such applications can be effectuated.

Referring now to illustrated is a virtual machine server based on an alternative architecture. depicts similar components to those of however in this example embodiment hypervisor can include a microkernel component and components similar to those in host of such as the virtualization service providers and device drivers while management operating system may contain for example configuration utilities used to configure hypervisor . In this architecture hypervisor can perform the same or similar functions as hypervisor microkernel of however in this architecture hypervisor can be configured to provide resources to guest operating systems executing in the child partitions. Hypervisor of can be a stand alone software product a part of an operating system embedded within firmware of the motherboard or a portion of hypervisor can be effectuated by specialized integrated circuits.

Turning now to illustrated is a high level block diagram of virtual desktop server . In an embodiment virtual desktop server can be configured to deploy virtual desktop sessions VDS to clients e.g. mobile devices such as smart phones computer systems having components similar to those illustrated in etc. Briefly virtual desktop technology allows a user to remotely interact with a guest operating system running in a virtual machine. Unlike a remote desktop session in a virtual desktop session only one user is logged into a guest operating system and can have total control of it e.g. the user can run as an administrator and can have full rights on the guest. In the illustrated example virtual desktop server can have components similar to computer system or of or . In the illustrated example virtualization platform is a logical abstraction of virtualization infrastructure components described above in and . The functionality described in the following sections as within virtualization platform can be implemented in one or more of the elements depicted in or . For example virtual desktop manager could be implemented in a host of . More specifically virtual desktop manager could be implemented in a host operating system running in the parent partition.

Starting a virtual desktop session requires instantiation of a guest operating system within a virtual machine. In an exemplary embodiment virtual desktop manager e.g. a module of processor executable instructions can start up virtual machine along with guest operating system in response to a request. Virtual desktop manager can execute on a logical processor and instruct virtualization platform e.g. microkernel hypervisor to allocate memory for a partition. Virtualization platform can execute and set virtual devices up within virtual machine and load a boot loader program into virtual machine memory. The boot loader program can execute on a virtual processor and load guest operating system . For example session manager can be loaded which can instantiate environment subsystems such as runtime subsystem that can include a kernel mode part such as operating system core . For example the environment subsystems in an embodiment can be configured to expose a subset of services to application programs and provide an access point to kernel . When guest operating system is loaded the boot loader program can exit and turn control of the virtual machine over to guest operating system . Guest operating system can execute the various modules illustrated in and configure itself to host a virtual desktop session. For example guest operating system can include registry values that cause remote presentation engine and or configuration service to start upon boot.

A virtual desktop session can start when guest operating system receives a connection request over a network from a client. A connection request can first be handled by remote presentation engine . The remote presentation engine can be configured to listen for connection messages and forward them to session manager . As illustrated by when sessions are generated the remote presentation engine can run a protocol stack instances for the session. Generally the protocol stack instance can be configured to route user interface output to an associated client and route user input received from the associated client to operating system core . Briefly operating system core can be configured to manage screen output collect input from keyboards mice and other devices.

A user credential e.g. a username password combination can be received by remote presentation engine and passed to session manager . Session manager can pass the credential to a logon procedure which can route the credential to authentication engine for verification. Authentication engine can generate a system token which can be used whenever a user attempts to execute a process to determine whether the user has the security credentials to run the process or thread. For example when a process or thread attempts to gain access e.g. open close delete and or modify an object e.g. a file setting or an application the thread or process can be authenticated by security subsystem . Security subsystem can check the system token against an access control list associated with the object and determine whether the thread has permission based on a comparison of information in the system token and the access control list. If security subsystem determines that the thread is authorized then the thread can be allowed to access the object.

Continuing with the description of in an embodiment the operating system core can include a graphics display interface GDI and input subsystem . Input subsystem in an example embodiment can be configured to receive user input from a client via the protocol stack instance for the virtual desktop session and send the input to operating system core . The user input can in some embodiments include signals indicative of absolute and or relative mouse movement commands mouse coordinates mouse clicks keyboard signals joystick movement signals etc. User input for example a mouse double click on an icon can be received by the operating system core and the input subsystem can be configured to determine that an icon is located at the coordinates associated with the double click. Input subsystem can then be configured to send a notification to runtime subsystem that can execute a process for the application associated with the icon.

Draw commands can be received from applications and or a desktop and processed by GDI . GDI in general can include a process that can generate graphical object draw commands. GDI in this example embodiment can be configured to pass the commands to remote display subsystem that can instantiate a display driver for the session. In an example embodiment remote display subsystem can be configured to include virtual display driver s that can be configured to receive the draw commands and send them to the client.

Also shown in is a configuration service . In an exemplary embodiment configuration service can be used to setup guest operating system to conduct virtual desktop sessions prior to connection by a client. For example configuration service can run within guest operating system and be executed when guest operating system boots. Since certain configuration settings require administrative privileges configuration service can be configured to run as a process with system wide privileges. Some of the exemplary actions configuration service can take include but are not limited to actions that add an account identifier for the user to a list of administrative users for guest operating system add the account identifier to a list of authorized virtual desktop users set registry values open guest operating system firewalls and open the port that remote presentation engine listens for connections on. Configuration service is described in more detail in the following paragraphs.

In an exemplary embodiment a communication channel can be established between virtualization platform and guest operating system in order to configure and control guest operating system . Since a remote user can have complete control of virtual machine security needs to be in place to ensure that any channel used to configure and control guest operating system can not also be used to attack virtualization platform or other computer systems connected to an internal network. Traditionally a networked communication channel is used to setup and control guest operating system . Network channels however are difficult to deploy when guest operating system is not in the same network domain as virtualization platform and virtualization platform is configured to deny incoming connection requests from outside the domain.

In an exemplary embodiment inter partition communication channel can be used to communicate with configuration server in order to configure and or manage the virtual desktop session. Inter partition communication channel can be configured to be implicitly trusted by virtual machine and not trusted by virtualization platform . In this example information e.g. data and or commands can be easily routed to guest operating system without any need to verify the information. On the other hand data received from virtual machine can be verified and authenticated before virtualization platform takes an action. Moreover because inter partition communication channel does not use networking guest operating system can be kept off the internal network.

Inter partition communication channel can be implicitly trusted by virtual machine i.e. information received via the channel is inherently authenticated validated because only virtualization platform can create inter partition communication channel . For example in an embodiment inter partition communication channel can be implemented at least in part as a region of memory shared between virtual machine and virtualization platform . Virtualization platform can cause a data structure indicative of a ring buffer or the like to be created in region of shared memory that can be used as a full duplex communication channel between virtualization platform and virtual machine . In an exemplary embodiment the inter partition communication channel can include features described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 689 800 entitled Partition bus the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Virtualization platform can write information to inter partition communication channel that can be read by virtual machine . In an exemplary embodiment inter partition communication channel can be message based. That is virtualization platform and virtual machine can be configured to write packets of data to inter partition communication channel . In the same or another exemplary embodiment inter partition communication channel can be event driven. In this configuration when information is written to the channel the receiver can be instructed to read the information from inter partition communication channel by for example hypervisor of .

Turning now to illustrated is a high level block diagram of a datacenter including virtual desktop server virtual desktop server licensing server broker server gateway and client . The datacenter can be configured to deploy virtual desktop sessions to clients. In the illustrated example virtualization platform virtual desktop server licensing server broker server and gateway can be part of an intranet and the user credentials used to log into these computers can be members of the same domain i.e. the infrastructure domain . Infrastructure domain is shown in dashed lines cutting virtual desktop server in half to illustrate that in an exemplary embodiment virtual machine can be part of a different domain or part of no domain.

The datacenter can include an internal network coupling a plurality of virtual desktop servers and which can include components similar to those illustrated by or to broker server and licensing server . As one of skill in the art can appreciate while two virtual desktop servers are shown the datacenter can have many more. Also while virtual desktop server is illustrated running one virtual machine each virtual desktop server can simultaneously host many virtual machines. Or put another way the datacenter can have M where M is an integer greater than 1 virtual desktop servers and each of the M virtualization hosts can host N where N is also an integer greater than 1 virtual machines.

Broker server can act as an interface to the intranet for client . Briefly broker server can include components similar to the components described with respect to . Broker server can have a network adapter that interfaces it to a public network such as the Internet and another network adapter that interfaces it to the internal network i.e. the intranet. In this example broker server can act as a gateway for the internal network thereby allowing virtual desktop servers and licensing server to be kept off the public network.

When user of client wants a virtual desktop session he or she can click on an icon and client can send one or more packets of information to broker server . Broker server can include a module of software instructions that upon execution cause a logical processor to select a suitable virtualization host to instantiate a virtual machine to host the virtual desktop session. A user credential e.g. a username and password combination can be collected and broker server can check session database to determine whether the datacenter includes any disconnected virtual desktop sessions associated with the user credential such as a username password combination. If session database includes a disconnected virtual desktop session associated with the user credential broker server can send a signal to the virtualization host that has the disconnected session and instruct it to execute the virtual machine. If session database does not have information indicative of a disconnected session for the user broker server can select a suitable virtual desktop server e.g. one that has the resources available to instantiate a virtual machine to host a virtual desktop session.

Virtualization platform can instantiate virtual machine and execute guest operating system on a virtual processor. Referring back to guest operating system can run remote presentation engine return an internet protocol IP address of virtual NIC to broker server and await a connection from client . Broker server can return the IP address of virtual NIC to client in a packet of information that causes a logical processor of client to redirect client to the IP address virtual machine . Gateway can receive the connection request and forward it to virtual NIC .

In an least one exemplary embodiment session manager can be configured to check to see if the client is associated with a valid license before starting the virtual desktop session. Remote presentation engine can receive a license from client or information associated with a license and send the information to virtualization platform which can send the license or the information associated with the license to licensing server . Licensing server can include license validation engine which can be configured to determine whether a license associated with client is valid. If the license is valid license validation engine can send a signal back virtual desktop server and a virtual desktop session can be started. At this point remote presentation engine can stream one or more packets of information indicative of a graphical user interface for guest operating system to client and receive one or more packets of information indicative of user input from client .

In an exemplary embodiment when virtualization platform receives a request from broker server to instantiate a virtual machine virtual desktop manager can execute and send commands and or information via inter partition communication channel to virtual machine to cause guest operating system to be configured to conduct a virtual desktop session. Configuration service can receive the commands and or information and configure guest operating system accordingly. For example virtual desktop manager can send the identity of the user attempting to connect desired settings for a firewall protecting guest operating system registry values a list of applications the user is allowed to operate commands to enable virtual desktop sessions and to add the identity of the user to a list of authorized virtual desktop users etc. Configuration service can execute on a virtual processor and change appropriate settings.

Once the virtual desktop session is running virtual desktop manager can manage a running virtual desktop session via inter partition communication channel . For example virtual desktop manager can issue commands to virtual machine such as commands that cause the guest operating system to shut down disconnect the user reset the guest operating system etc. In the same or another embodiment virtual desktop manager can manage the virtual desktop session receive state information for virtual machine status information from remote presentation engine and or send commands to control the virtual desktop session to configuration service . For example virtual desktop manager can receive state information for virtual machine that indicates whether virtual machine is running paused ready booting as well as a list of IP addresses that can be sent to the client. In addition virtual desktop manager can receive status information for guest operating system such as the identity of the user that is logged in for the virtual desktop session and communicate some or all of this information to broker server .

The computers depicted in may be similar to the computer depicted in . In a client communicates with a deployment which comprises authentication server connection broker gateway remote application server farm which in turn comprises two homogenously configured servers remote application servers and VM server farm which in turn comprises two homogenously configured VMs VMs .

Client has a workspace that comprises multiple remote resources served by one or more of remote application servers and VMs . Client may log into its workspace through an authentication server . Once authenticated the client s request to connect to its workspace is transmitted from authentication server to connection broker . Connection broker is configured to broker connections between client and the application servers and VMs that will serve remote resources with client and to effectuate this connection broker is configured to communicate with application servers and VMs to determine what resources they are currently serving including disconnected remote resources for a user of client .

Client may have a workspace that comprises multiple remote resources a remote resource comprising a remote application from remote application server and a remote resource that comprises a VM from VM . As depicted client does not have a remote resource with remote application server or VM . These may each serve different applications or desktops versions of an application or other permutations. For instance remote application server may be serving client with a remoted word processor application and VM may be serving client with a remote desktop.

As can be seen through this depiction when a user wishes to reconnect back to his or her workspace he may desire to reconnect to the remote resources of both remote application server and VM through one command rather than through one command performed three times. The user may perform this reconnect operation from client or from another client computer such as where client is the user s computer at work and the user wishes to reconnect from a computer at home during the weekend .

A user of client has previously had a workspace to remote server farm that involved accessing a remote resource from VM and this workspace is now disconnected. Before client even attempts to reconnect to the deployment authentication server publishes a document via communication to client identifying information about the deployment that client may use to access the remote resources of the deployment . Client later reconnects by sending communication to authentication server . Authentication server validates credentials of the user and or client such as a login and password . Where the credentials are validated authentication server communicates with connection broker to determine which remote resources here VM client is to reconnect to when reconnecting its workspace. Authentication server makes this determination by sending communication to connection broker and in response receiving back in communication a list of server farms here VM farm for client to reconnect to. This information indicated in communication is passed by authentication server to client in communication .

When client has the list of servers to reconnect to from authentication server client reestablishes a communication with each of those server farms. As depicted in that server farm is VM farm . Client communicates with gateway to access the remote resources of these server farms. Gateway processes communication and in turn communicates with connection broker to convey similar information. Connection broker takes the identification of the server farm from communication and from it identifies the machine VM within the farm that has that disconnected remote resource. Connection broker sends communication to VM instructing VM to reconnect the remote resource to client . VM reconnects with client by sending a communication indicative of the same to gateway which in turn sends a communication indicative of the same to client .

It may be appreciated that this is a simplified diagram to emphasize the present invention and that more or fewer server farms may be present and or reconnected to and that the communications passed may be more involved for instance it is shown that communications and establish a reconnection between VM and client where this may also involve communications that are send from client through gateway and to VM .

All of these variations for implementing the above mentioned virtual machines are just exemplary implementations and nothing herein should be interpreted as limiting the disclosure to any particular virtualization aspect.

In a remote presentation or remote desktop environment a licensing mechanism is typically used. Remote presentation systems typically monitor and control access to the various applications that are remotely accessed typically using a licensing model that allows users to use the applications on one or more computers subject to certain terms and conditions. Server applications may require that clients that connect to the server applications have a license to connect to and use the services of that software. If the workstations in an organization are networked to legally access this server software a CAL or client access license may be required. A client access license is a license that gives a user the right to access the services of the server. A server may ensure that a valid client access license is provided by authenticating the license and ensuring that the maximum number of clients for a given application has not been exceeded before allowing access to the application.

Client access licenses may apply to either a device or a user. In Per User mode a client access license is purchased to allow one user to connect to the server software. Any user can connect but only one user may use a given client access license at any given time. Any number of client access licenses can be purchased to allow any number of users to simultaneously connect to the server. Any number of devices may connect to the server software but only a set number of users can connect to and use the software at one time. In the Per User client access license model a client access license can be purchased for every user who accesses the server to use services such as file storage or printing regardless of the number of devices that are used when accessing the service. Purchasing a Per User client access license might be beneficial if for example the company employees need to have roaming access to the corporate network using multiple devices or from unknown devices or simply have more devices than users in the organization.

Per Device mode operates in a similar way but controls the number of connections to those made by devices rather than users. For example one client access license enables one device to connect to and use the server software regardless of how many users are connecting using that device. With a Per Device client access license model a client access license may be purchased for every device that accesses the server regardless of the number of users who use that device to access the server. Per Device client access licenses may make more economic and administrative sense if for example a company has workers who share devices during different work shifts.

A licensing platform typically includes the remote client a remote presentation server and a license server. Typically a client requests a session to the remote presentation server. The remote presentation server may then contact the license server to issue a remote presentation or remote desktop client access license to the remote client. The remote presentation server may also be referred to as the license server client.

A remote presentation licensing platform may be configured to support different types of client access licenses. Typically a features request is received from the license server client and based on the features request the license server can determine the client access license to be issued to the remote client. The license server may be configured to provide feature definitions client access license definitions and client access license issuance orders.

As mentioned many businesses and enterprises operate in a dynamic business environment and it may be desirable that the licensing platform be able to adapt to changes in the environment. However may remote presentation hosts are configured with a predetermined licensing mode either per device or per user or not yet configured. For example the remote client may be configured with a configuration file defining the licensing configuration. The licensing platform license server typically issues different types of client access licenses to the remote client and these licenses are typically per device or per user. Once the licensing mode is set to either per device mode or per user mode the platform will only support the predetermined mode. For example if the platform is set to per device mode all connection to remote presentation host server will consume only per device client access licenses. The same server typically cannot service both per device and per user modes. This may cause users to use multiple servers to service different types of licensing modes.

In some cases if two remote presentation host servers are needed then an extra role hypervisor may be required resulting in reduced performance of the system. Furthermore if multiple remote presentation host servers are needed then multiple applications would be needed for the multiple servers.

Once a per device client access license is installed on the license server the license typically cannot be automatically changed to other license types or versions. For example in a Windows Server context a 2008 Per Device license cannot be changed to a 2008 Per User license or a 2008 Per Device license cannot be changed to a 2003 Per Device license. illustrates one example of an existing licensing model in which a client user must communicate with two different host servers depending on whether the needed license is a per device license or a per user license. A remote presentation host server may either be in per device licensing mode or per user licensing mode A client user device must connect with either a Per Device configured host or a Per User configured host . When the connection request reaches the remote presentation host server in per device licensing mode the per device licensing policy may be executed and a device client access license is requested . In the case of a Per User configured remote presentation host server as part of the connection a per user client access license request is passed to the license server . The license server issues the user client access license and updates the User Object in the Active Directory .

In various embodiments mechanisms are disclosed herein for dynamically switching between the licensing modes on the remote presentation host to process different kinds of licenses. The mode switching may be based on the configuration of the users that are connecting to the remote presentation host. In an embodiment users may be provided with remote presentation session files that define what type of license is to be used for the current connection to the remote presentation host. Such a switching capability may be particularly useful because third party protocol stacks can very easily switch licensing modes on every remote presentation connection.

In some embodiments mechanisms are disclosed to provide the ability to convert a remote client access license from one type to another by using a convertibility matrix.

In an embodiment a remote presentation client may be provided with a remote presentation configuration file. An administrator can supply the remote presentation configuration file by sharing certain types of remote presentation files based on the user types. The remote presentation files can also be configured on a publishing service in the remote presentation web access.

The remote client may send hints to the remote presentation server about what type of license is needed for the current connection. The hints may be passed as part of the capability exchange of the remote presentation protocol. The licensing module in the remote presentation host server may read the hints and switch to the specific licensing policy and perform the validation and issuance of the license in conjunction with the license server.

Referring to users with remote presentation configuration files with a per device hint are shown connecting to a remote presentation host server in per user licensing mode. Although the licensing mode of the server is per user a per device client access license is requested by a user to the licensing server . When clients that provide a per user hint are connected a per user client access license is requested . In this manner users may be able to use server resources to support the changing needs of the enterprise.

With servers incorporating increasing numbers of processor cores server processing power is continuing to increase. For an organization to implement a deployment of Per Device and Per User scenarios the organization would normally have to maintain two separate remote presentation host servers. By using the mechanism described above a connection broker can send remote presentation files to the remote client based on the users licensing configuration. Furthermore a single remote presentation host server can be used to handle two groups of users Per User and Per Device licensed groups.

A request based license mode selection mechanism can also provide ease of configuration because an administrator need not configure licensing modes on remote presentation host servers.

In an embodiment a remote presentation connection with no licensing hints may be configured to use the licensing mode on the remote presentation host server. The remote presentation host server can also be configured to ignore the licensing hints from the remote clients. In particular if one server is configured to handle the entire required workload adding an extra server just to achieve the mixed licensing mode is not cost effective.

In another embodiment the converting of a remote client access license from one type version to another may be accomplished by defining a convertibility matrix. The licensing platform may then provide the ability for administrators to convert client access licenses based on the convertibility matrix.

The convertibility matrix may define which client access licenses are interchangeable or convertible. For example interchangeable client access licenses may be provided for any version of a Per Device license to any version of a Per User license. In the Windows Server context a 2008 Per Device license may be converted to a 2003 Per User license. The table below depicts an example of a convertibility matrix in the Windows Server context.

Any of the above mentioned aspects can be implemented in methods systems computer readable media or any type of manufacture. For example a computer readable storage medium can store thereon computer executable instructions for deploying remote presentation sessions. Such media can comprise a first subset of instructions for receiving a request for a client access license and at least one attribute indicative of a per user licensing mode or a per device licensing mode a second subset of instructions for extracting the at least one attribute and determining based on the at least one attribute that the requested client access license should be issued a third subset of instructions for validating the requested client access license and a fourth subset of instructions for issuing the requested client access license wherein the issued client access license is operable to support the per user licensing mode or the per device licensing mode. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that additional sets of instructions can be used to capture the various other aspects disclosed herein and that the presently disclosed subsets of instructions can vary in detail per the present disclosure.
