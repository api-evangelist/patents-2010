title: Apparatus and method for retaining screw breech block
abstract: A breech-loaded weapon may include a carrier at its breech end. The carrier may include a breech block support. A screw block may be rotatable on the breech block support of the carrier. The carrier may include a supporting protuberance and the screw block may include a supporting projection having an undercut portion. A spring-loaded plunger may be disposed on the carrier and a plunger recess may be defined in the screw block. In a retained position of the screw block, the undercut portion of the supporting projection may engage the supporting protuberance of the carrier and the spring-loaded plunger may engage the plunger recess.

The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

The invention relates in general to munitions and in particular to breech loaded direct and indirect fire weapons such as for example cannons and mortars.

A known method of retaining a screw breech block to the carrier of a cannon or a breech loaded mortar may be accomplished by a spindle and obturator pad assembly. The screw breech block spindle and obturator pad assembly may be all held together by a nut type of component on the threaded breech end of the spindle. When the spindle and obturator pad assembly are removed the screw breech block may no longer be retained. The screw breech block may only remain on the carrier when a horizontal swing breech mechanism is at horizontal elevation. Otherwise for example on a vertical swing cannon the screw block may fall off the carrier.

During the course of daily spindle and seal inspections the screw block may necessarily be removed because it is may not be retained and may otherwise fall off the carrier. Furthermore during reassembly of the spindle extra time may be allotted to re engage the block gear before the spindle and seal assemblies can be reassembled. The traditional removal method for the screw breech block may be tedious and may require a two person team to complete. One person may be needed to remove the spindle and another person may be needed to prevent the screw breech block from falling.

There is a need for a more effective method and apparatus for retaining the screw block to the carrier. A more effective method and apparatus may allow maintenance and inspection of the spindle and obturator assembly to be performed by a single person.

It is an object of the invention to provide a more effective method and apparatus for retaining the screw block to the carrier of a breech loaded weapon.

One aspect of the invention is an apparatus for the breech end of a breech loaded weapon. The apparatus may include a carrier having a breech block support. A screw block may be rotatable on the breech block support of the carrier. A supporting protuberance may be disposed on the carrier. A supporting projection may be disposed on a rear surface of the screw block. The supporting projection may include an undercut portion. A spring loaded plunger may be disposed on the carrier. A plunger recess may be defined in the rear surface of the screw block.

In a retained position of the screw block the undercut portion of the supporting projection may engage the supporting protuberance of the carrier and the spring loaded plunger may engage the plunger recess.

Rotation of the screw block on the breech block support may be constrained by first and second barrier surfaces on the carrier. The supporting projection of the screw block may include a first stop surface. In the retained position of the screw block the first stop surface of the screw block may abut the first barrier surface of the carrier.

The supporting projection of the screw block may include a second stop surface. In a released position of the screw block the second stop surface of the screw block may abut the second barrier surface of the carrier.

In the released position of the screw block the spring loaded plunger may be disengaged from the plunger recess. In the released position of the screw block the undercut portion of the supporting projection may be disengaged from the supporting protuberance of the carrier.

Another aspect of the invention is a breech loaded weapon. The weapon may include a carrier disposed at a breech end of the weapon. The carrier may include a breech block support. A screw block may be rotatable on the breech block support of the carrier. A supporting protuberance may be disposed on the carrier and a supporting projection may be disposed on a rear surface of the screw block. The supporting projection may include an undercut portion. A spring loaded plunger may be disposed on the carrier and a plunger recess may be defined in the rear surface of the screw block.

A further aspect of the invention is a method that may include locking the rotation of a screw block of a weapon by engaging a spring loaded plunger attached to a carrier with a plunger recess in the screw block. The method may include retaining the screw block on the carrier by engaging a supporting protuberance disposed on the carrier with a supporting projection disposed on the screw block.

Retaining the screw block may include engaging the supporting protuberance with an undercut portion of the supporting projection.

The method may further include releasing the screw block by removing the spring loaded plunger from the plunger recess. Releasing the screw block may include rotating the screw block. Rotating the screw block may include disengaging the supporting protuberance from the supporting projection.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

Carrier may include a breech block support . Screw block may be rotatable on breech block support of carrier . A supporting protuberance may be disposed on carrier . Supporting protuberance may be of sufficient strength to support the weight of screw block .

A supporting projection may be disposed on a rear surface of screw block . Supporting projection may include an undercut portion . A spring loaded plunger may be disposed on carrier . A plunger recess may be defined in rear surface of screw block . Rotation of screw block on breech block support may be constrained by first and second barrier surfaces on carrier .

In the retained position of screw block undercut portion of supporting projection may engage supporting protuberance of carrier and spring loaded plunger may engage plunger recess . Supporting projection of screw block may include a first stop surface . In the retained position of screw block first stop surface may abut first barrier surface of carrier . In plunger is extended to lock the rotation of screw block after threads of the screw block have disengaged from a breech ring not shown and before swinging open carrier .

In the retained position of screw block shown in rotation of screw block may be locked by engaging spring loaded plunger attached to carrier with plunger recess in screw block . Screw block may be retained on carrier by engaging supporting protuberance disposed on carrier with supporting projection disposed on screw block . Retaining screw block on carrier may include engaging supporting protuberance with undercut portion of supporting projection .

Screw block may be unlocked or released by removing spring loaded plunger from plunger recess . Spring loaded plunger may be for example manually depressed. Then screw block may be rotated to the released position shown in .

An advantage of the invention is that screw block may be automatically retained. Maintenance of the breech assembly may be safely and quickly performed by one person. Screw block will not fall off until it is manually disengaged.

While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
