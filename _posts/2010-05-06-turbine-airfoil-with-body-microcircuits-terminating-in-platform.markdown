title: Turbine airfoil with body microcircuits terminating in platform
abstract: A turbine engine component includes a platform and one or more microcircuit cooling passages embedded within one or more walls of an airfoil portion of the component. Each microcircuit cooling passage terminates within the thickness of the platform so as to provide cooling to the initial 10% span of the airfoil portion. Each microcircuit cooling passage has an inlet for receiving cooling fluid, which inlet is also embedded within the platform.

The Government of the United States of America may have rights in the present invention as a result of Contract No. F33615 03 D 2354 0009 awarded by the Department of the Air Force.

The present disclosure is directed to a turbine engine component having microcircuit cooling passages that cover the initial 10 span of the airfoil portion and originate in the platform and may provide up to 100 coverage along the entire airfoil.

Gas turbine engines are known and include a compressor which compresses a gas and delivers it into a combustion chamber. The compressed air is mixed with fuel and combusted and products of this combustion pass downstream over turbine rotors.

Gas turbine engines include a compressor which compresses air and delivers it downstream into a combustion section. The air is mixed with fuel in the combustion section and ignited. Products of this combustion pass downstream over turbine rotors which are driven to rotate. In addition static vanes are positioned adjacent to the turbine rotors to control the flow of the products of combustion.

The turbine rotors carry blades. The blades and the static vanes have airfoils extending from platforms. The blades and vanes are subject to extreme heat and thus cooling schemes are utilized for each.

Cooling circuits for turbine engine components have been embedded into the airfoil walls and referred to as microcircuit cooling passages . These cooling circuits however have originated prior to the initial 10 span of an airfoil portion.

In accordance with the present disclosure there is described a microcircuit cooling passage in an airfoil portion of a turbine engine component which cools the initial 10 span of the airfoil portion to manage stress gas flow and heat transfer.

In accordance with the present disclosure there is described a process for forming a turbine engine component which broadly comprises the steps of providing a main core for forming a turbine engine component having a platform and positioning at least one refractory metal core relative to the main core so that a terminal end of said at least one refractory metal core is located in a region where the platform is to be formed.

In accordance with the present disclosure there is described a turbine engine component which broadly comprises an airfoil portion having a platform a pressure side wall a suction side wall and a root portion at least one microcircuit cooling passage embedded within said pressure side wall and or said suction side wall with one central core connected to the microcircuit cooling passage s and each said microcircuit cooling passage providing cooling within an initial 10 span of said airfoil portion. An inlet for the passage may also be located adjacent the initial 10 span or adjacent the platform.

Other details of a microcircuit cooling passage in an airfoil portion of a turbine engine component are set forth in the following detailed description and the accompanying drawings wherein like reference numerals depict like elements.

High heat load applications may require one or more cooling circuits or microcircuits embedded within at least one of the pressure side wall and the suction side wall. These cooling circuits provide cooling and shielding from coolant heat pick up. The cooling circuits are formed during casting by using refractory metal cores to form the passages and shown in . After the blade has been cast the cores are chemically removed leaving the desired cooling circuits. Each of the refractory metal cores and is fabricated so as to create a desired set of fluid passageways with or without a desired set of features such as pedestals for creating turbulence in the cooling flow. The refractory metal cores may be made out of a refractory material such as molybdenum or a molybdenum alloy.

As can be seen from the region or area is not covered by any portion of the microcircuit cooling passages and . Conversely this uncovered area along the airfoil root is subject to high thermal gradients.

As shown in improved resistance to high thermal gradients can be provided by allowing the microcircuit cooling passages and to end in the region of the platform allowing better management of stress gas flow and heat transfer. The microcircuit cooling passages may terminate in a location between the upper surface and the lower surface such as the mid region of the thickness T.

As previously discussed and as shown in the turbine blade has one or more central cores through which cooling fluid flows. Each respective cooling circuit may have an inlet adjacent the terminal end of the cooling circuit in the platform region of the turbine blade which fluidly connects to a respective core . The inlet may be formed using any suitable technique known in the art such as providing a refractory metal core with a curved configuration which forms the inlet .

The microcircuit cooling passages and may be formed from a refractory metal or metal alloy such as molybdenum or a molybdenum alloy. Alternatively each of these microcircuit cooling passages and may be formed from a ceramic or silica material. It is also to be noted that depending on the size of the cooling passages e.g. for larger parts and the part the cooling passages may be formed using conventional ceramic cores in place of some or all of the metal cores.

Referring now to there is shown a flow chart of a process for forming a turbine engine component. In step the refractory metal cores and used to form the cooling passages are manufactured. Any suitable technique may be used to manufacture the cores. In step the refractory metal cores are assembled with the main core. The refractory metal cores are positioned so that a terminal end of each refractory core is located in a region where a platform is to be formed.

In step wax is injected around the assembled cores to form a wax pattern. In step the wax pattern with the cores is dipped in a slurry which coats the wax pattern and forms a shell. After being formed the shell is dried. The wax is then melted away to leave the shell to function as a mold.

In step the turbine engine component is cast by pouring molten material into the mold shell. The molten metal is allowed to solidify. In step the turbine engine component with the cores is removed from the mold. In step the main core and the refractory metal cores are removed. The cores may be removed using any suitable technique known in the art.

While the process of the present disclosure has been described in the context of microcircuit cooling passages in an unshrouded turbine blade the same process and features may also be used for microcircuit cooling passages in other turbine engine components such as static vanes and shrouded blades.

It is apparent that there has been provided a microcircuit cooling passage in an airfoil portion of a turbine engine component. While the present process has been described in the context of specific embodiment s thereof unforeseen alternatives variations and modifications may become apparent to those skilled in the art having read the foregoing description. It is intended to embrace those alternatives modifications and variations as fall within the broad scope of the appended claims.
