The present invention claims priority based on Japanese Patent Application No. 2009 082817 filed in the Japanese Patent Office on Mar. 30 2009. The subject matter of this priority document is incorporated by reference herein.

The present invention relates to a television display method for showing contents such as received programs and web pages on a display of a television TV receiver set and more particularly to an operation method therefor.

A TV receiver is usually equipped with a remote controller. Using the control buttons on the remote controller the user can turn the TV receiver on and off change the channels for broadcast programs record and play back broadcast programs and control the sound volume.

In this connection a technique that the remote controller has a display which can show broadcast programs has been proposed see JP A No. 2004 96361 .

In this technique described in JP A No. 2004 96361 a broadcast program is shown on the display of the remote controller and the user can select channels for broadcast programs independently of the TV receiver so that once the user gets a desired broadcast program the user can have the program shown on the display of the TV receiver as well.

Furthermore in a proposed system which includes a large screen display unit with a display and a portable display unit with a display broadcast programs are shown on the display of the large screen display unit and that of the portable display unit and the broadcast program shown on the large screen display unit can be shown on the portable display unit as well or the broadcast program shown on the portable display unit can be shown on the large screen display unit as well or the broadcast programs shown on the large screen display unit and portable display unit can be exchanged see JP A No. 2003 333359 .

In the technique described in JP A No. 2003 333359 the display of the portable display unit has a touch panel in which a program content combined with a control panel is shown and the user can do operation for the large size display unit by touching the control panel.

In the technique described in JP A No. 2004 96361 the user can select a desired channel or broadcast program while watching a broadcast program on the display of the remote controller and when the selected program is shown on the TV receiver the selected program still remains shown on the remote controller so in order to select another channel or broadcast program the user must repeat the above procedure namely change channels one by one to access and receive the desired program.

In the remote controller with a display the display screen size is limited due to the presence of various control buttons so the screen size for a received program must be small resulting in low operability of the display.

In the technique described in JP A No. 2003 333359 the program shown on the large screen display unit can be shown on the portable display unit as well and also the program shown on the portable display unit can be shown on the large screen display unit in which the display of the portable display unit includes a touch panel to show a program content combined with a control panel so that the user can operate the large screen display unit by touching the control panel. However this control panel may appear or may not appear which means that an additional user operation may be needed.

In order to solve the above problems an object of the present invention is to provide a television operation method whereby a desired content screen can be easily shown on a TV receiver by control operation on the display of a remote terminal.

In order to achieve the above object according to one aspect of the invention there is provided a television display method for a TV receiver equipped with a remote terminal having a display in which control buttons for operation of the TV receiver are provided adjacent to the display of the remote terminal and a remote control screen is shown on the display of the remote terminal to control a content screen shown on the display of the TV receiver.

According to the present invention the display of the remote terminal can show a content screen and if the user wants to transfer the content screen to the TV receiver and have it shown there a screen to enable the user to do so can be shown on the display of the remote terminal so that the user can quickly and easily do operation to have the content screen shown on the display of the TV receiver.

Next the preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail referring to the accompanying drawings.

As illustrated in this embodiment is implemented by a system which includes the controller portable remote terminal connected with it such as a notebook sized personal computer portable terminal or game machine and the TV receiver .

The controller includes the two tuners connected with the antenna the power supply which supplies voltages to various sections of the controller the storage which stores various types of information such as broadcast TV program records the remote control data receiving section which receives operation signals from the remoter controller for example through infrared rays the input output section connected with the TV receiver the communication section connected with the remote terminal and external wired or wireless network and the control section which controls these components and performs various processing tasks.

The tuners and receive broadcast TV programs through specific channels respectively under the control by the control section and a broadcast TV program received by either of the tuners and is sent through the I O section to the TV receiver where its display or TV display shows it. Similarly a broadcast TV program received by either of the tuners and is sent through the communication section to the remote terminal where its display or remote display shows it. In this case the remote terminal and TV receiver can show the same channel broadcast TV program received by the tuner or or show different channel broadcast TV programs.

The remote controller enables the user to change program channels of the TV receiver control the sound volume and give an instruction for recording and or playback and such an operation signal from the remote controller is received by the remote control data receiving section and sent to the control section and the control section processes the signal to generate a control signal such as a channel selection control signal sound volume control signal or recording playback signal and sends it through the I O section to the TV receiver and controls the storage to record or play back a received broadcast TV program. In this way the remote controller is operated to control the TV receiver for various purposes in the same way as in the prior art. The power supply of the controller and the power supply not shown of the TV receiver can be turned on or off by the use of the remote controller in the same way as in the prior art.

The remote terminal which enables the user to operate it for various purposes such as channel selection for the broadcast TV program to be shown on its remote display in the same way as the TV receiver provides a remote control mode for operation of the TV receiver in which the TV receiver can be remotely controlled as with the remoter controller . In addition the broadcast TV channel program shown on the remote display can be shown on the TV receiver and the broadcast TV channel program shown on the remote display and that on the TV display can be exchanged.

Furthermore the communication section enables the user to get a content such as a web page web content from an external system such as the Internet through the network so that the content can be supplied to the TV receiver or remote terminal and shown on the display. Such a web mode is selected by operation of the remote controller or remote terminal .

Furthermore the controller may be built in the TV receiver or a separate unit which is independent of the TV receiver .

In the remote terminal has a display all over its front surface namely the remote display and the various control buttons which are to be touched by the user are located on both sides of the remote display .

Specifically located on the left of the remote display of the remote terminal are the TV Power button Remote Control Mode button Channel Select button Volume Control button and Mute button these control buttons are hereinafter collectively called TV control buttons . By operating any of these control buttons a corresponding operation signal is sent from the remote terminal to the communication section of the controller . In the controller the operation signal received by the communication section is sent to the control section which in turn generates a control signal corresponding to the operation signal and sends it through the I O section to the TV receiver . Thus what is shown on the TV receiver is controlled according to the user s operation of the TV control buttons on the remote terminal .

The TV Power button is used to turn on and off the power to the TV receiver the Remote Control Mode button is a button which enables the user to select broadcast programs recorded programs web contents and menu screens to be shown on the TV receiver these are hereinafter collectively called contents and particularly received programs and recorded programs are called received contents and recorded contents respectively at the remote terminal . The Channel Select button is used to change the channel at the TV receiver and the Volume Control button is used to control the sound volume of the TV receiver and the Mute button is used to mute the sound of the TV receiver .

Located on the right of the remote display are the Send Content button Receive Content button Related Info button Record button Function button and Home button these control buttons are hereinafter collectively called remote control buttons .

The Send Content button is used to let the content shown on the remote display appear on the TV receiver . As this Send Content button is touched content selection information to select the content shown on the remote display is sent together with a corresponding operation signal to the controller and in the controller the communication section receives the operation signal and the control section generates a control instruction signal calling for display of the content based on the operation signal and content selection information and sends it through the I O section to the TV receiver. In this case the received content supplied so far from the tuner or or the recorded content supplied so far from the storage or the web content supplied so far from the network to the remote terminal is sent to the TV receiver under the control of the control section . Consequently at the TV receiver the display content is switched to the selected content. At the same time at the remote terminal the display content is switched to another content.

The Receive Content button is used to let the content shown on the TV display appear on the remote display . As this Receive Content button is touched a corresponding operation signal is sent to the controller and in the controller the communication section receives the operation signal and the control section generates an instruction signal calling for display of the content currently shown on the TV receiver in response to the operation signal and sends it through the communication section to the remote terminal . As the remote terminal receives the instruction signal it acquires or receives the content as specified by the instruction signal and the remote display shows it. In this case the received content supplied so far from the tuner or or the recorded content supplied so far from the storage or the web content supplied so far from the network to the TV receiver is sent to the remote terminal under the control of the control section . Consequently at the remote terminal the display content is switched to the specified content. At the same time at the TV receiver the display content is switched to another content.

The Related Info button is used to show information related to the content shown on the remote display or TV display for example information on a scene in a display content . Such related information may be sent from a broadcaster together with a broadcast content or can be acquired from a website through the network . When the content is recorded in the storage of the controller related information may be recorded at the same time or acquired from a website upon request.

The Record button is used to record the content shown on the remote display or TV display in the storage of the controller .

The Function button is used to specify the degree of brightness and other display parameters for the remote terminal .

The Home button is used to call a menu for content selection on the remote display so that the user can select a desired content.

Next an explanation will be given of an example of flows of screens shown on the remote display and TV display through operation of the remote terminal .

While it is not used the remote terminal should be placed on a terminal rest and turned off. shows that the TV display and the remote display in which the remote display is off and shows nothing. It is assumed here that the TV receiver is also off and thus nothing is shown on the TV display .

In this situation when the user comes within a given distance from the remote terminal in order to use it a sensor not shown built in the remote terminal detects this and the remote terminal is automatically turned on and started. As it starts up an initial screen as illustrated in appears on the remote display . On this initial screen a photo image such as a picture or pattern or an advertisement is shown virtually all over the remote display . If there is a received e mail the mail icon also appears on the screen.

When the user picks up the remote terminal from the terminal rest with the initial screen shown thereon a HOME screen appears on the remote display as illustrated in .

This HOME screen includes an array of option selection touch buttons marked HOME TV EPG and PLAY in which one of these options remains selected for example the HOME option remains selected by default and details of the selected option are shown in the details display area . If it is assumed that the HOME option is selected now content icons including icons for web page browsing and recorded content icons record icons stored in the storage of the controller appear in the details display area in a touchable manner and What s New information or the like appears in the information window .

Though not shown when the EPG option button is touched a broadcast program guide will appear in the details display area . When the PLAY option button is touched a recorded program list appears in the details display area for selection among recorded contents stored in the storage .

In the situation as illustrated in when the user touches the TV Power button at the remote terminal in response to an instruction signal generated by this user operation the controller turns on the TV receiver to start it. This leads to a situation as illustrated in in which the remote display shows and holds the HOME screen and the TV display shows the received program screen shown just before the TV receiver was turned off last namely a received program screen .

If the TV receiver has previously been started the TV display already shows a received program screen e.g. on air program screen and the user need not touch the TV Power button . Therefore the situation as illustrated in is omitted.

A program to be received and shown on the TV display is selected as follows on the HOME screen first the user touches the TV option button which leads to the situation as illustrated in . In this situation while at the TV receiver the TV display shows the received program in the same channel as before the remote terminal acquires thumbnail information about an on air program from the EPG or pertinent information stored in the storage of the controller and the remote display shows a Program Selection screen containing a row of such thumbnails and

On the Program Selection screen for example thumbnails thumbnails and so on representing several on air programs are horizontally arranged in a row in the channel number order in this example three of them are shown on the Program Selection screen . By touching the screen with a fingertip lightly and moving the fingertip on it to the right or left the row of thumbnails is scrolled to the right or left to show thumbnails representing other broadcast programs.

If the user touches a thumbnail for a desired broadcast program for example the thumbnail the remote terminal sends an instruction to receive the broadcast program specified by the thumbnail to the controller and in the controller one of the tuners and which is not engaged in receiving a broadcast program starts receiving the specified broadcast program and the program thus received is sent to the remote terminal . Consequently at the remote terminal a received program screen appears all over the remote display in which the received program as specified above is shown in enlarged form as illustrated in . Even at this time the TV receiver still continues to receive and show the program received so far.

By touching the remote display while the received program screen is shown on the remote display as illustrated in it returns to the Program Selection screen as illustrated in in which the user can select another channel program. Or by making a scrolling motion in the same manner as on the Program Selection screen as illustrated in while the received program screen is shown at the remote terminal as illustrated in the user can change the received program shown on the received program screen . In this case in response to this scrolling motion a channel change instruction signal is sent to the controller and the controller changes the channel or program to be received by the tuner or which has been used for the remote terminal .

When the Send Content button is touched while the TV display and the remote display show different received program screens and respectively as illustrated in the displays and change to the display situation as illustrated in .

In this display situation the received program screen shown on the remote display as illustrated in replaces the received program screen on the TV display by the abovementioned channel change operation under the control by the controller and at the remote terminal the program reception remote control screen appears on the remote display to enable selection of a program to be received and shown on the TV display . In this case on the TV display and remote display the respective current screens scroll up and disappear and new screens scroll up and appear from below. Screen changes in other cases which will be described later are also made similarly unless otherwise specified.

The program reception remote control screen contains tabs for keywords which express broadcasting types such as Terrestrial digital BS Broadcasting Satellite and CS Communication Satellite i.e. TERRESTRIAL tab BS tab and CS tab . The user selects one of them and a page corresponding to the selected tab tabs and so on appears. The page contains touchable or selectable program icons for currently available broadcast programs of the broadcasting type corresponding to the keyword represented by the tab .

One of the program icons in the page is selected with the cursor as illustrated in and the TV receiver receives the program corresponding to the program icon selected with the cursor and shows it on the TV display . If the user touches another program icon not selected with the cursor the cursor moves to that program icon and the TV receiver receives the program corresponding to the program icon newly selected with the cursor and a corresponding program screen replaces the received program screen received so far. Therefore the cursor represents a program which the TV receiver is currently receiving.

When the user touches the Send Content button so as to let the content in this case a received program thus selected on the remote display appear on the TV display the remote display shows an operation screen suitable for the content being currently shown on the TV display in this case the program reception remote control screen so that the user can do operation for that content easily and conveniently.

Like an ordinary web page the page has a Close button in the top right corner upon touching the Close button or the home button the program reception remote control screen disappears and the HOME screen as illustrated in appears again. On the other hand at the TV receiver the received program screen remains shown.

When the user wants to get information related to the received program shown on the TV display in the display situation as illustrated in the user should touch the Related Info button . In this case as illustrated in while the received program screen remains shown on the TV display of the TV receiver the remote display shows a related web screen which contains tabs for the related options. Here assuming that the tabs include the Related Web tab Related Program tab and Program Info tab one of these tabs is selected and a corresponding web page appears. In this example on the assumption that the Related Web tab is selected the web page appears in which information related to the received program screen shown on the TV display is shown.

Here related information means information about facilities such as shops and places of interest such as parks to which references are made in the content in this case the received program screen . Such related information is acquired and supplied by the controller as mentioned earlier.

The page in this case a web page contains select buttons for options Dictionary Shop and Map so that the user can select one of them by touching it in order to change what is shown on the page from the related information to information from a dictionary or information on a shop or a map including the location of a relevant shop. In addition the Full Screen button is also provided to enlarge and show the page all over the remote display . Furthermore like an ordinary web page the page has a Close button in the top right corner upon touching the Close button the program reception remote control screen as illustrated in appears again.

Next when the user touches the Send Content button in the display situation as illustrated in the related web screen shown so far on the remote display appears on the TV display as it is and a web remote control screen which functions as a touch pad appears on the remote display . The related web screen on the TV display contains a cursor and this cursor can be moved by operating the touch pad on the web remote control screen on the remote display . This means that the user can operates the related web screen on the TV display by operation of the touch pad on the web remote control screen on the remote display .

Here when the user touches the Function button while the remote display shows the web remote control screen a browser button not shown appears and when the Home button is touched the screen shown on the remote display is changed to the HOME screen as illustrated in .

Again when the user touches the Send Content button so as to let the content in this case a related web screen selected on the remote display appear on the TV display the remote display shows an operation screen suitable for the content being currently shown on the TV display in this case the web remote control screen so that the user can do operation for that content easily and conveniently.

If the remote display shows a screen other than the program reception remote control screen as illustrated in by touching the Remote Control Mode button the program reception remote control screen can be shown on the remote display as illustrated in . Therefore even in that case the user can do various operations as illustrated in .

For example when the user touches the Receive Content button at the remote terminal in the display situation as illustrated in the related web screen shown on the TV display is transferred to the remote display and the TV receiver again shows the screen which was shown just before the related web screen in this case the received program screen . illustrates the above mentioned display situation that the screen shown on the TV display is transferred to the remote display by touching the Receive Content button

For example if the user touches the Home button at the remote terminal in the display situation as illustrated in the remote display shows a HOME screen similar to the HOME screen as illustrated in leading to the display situation as illustrated in in which the user can do operation in the same way as with the HOME screen .

For example if the user touches a content icon for a desired recorded content on the HOME screen in the display situation as illustrated in the screen recorded content screen for the recorded content played back from the storage of the controller such a content as a recorded program or recorded web page is shown all over the remote display as illustrated in . Again the screen shown on the TV display remains unchanged namely the received program screen remains shown.

When the user touches the Send Content button at the remote terminal in the display situation as illustrated in the recorded content playback screen shown on the remote display is transferred to the TV receiver and the TV display shows the recorded content playback screen as illustrated in . At the same time the remote display shows the playback remote control screen which contains playback operation buttons for Playback Stop Pause Fast forward and Rewind a playback progress bar and playback related images showing playback scenes at different times so that by touching any of these operation buttons a corresponding operation signal is sent from the remote terminal to the controller in which the control section controls operation of the storage to enable various playback operations on the remote display . The remote terminal thus functions as a remote controller for playback of a recorded content.

Again when the user touches the Send Content button so as to let the content in this case a recorded content playback screen selected on the remote display appear on the TV display the remote display shows an operation screen suitable for the content being currently shown on the TV display in this case the playback remote control screen so that the user can do operation for that content easily and conveniently.

The playback remote control screen contains a Close button upon touching the Close button at the remote terminal the HOME screen the HOME screen in or the HOME screen in appears on the remote display . On the other hand the TV receiver continues playback or continues showing the recorded content playback screen .

When the user touches the Stop button among the playback operation buttons on the playback remote control screen shown on the remote display in the display situation as illustrated in the TV receiver returns to the program receiving state in which it was just before the appearance of the recorded content playback screen or a received program screen is shown on the TV display as illustrated in .

Also the remote terminal shows a program reception remote control screen similar to the program reception remote control screen in so that the user can select a program or change the program at the TV receiver as explained earlier in reference to .

When the recorded content playback screen is replaced by the received program screen on the TV display as illustrated in in response to this replacement the playback remote control screen is also replaced by the program reception remote control screen on the remote display so the user can do operation for the content shown on the TV display easily and smoothly.

Thus like the remote controller the remote terminal has a function to enable the user to play back recorded contents and select channels for programs to be received.

When the user touches the Close button on the program reception remote control screen shown on the remote display in the display situation as illustrated in the remote display shows the Home screen as illustrated in as when the user touches the Close button on the program reception remote control screen at the remote terminal . In this case as well at the TV receiver the received program screen which has been shown so far on the TV display remains there as it is.

As discussed above in this embodiment by operating the control buttons of the remote terminal and touching screens shown there the user can select broadcast programs web pages and recorded contents and get related information and transfer contents screens between the remote terminal and the TV receiver .

The flows of screens concerned in various operation sequences have been explained so far. Also various screens can be shown similarly by using the control buttons of the remote terminal as illustrated in . The operation sequences involved with these control buttons are explained below.

In the latter case by touching the Send Content button the content screen is transferred to the TV display and shown there as mentioned above. Therefore by touching a content button in a manner indicated in a content screen can be shown on the TV display directly without touching the Send Content button

As described above in this embodiment by using the remote terminal the user can do operation for various contents such as received programs web pages and recorded contents to be shown on the display of the TV receiver or the TV display and transfer various screens between the remote display and TV display .

The second embodiment is different from the first embodiment in that the user s line of sight can be used in operation for transferring various screens between the remote display and TV display . The rest is the same as in the first embodiment.

Referring to the camera is located on the top of the remote display of the remote terminal in a way that the camera takes an image of an area ahead of the remote display . The image thus taken is transmitted to the controller and sent to its control section where it is processed.

As illustrated in when the user holds the remote terminal in his her hand the camera takes an image of an area including the face of the user and if both the eyes of the user are within a prescribed area in the imaging range of the camera the control section of the controller detects the image of the eyes and detects the movement of the line of sight from the movement of the eyes. The area in which the eyes can be detected is an area which includes the image of the eyes in the imaging range of the camera when the user looks at the remote display with his her face right in front of it. Here assuming that a content for example the received program screen is shown on the remote display if the control section of the controller detects that the line of sight is directed straight toward the front of the remote display the displays remain unchanged or the received program screen remains shown on the remote display and the current screen not shown remains shown on the TV display of the TV receiver .

On the other hand if in order to let the received program screen currently shown on the remote display appear on the TV display as illustrated in the user directs his her line of sight toward the remote display for a given time duration and then moves and holds the line of sight toward a specific direction with respect to the remote display for example upward for a given time duration the control section of the controller detects this and determines that it receives an instruction from the remote terminal to transfer the received program screen to the TV display and lets the TV display show the received program screen

In order to transfer the received program screen from the remote display to the TV display in this way the user must hold the remote display in a way to make it parallel to the TV display and if the user directs his her line of sight toward an upward direction with respect to the remote display it means that the line of sight is directed toward the TV display . In other words if after the line of sight is directed toward the remote display for a given time duration it is moved and directed toward the TV display for a given time duration as mentioned above this movement of the line of sight is interpreted to express an intention to transfer the received program screen from the remote display to the TV display . This will give the user feeling as if he she transferred it through his her line of sight . Also if the line of sight is held directed toward the TV display for a given time duration it indicates that the user intends that the received program screen thus transferred be shown on the TV display . This will give the user feeling as if he she placed the received program screen transferred by his her line of sight on the TV display

After the received program screen is transferred from the remote display to the TV display in this way the remote display shows another screen for example the program reception remote control screen as illustrated in .

In addition in the display situation as illustrated in if the user s line of sight is directed toward the TV display or an upward direction with respect to the remote display for a given time duration or more and then directed toward the remote display a given time after that the received program screen shown on the TV display is transferred to the remote display . In this case the TV display returns to the screen which was shown just before the received program screen

Another concrete example may be as follows even if the line of sight is directed toward the TV display for a given time duration and then directed towards the remote display the received program screen shown on the TV display is not transferred to the remote display and the program reception remote control screen as illustrated in is shown instead. This means that the program reception remote control screen can be shown without manual operation.

In this case as well if the user s line of sight is directed toward the TV display or an upward direction with respect to the remote display for a given time duration or more and then directed toward the remote display after this situation is held for a given time duration the remote display returns to the related web screen .

It should be understood by those skilled in the art that various modifications combinations sub combinations and alterations may occur depending on design requirements and other factors insofar as they are within the scope of the appended claims or the equivalents thereof.
