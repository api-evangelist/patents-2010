The Wnt gene family encodes a large class of secreted proteins related to the Int1 Wnt1 proto oncogene and wingless Wg a Wnt1 homologue Cadigan et al. 1997 Genes Development 11 3286 3305 . Wnts are expressed in a variety of tissues and organs and play a major role in many developmental processes including segmentation in endoderm development in and establishment of limb polarity neural crest differentiation kidney morphogenesis sex determination and brain development in mammals Parr et al. 1994 Curr. Opinion Genetics Devel. 4 523 528 . The Wnt pathway is a master regulator in animal development both during embryogenesis and in the mature organism Eastman et al. 1999 Curr Opin Cell Biol 11 233 240 Peifer et al. 2000 Science 287 1606 1609 .

Wnt signals are transduced by the Frizzled Fz family of seven transmembrane domain receptors Bhanot et al. 1996 Nature 382 225 230 . Wnt ligands bind to Fzd and in so doing activate the cytoplasmic protein Dishevelled Dvl 1 2 and 3 in humans and mice Boutros et al. 1999 Mech Dev 83 27 37 and phosphorylate LRP5 6. A signal is thereby generated which prevents the phosphorylation and degradation of Armadillo beta catenin in turn leading to the stabilization of catenin Perrimon 1994 Cell 76 781 784 . This stabilization is occasioned by Dvl s association with axin Zeng et al. 1997 Cell 90 181 192 a scaffolding protein that brings various proteins together including GSK3 APC CK1 and catenin to form the catenin destruction complex.

The Wingless type Wnt Frizzled protein receptor pathway involves important regulatory genes that carry polymorphisms associated with primary carcinomas. In the course of downstream signaling cytosolic catenin accumulates translocates into the nucleus and then enhances gene expression by complexing with other transcription factors Uthoff et al. 31 56 62 2001 . In the absence of Wnt signals free cytosolic catenin is incorporated into a complex consisting of Axin the adenomatous polyposis coli APC gene product and glycogen synthase kinase GSK 3 . Conjunctional phosphorylation of Axin APC and catenin by GSK 3 designates catenin for the ubiquitin pathway and degradation by proteasomes Uthoff et al. 31 56 62 2001 Matsuzawa et al. 7 915 926 2001 .

Disheveled Dvl is a positive mediator of Wnt signalling positioned downstream of the frizzled receptors and upstream of catenin. GSK 3 phosphorylates several proteins in the Wnt pathway and is instrumental in the downstream regulation of catenin. Mutations in the gene APC are an initiating event for both sporadic and hereditary colorectal tumorigenesis. APC mutants are relevant in tumorigenesis since the aberrant protein is an integral part of the Wnt signaling cascade. The protein product contains several functional domains acting as binding and degradation sites for catenin. Mutations that occur in the amino terminal segment of catenin are usually involved in phosphorylation dependent ubiquitin mediated degradation and thus stabilize catenin. When stabilized cytoplasmic catenin accumulates it translocates to the nucleus interacting with the Tcf Lef high mobility group of transcription factors that modulate expression of oncogenes such as c myc.

It is known that Wnt catenin signaling promotes cell survival in various cell types Orford et al. 146 855 868 1999 Cox et al. 155 1725 1740 2000 Reya et al. 13 15 24 2000 Satoh et al. 24 245 250 2000 Shin et al. 274 2780 2785 1999 Chen et al. 152 87 96 2001 Ioannidis et al. 2 691 697 2001 . Wnt signaling pathway is also thought to be associated with tumor development and or progression Polakis et al. 14 1837 1851 2000 Cox et al. 155 1725 1740 2000 Bienz et al. 103 311 320 2000 You et al. 157 429 440 2002 . Aberrant activation of the Wnt signaling pathway is associated with a variety of human cancers correlating with the over expression or amplification of c Myc Polakis et al. 14 1837 1851 2000 Bienz et al. 103 311 320 2000 Brown et al. 3 351 355 2001 He et al. 281 1509 1512 1998 Miller et al. 18 7860 7872 1999 . In addition c Myc was identified as one of the transcriptional targets of the catenin Tcf in colorectal cancer cells He et al. 281 1509 1512 1998 de La Coste et al. 95 8847 8851 1998 Miller et al. 18 7860 7872 1999 You et al. 157 429 440 2002 .

The invention also provides for a method of inhibiting Wnt signaling in a cell comprising contacting the cell with an effective amount of a Wnt antagonist. In one embodiment the cell is contained within a mammal and the administered amount is a therapeutically effective amount. In one embodiment the inhibition of Wnt signaling further results in the inhibition of the growth of the cell. In a further embodiment the cell is a cancer cell.

Inhibition of cell proliferation is measured using methods known to those skilled in the art. For example a convenient assay for measuring cell proliferation is the CellTiter Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay which is commercially available from Promega Madison Wis. . That assay determines the number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of ATP present which is an indication of metabolically active cells. See Crouch et al 1993 160 81 88 U.S. Pat. No. 6 602 677. The assay may be conducted in 96 or 384 well format making it amenable to automated high throughput screening HTS . See Cree et al 1995 6 398 404. The assay procedure involves adding a single reagent CellTiter Glo Reagent directly to cultured cells. This results in cell lysis and generation of a luminescent signal produced by a luciferase reaction. The luminescent signal is proportional to the amount of ATP present which is directly proportional to the number of viable cells present in culture. Data can be recorded by luminometer or CCD camera imaging device. The luminescence output is expressed as relative light units RLU . Inhibition of cell proliferation may also be measured using colony formation assays known in the art.

Furthermore the invention provides for methods of treating a Wnt mediated disorder in a mammal suffering therefrom comprising administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of a Wnt antagonist. In one embodiment the disorder is a cell proliferative disorder associated with aberrant e.g. increased expression of activity of Wnt signaling. In another embodiment the disorder results from increased expression of a Wnt protein. In yet another embodiment the cell proliferative disorder is cancer such as for example colon cancer colorectal cancer breast cancer cancer associated with various disorders relating to HSC s such as leukemias and various other blood related cancers and cancer related to neuronal proliferative disorders including brain tumors such as gliomas astrocytomas meningiomas Schwannomas pituitary tumors primitive neuroectodermal tumors PNET medulloblastomas craniopharyngioma pineal region tumors and skin cancers including basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma.

Treatment of the cell proliferative disorder by administration of a Wnt antagonist results in an observable and or measurable reduction in or absence of one or more of the following reduction in the number of cancer cells or absence of the cancer cells reduction in the tumor size inhibition of cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs including the spread of cancer into soft tissue and bone inhibition of tumor metastasis inhibition to some extent of tumor growth and or relief to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the specific cancer reduced morbidity and mortality and improvement in quality of life issues. To the extent the Wnt antagonist may prevent growth and or kill existing cancer cells it may be cytostatic and or cytotoxic. Reduction of these signs or symptoms may also be felt by the patient.

The above parameters for assessing successful treatment and improvement in the disease are readily measurable by routine procedures familiar to a physician. For cancer therapy efficacy can be measured for example by assessing the time to disease progression TDP and or determining the response rate RR . Metastasis can be determined by staging tests and by bone scan and tests for calcium level and other enzymes to determine spread to the bone. CT scans can also be done to look for spread to the pelvis and lymph nodes in the area. Chest X rays and measurement of liver enzyme levels by known methods are used to look for metastasis to the lungs and liver respectively. Other routine methods for monitoring the disease include transrectal ultrasonography TRUS and transrectal needle biopsy TRNB . In a specific embodiment the administration of Wnt antagonist decreases tumor burden e.g. reduces size or severity of the cancer . In yet another specific embodiment the administration of Wnt antagonist kills the cancer.

The present invention relates to compositions and methods for modulating the Wnt signaling pathway. In particular embodiments the present invention provides compositions and methods that inhibit Wnt signal transduction activity by modulating activation of the Wnt pathway thereby treating diagnosing preventing and or ameliorating Wnt signaling related disorders.

The current paradigm for developing therapies for Wnt signaling related disorders relies on targeting cat or Wnt pathway components downstream of cat. Recent studies however suggest that inhibition of the extracellular ligand receptor interaction component is effective in reducing the tumorigenicity even though the event initiating the Wnt signaling may have occurred downstream. Moreover the transfection of inoperative frizzled receptor Frz7 ectodomain into carcinoma cell line SK CO 1 restored a normal catenin phenotype. This cell line has active Wnt signaling due to a homozygous APC mutation. Such cells also did not demonstrate tumor formation when transferred in vivo. Vincan et al. Differentiation 2005 73 142 153. This demonstrates that the inhibition of Wnt signaling at the extracellular level can downregulate Wnt signaling resulting from activation of a downstream intracellular Wnt signaling pathway component. This further suggests that inhibitors of the Wnt signaling pathway may be used in the treatment of any Wnt mediated disorder regardless of the particular manner in which Wnt signaling has been activated.

Deregulation of the Wnt signaling pathway may be caused by somatic mutations in genes encoding various Wnt signaling pathway components. For example aberrant Wnt signaling activity has been associated with Wnt ligand overexpression in non small cell lung cancer NSCLC You et al. 2004 23 6170 6174 chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL Lu et al. 2004 101 3118 3123 gastric cancer Kim et al. 2003 25 211 215 Saitoh et al. 2002 9 515 519 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma HNSCC Rhee et al. 2002 21 6598 6605 colorectal cancer Holcombe et al. 2002 55 220 226 ovarian cancer Ricken et al. 2002 143 2741 2749 basal cell carcinoma BCC Lo Muzio et al. 2002 22 565 576 and breast cancer. Moreover the reduction of various Wnt ligand regulatory molecules such as sFRP and WIF 1 have been associated with breast cancer Klopocki et al. 2004 25 641 649 Ugolini et al. 2001 20 5810 5817 Wissmann et al. 2003 201 204 212 bladder cancer Stoehr et al. 2004 84 465 478 Wissmann et al. supra mesothelioma Lee et al. 2004 23 6672 6676 colorectal cancer Suzuki et al. 2004 36 417 422 Kim et al. 2002 1 1355 1359 Caldwell et al. 2004 64 883 888 prostate cancer Wissman et al. supra NSCLC Mazieres et al. 2004 64 4717 4720 and lung cancer Wissman et al. supra .

Aberrant Wnt signaling resulting from overexpression of various components of the Frz LRP receptor complex have also been associated with certain cancers. For example LRP5 overexpression has been associated with osteosarcoma Hoang et al. 2004 109 106 111 while Frz overexpression has been associated with cancers such as prostate Wissmann et al. supra HNSCC Rhee et al. 2002 21 6598 6605 colorectal Holcombe et al. supra ovarian cancer Wissman et al. supra esophageal Tanaka et al. 1998 95 10164 10169 and gastric Kirikoshi et al. 2001 19 111 115 . Additionally overexpression of Wnt signaling pathway components such as Dishevelled have been associated with cancers such as prostate Wissman et al supra breast Nagahata et al. 2003 94 515 518 mesothelioma Uematsu et al. 2003 63 4547 4551 and cervical Okino et al 2003 10 1219 1223 . Frat 1 overexpression has been associated with cancers such as pancreatic esophageal cervical breast and gastric. Saitoh et al. 2002 20 785 789 Saitoh et al. 2001 19 311 315 . Axin loss of function LOF mutations have been associated with hepatocellular cancer Satoh et al. 2000 24 245 250 Taniguchi et al. 2002 21 4863 4871 and medulloblastoma Dahmen et al. 2001 61 7039 7043 Yokota et al. 2002 101 198 201 .

Furthermore a multitude of cancers has been associated with activating catenin through disruption of the degradation complex such as gain of function mutations in catenin or loss of function mutations in APC. A reduction in the degradation of catenin results in greater amounts of functional catenin in the cell which then causes increased transcription of the target genes resulting in aberrant cell proliferation. For example mutations in the gene encoding catenin i.e. CTNNB1 have been associated with cancers such as gastric Clements et al. 2002 62 3503 3506 Park et al. 1999 59 4257 4260 colorectal Morin et al. 1997 275 1787 1790 Ilyas et al. 1997 94 10330 10334 intestinal carcinoid Fujimori et al. 2001 61 6656 6659 ovarian Sunaga et al. 2001 30 316 321 pulmonary adenocarcinoma Sunaga et al. supra endometrial Fukuchi et al. 1998 58 3526 3528 Kobayashi et al. 1999 90 55 59 Mirabelli Primdahl et al. 1999 59 3346 3351 hepatocellular Satoh et al. supra.

While loss of function mutations have been associated with cancers such as colorectal Fearon et al. 1990 61 759 767 Rowan et al. 2000 97 3352 3357 melanoma Reifenberger et al. 2002 100 549 556 Rubinfeld et al. 1997 275 1790 1792 medulloblastoma Koch et al. 2001 93 445 449 Huang et al. 2000 156 433 437 and desmoids Tejpar et al. 1999 18 6615 6620 Alman et al. 1997 151 329 334 .

Other disorders associated with aberrant Wnt signaling include but are not limited to osteoporosis osteoarthritis polycystic kidney disease diabetes schizophrenia vascular disease cardiac disease non oncogenic proliferative diseases and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer s disease.

Aberrant Wnt pathway activation through the stabilization of catenin plays a central role in tumorigenesis for many colorectal carcinomas. It is estimated that 80 of colorectal carcinomas CRCs harbor inactivating mutations in the tumor repressor APC which allows for uninterrupted Wnt signaling. Furthermore there is a growing body of evidence that suggests that the Wnt pathway activation may be involved in melanoma breast liver lung gastric cancer and other cancers.

Unregulated activation of the Wnt signaling pathway is also a precursor to the development of leukemia. Experimental evidence exists supporting the oncogenic growth of both myeloid and lymphoid lineages as dependent on Wnt signaling. Wnt signaling has been implicated in regulating both the chronic and acute forms of myeloid leukemia. Granulocyte macrophage progenitors GMPs from chronic myelogenous leukemia patients and blast crisis cells from patients resistant to therapy display activated Wnt signaling. Moreover inhibition of catenin through ectopic expression of Axin decreases the replating capacity of leukemic cells in vitro suggesting that chronic myelogenous leukemia precursors are dependent on Wnt signaling for growth and renewal. Wnt overexpression also caused GMPs to acquire stem cell like properties of long term self renewal supporting the hypothesis that Wnt signaling is important for the normal development of blood lineages but that aberrant Wnt signaling results in the transformation of progenitor cells.

Recent studies also suggest that lymphoid neoplasias may also be influenced by Wnt signaling. Wnt 16 is overexpressed in pre B cell leukemia cell lines carrying the E2A PbX translocation suggesting that autocrine Wnt activity may contribute to oncogenesis. McWhirter et al. 96 11464 11469 1999 . The role of Wnt signaling in the growth and survival of normal B cell progenitors further supports this notion. Reya et al. 13 15 24 2000 Ranheim et al. 105 2487 2494 2005 . Autocrine dependence on Wnt has also been proposed for regulating the growth of multiple myeloma a cancer of terminally differentiated B cells. Derksen et al. 101 6122 6127 2004 . Primary myelomas and myeloma cell lines were also found to express stabilized i.e. independent of degradation complex . Although no mutations in Wnt signaling components was present the overexpression of several components including Wnt 5A and Wnt 10B suggest that tumor dependency and cancer self renewal is not necessarily dependent on mutations appearing in Wnt signaling pathway components but rather only upon constitutive activation of the pathway itself.

The transition of self renewing pluripotent stem cells to myeloid progenitors is accompanied by the downregulation of Wnt signaling. Reya et al 423 409 414 2003 . Similarly the stable expression of catenin in lymphoid progenitors restored multiple differentiation options albeit such cells lacked markers typically associated with either cell type. Baba et al 23 599 609 2005 .

It has also been observed that the activation of Wnt signaling through catenin can increase cycling and expansion of neural progenitors and that loss of such signaling can result in a loss of progenitor compartment. Chenn et al. 297 365 369 2002 Zechner et al. 258 406 418 2003 . Just as normal activation of Wnt signaling may promote self renewal of neuronal stem cells aberrant Wnt pathway activation may be tumorigenic in the nervous system. Experimental evidence supporting this conclusion is the discovery that medulloblastoma a pediatric brain tumor of the cerebellum contains mutations in both catenin and Axin thereby suggesting that medulloblastomas arise from primitive progenitors that become transformed in response to uncontrolled Wnt signaling. Zurawel et al. 58 896 899 1998 Dahmen et al. 61 7039 7043 2001 Baeza et al. 22 632 636 2003 . Thus it is strongly suggested that the inhibition of Wnt signaling by the Wnt antagonists of the invention may be an effective therapeutic in the treatment of various neuronal proliferative disorders including brain tumors such as gliomas astrocytomas meningiomas Schwannomas pituitary tumors primitive neuroectodermal tumors PNET medulloblastomas craniopharyngioma pineal region tumors and non cancerous neurofibromatoses.

Hematopoietic stem cells give rise to the adult blood cells of the circulatory system in a process of lineage committed progenitor cells from multipotential hematopoietic stem cells HSC . It is also apparent that Wnt signaling contributes to the self renewal and maintenance of HSC s and that dysfunctional Wnt signaling is responsible for various disorders resulting from HSC s such as leukemias and various other blood related cancers. Reya et al. 434 843 850 2005 Baba et al. 23 599 609 2005 Jamieson et al. 351 7 657 667 2004 . Wnt signaling is normally reduced as stem cells convert to committed myeloid progenitor cells. Reya et al. 423 409 414 2003 .

Not only are Wnt ligands themselves produced by HSC s but Wnt signaling is also active thereby suggesting autocrine or paracrine regulation. Rattis et al. 11 88 94 2004 Reya et al. Nature 423 409 414 2003 . Additionally both catenin and Wnt3a promote self renewal of murine HSCs and progenitor cells while application of Wnt 5A to human hematopoietic progenitors promotes the expansion of undifferentiated progenitors in vitro. Reya et al. supra. Willert et al. 423 448 452 2003 Van Den Berg et al. 92 3189 3202 1998 .

In addition to HSC s it is apparent that embryonic stem cells epidermal stem cells and epithelial stem cells are responsive or dependent on Wnt signaling for maintenance in an undifferentiated proliferating state. Willert et al. supra Korinek et al. 19 379 383 1998 Sato et al. 10 55 63 2004 Gat et al. 95 605 614 1998 Zhu et al. 126 2285 2298 1999 . Therefore the inhibition of Wnt signaling with the Wnt antagonists of the present invention may be a therapeutic in the treatment of disorders resulting from dysfunctional hematopoieses such as leukemias and various blood related cancers such as acute chronic lymphoid and myelogenous leukemias myelodysplastic syndrome and myeloproliferative disorders. These include myeloma lymphoma e.g. Hodgkin s and non Hodgkin s chronic and nonprogressive anemia progressive and symptomatic blood cell deficiencies polycythemia vera essential or primary thrombocythemia idiopathic myelofibrosis chronic myelomonocytic leukemia CMML mantle cell lymphoma cutaneous T cell lymphoma Waldenstrom macroglobinemia 

The Wnt signaling pathway may also play a critical role in aging and age related disorders. As reported in Brack A S et al. 317 5839 807 10 2007 muscle stem cells from aged mice were observed to convert from a myogenic to a fibrogenic lineage as they begin to proliferate. This conversion is associated with an increase in canonical Wnt signaling pathway activity in aged myogenic progenitors and can be suppressed by Wnt inhibitors. Additionally components of serum from aged mice bind to the Frizzled proteins and may account for the elevated Wnt signaling in aged cells. Injection of Wnt3A into young regenerating muscle reduced proliferation and increased deposition of connective tissue.

The Wnt signaling pathway has been further implicated in aging process in studies using the Klotho mouse model of accelerated aging in which it was determined that the Klotho protein physically interacted with and inhibited Wnt proteins. Liu H et al. Science 317 5839 803 6 2007 . In a cell culture model the Wnt Klotho interaction resulted in the suppression of Wnt biological activity while tissues and organs from Klotho deficient animals showed evidence of increased Wnt signaling.
