title: Printhead having nozzles with stacked capacitive actuators
abstract: A printhead is provided having a fluid ejection nozzles which each have a substrate, a layer of drive circuitry deposited on the substrate, and subsequent etchant layers deposited on the drive circuitry to define a nozzle chamber with walls and a roof structure defining a fluid ejection port. Each nozzle also has a stacked capacitive actuator arranged in the chamber. The actuator has alternate electrode plates sandwiched between a compressible polymer, wherein activation of the stacked actuator draws the electrode plates together to compress the polymer storing energy therein, with subsequent de-activation releasing the energy to eject fluid within the chamber from the ejection port.

Many different types of printing have been invented a large number of which are presently in use. The known forms of print have a variety of methods for marking the print media with a relevant marking media. Commonly used forms of printing include offset printing laser printing and copying devices dot matrix type impact printers thermal paper printers film recorders thermal wax printers dye sublimation printers and ink jet printers both of the drop on demand and continuous flow type. Each type of printer has its own advantages and problems when considering cost speed quality reliability simplicity of construction and operation etc.

In recent years the field of ink jet printing wherein each individual pixel of ink is derived from one or more ink nozzles has become increasingly popular primarily due to its inexpensive and versatile nature.

Many different techniques of ink jet printing have been invented. For a survey of the field reference is made to an article by J Moore Non Impact Printing Introduction and Historical Perspective Output Hard Copy Devices Editors R Dubeck and S Sherr pages 207 220 1988 .

Ink Jet printers themselves come in many different forms. The utilization of a continuous stream of ink in ink jet printing appears to date back to at least 1929 wherein U.S. Pat. No. 1 941 001 by Hansell discloses a simple form of continuous stream electro static ink jet printing.

U.S. Pat. No. 3 596 275 by Sweet also discloses a process of continuous ink jet printing including a step wherein the ink jet stream is modulated by a high frequency electro static field so as to cause drop separation. This technique is still utilized by several manufacturers including Elmjet and Scitex see also U.S. Pat. No. 3 373 437 by Sweet et al .

Piezoelectric ink jet printers are also one form of commonly utilized ink jet printing device. Piezoelectric systems are disclosed by Kyser et. al. in U.S. Pat. No. 3 946 398 1970 which utilizes a diaphragm mode of operation by Zolten in U.S. Pat. No. 3 683 212 1970 which discloses a squeeze mode of operation of a piezoelectric crystal Stemme in U.S. Pat. No. 3 747 120 1972 discloses a bend mode of piezoelectric operation Howkins in U.S. Pat. No. 4 459 601 discloses a piezoelectric push mode actuation of the ink jet stream and Fischbeck in U.S. Pat. No. 4 584 590 which discloses a shear mode type of piezoelectric transducer element.

Recently thermal ink jet printing has become an extremely popular form of ink jet printing. The ink jet printing techniques include those disclosed by Endo et al in GB 2007162 1979 and Vaught et al in U.S. Pat. No. 4 490 728. Both the aforementioned references disclose ink jet printing techniques which rely upon the activation of an electrothermal actuator which results in the creation of a bubble in a constricted space such as a nozzle which thereby causes the ejection of ink from an aperture connected to the confined space onto a relevant print media. Printing devices utilizing the electro thermal actuator are manufactured by manufacturers such as Canon and Hewlett Packard.

As can be seen from the foregoing many different types of printing technologies are available. Ideally a printing technology should have a number of desirable attributes. These include inexpensive construction and operation high speed operation safe and continuous long term operation etc. Each technology may have its own advantages and disadvantages in the areas of cost speed quality reliability power usage simplicity of construction operation durability and consumables.

It would be desirable to create a more compact and efficient inkjet printer having an efficient and effective operation in addition to being as compact as possible.

The ink jet designs shown here are suitable for a wide range of digital printing systems from battery powered one time use digital cameras through to desktop and network printers and through to commercial printing systems

For ease of manufacture using standard process equipment the print head is designed to be a monolithic 0.5 micron CMOS chip with MEMS post processing. For a general introduction to micro electric mechanical systems MEMS reference is made to standard proceedings in this field including the proceedings of the SPIE International Society for Optical Engineering volumes and which contain the proceedings for recent advances and conferences in this field.

For color photographic applications the print head is 100 mm long with a width which depends upon the ink jet type. The smallest print head designed is IJ38 which is 0.35 mm wide giving a chip area of 35 square mm. The print heads each contain 19 200 nozzles plus data and control circuitry.

Eleven important characteristics of the fundamental operation of individual ink jet nozzles have been identified. These characteristics are largely orthogonal and so can be elucidated as an eleven dimensional matrix. Most of the eleven axes of this matrix include entries developed by the present assignee.

The complete eleven dimensional table represented by these axes contains 36.9 billion possible configurations of ink jet nozzle. While not all of the possible combinations result in a viable ink jet technology many million configurations are viable. It is clearly impractical to elucidate all of the possible configurations. Instead certain ink jet types have been investigated in detail. These are designated IJ01 to IJ45.

Other ink jet configurations can readily be derived from these 45 examples by substituting alternative configurations along one or more of the 11 axes. Most of the IJ01 to IJ45 examples can be made into ink jet print heads with characteristics superior to any currently available ink jet technology.

Where there are prior art examples known to the inventor one or more of these examples are listed in the examples column of the tables below. The IJ01 to IJ45 series are also listed in the examples column. In some cases a printer may be listed more than once in a table where it shares characteristics with more than one entry.

Suitable applications for the ink jet technologies include Home printers Office network printers Short run digital printers Commercial print systems Fabric printers Pocket printers Internet WWW printers Video printers Medical imaging Wide format printers Notebook PC printers Fax machines Industrial printing systems Photocopiers Photographic minilabs etc.

The information associated with the aforementioned 11 dimensional matrix are set out in the following tables.

In there is illustrated an exploded perspective view illustrating the construction of a single ink jet nozzle in accordance with the principles of the present invention.

The nozzle operates on the principle of electromechanical energy conversion and comprises a solenoid which is connected electrically at a first end to a magnetic plate which is in turn connected to a current source e.g. utilized to activate the ink nozzle . The magnetic plate can be constructed from electrically conductive iron.

A second magnetic plunger is also provided again being constructed from soft magnetic iron. Upon energising the solenoid the plunger is attracted to the fixed magnetic plate . The plunger thereby pushes against the ink within the nozzle creating a high pressure zone in the nozzle chamber . This causes a movement of the ink in the nozzle chamber and in a first design subsequent ejection of an ink drop. A series of apertures e.g. is provided so that ink in the region of solenoid is squirted out of the holes in the top of the plunger as it moves towards lower plate . This prevents ink trapped in the area of solenoid from increasing the pressure on the plunger and thereby increasing the magnetic forces needed to move the plunger .

Referring now to there is illustrated a timing diagram of the plunger current control signal. Initially a solenoid current pulse is activated for the movement of the plunger and ejection of a drop from the ink nozzle. After approximately 2 micro seconds the current to the solenoid is turned off. At the same time or at a slightly later time a reverse current pulse is applied having approximately half the magnitude of the forward current. As the plunger has a residual magnetism the reverse current pulse causes the plunger to move backwards towards its original position. A series of torsional springs also assists in the return of the plunger to its original position. The reverse current pulse is turned off before the magnetism of the plunger is reversed which would otherwise result in the plunger being attracted to the fixed plate again. Returning to the forced return of the plunger to its quiescent position results in a low pressure in the chamber . This can cause ink to begin flowing from the outlet nozzle inwards and also ingests air to the chamber . The forward velocity of the drop and the backward velocity of the ink in the chamber are resolved by the ink drop breaking off around the nozzle . The ink drop then continues to travel toward the recording medium under its own momentum. The nozzle refills due to the surface tension of the ink at the nozzle tip . Shortly after the time of drop break off a meniscus at the nozzle tip is formed with an approximately concave hemispherical surface. The surface tension will exert a net forward force on the ink which will result in nozzle refilling. The repetition rate of the nozzle is therefore principally determined by the nozzle refill time which will be 100 microseconds depending on the device geometry ink surface tension and the volume of the ejected drop.

Turning now to an important aspect of the operation of the electro magnetically driven print nozzle will now be described. Upon a current flowing through the coil the plate becomes strongly attracted to the plate . The plate experiences a downward force and begins movement towards the plate . This movement imparts a momentum to the ink within the nozzle chamber . The ink is subsequently ejected as hereinbefore described. Unfortunately the movement of the plate causes a build up of pressure in the area between the plate and the coil . This build up would normally result in a reduced effectiveness of the plate in ejecting ink.

However in a first design the plate preferably includes a series of apertures e.g. which allow for the flow of ink from the area back into the ink chamber and thereby allow a reduction in the pressure in area . This results in an increased effectiveness in the operation of the plate .

Preferably the apertures are of a teardrop shape increasing in width with increasing radial distance from a centre of the plunger. The aperture profile thereby provides minimal disturbance of the magnetic flux through the plunger while maintaining structural integrity of plunger .

After the plunger has reached its end position the current through coil is reversed resulting in a repulsion of the two plates . Additionally the torsional spring e.g. acts to return the plate to its initial position.

The use of a torsional spring e.g. has a number of substantial benefits including a compact layout. The construction of the torsional spring from the same material and same processing steps as that of the plate simplifies the manufacturing process.

In an alternative design the top surface of plate does not include a series of apertures. Rather the inner radial surface see of plate comprises slots of substantially constant cross sectional profile in fluid communication between the nozzle chamber and the area between plate and the solenoid . Upon activation of the coil the plate is attracted to the armature plate and experiences a force directed towards plate . As a result of the movement fluid in the area is compressed and experiences a higher pressure than its surrounds. As a result the flow of fluid takes place out of the slots in the inner radial surface plate into the nozzle chamber . The flow of fluid into chamber in addition to the movement of the plate causes the ejection of ink out of the ink nozzle port . Again the movement of the plate causes the torsional springs for example to be resiliently deformed. Upon completion of the movement of the plate the coil is deactivated and a slight reverse current is applied. The reverse current acts to repel the plate from the armature plate . The torsional springs for example act as additional means to return the plate to its initial or quiescent position.

Returning now to the nozzle apparatus is constructed from the following main parts including a nozzle surface having an aperture which can be constructed from boron doped silicon . The radius of the aperture of the nozzle is an important determinant of drop velocity and drop size.

Next a CMOS silicon layer is provided upon which is fabricated all the data storage and driving circuitry necessary for the operation of the nozzle . In this layer a nozzle chamber is also constructed. The nozzle chamber should be wide enough so that viscous drag from the chamber walls does not significantly increase the force required of the plunger. It should also be deep enough so that any air ingested through the nozzle port when the plunger returns to its quiescent state does not extend to the plunger device. If it does the ingested bubble may form a cylindrical surface instead of a hemispherical surface resulting in the nozzle not refilling properly. A CMOS dielectric and insulating layer containing various current paths for the current connection to the plunger device is also provided.

Next a fixed plate of ferroelectric material is provided having two parts . The two parts are electrically insulated from one another.

Next a solenoid is provided. This can comprise a spiral coil of deposited copper. Preferably a single spiral layer is utilized to avoid fabrication difficulty and copper is used for a low resistivity and high electro migration resistance.

Next a plunger of ferromagnetic material is provided to maximise the magnetic force generated. The plunger and fixed magnetic plate surround the solenoid as a torus. Thus little magnetic flux is lost and the flux is concentrated around the gap between the plunger and the fixed plate .

The gap between the fixed plate and the plunger is one of the most important parts of the print nozzle . The size of the gap will strongly affect the magnetic force generated and also limits the travel of the plunger . A small gap is desirable to achieve a strong magnetic force but a large gap is desirable to allow longer plunger travel and therefore allow a smaller plunger radius to be utilised.

Next the springs e.g. for returning to the plunger to its quiescent position after a drop has been ejected are provided. The springs e.g. can be fabricated from the same material and in the same processing steps as the plunger . Preferably the springs e.g. act as torsional springs in their interaction with the plunger .

Finally all surfaces are coated with passivation layers which may be silicon nitride SiN diamond like carbon DLC or other chemically inert highly impermeable layer. The passivation layers are especially important for device lifetime as the active device will be immersed in the ink.

29. Detach the chips from the glass blank. Strip all adhesive resist sacrificial and exposed seed layers. This step is shown in .

30. Mount the printheads in their packaging which may be a molded plastic former incorporating ink channels which supply different colors of ink to the appropriate regions of the front surface of the wafer.

In a preferred embodiment an ink jet print head is made up of a plurality of nozzle chambers each having an ink ejection port. Ink is ejected from the ink ejection port through the utilization of attraction between two parallel plates.

Turning initially to there is illustrated a cross sectional view of a single nozzle arrangement as constructed in accordance with a preferred embodiment. The nozzle arrangement includes a nozzle chamber in which is stored ink to be ejected out of an ink ejection port . The nozzle arrangement can be constructed on the top of a silicon wafer utilizing micro electro mechanical systems construction techniques as will become more apparent hereinafter. The top of the nozzle plate also includes a series of regular spaced etchant holes e.g. which are provided for efficient sacrificial etching of lower layers of the nozzle arrangement during construction. The size of the etchant holes is small enough that surface tension characteristics inhibit ejection from the holes during operation.

Turning now to there is illustrated a cross sectional view of one side of the nozzle arrangement . A nozzle arrangement is constructed on a silicon wafer base on top of which is first constructed a standard CMOS two level metal layer which includes the required drive and control circuitry for each nozzle arrangement. The layer which includes two levels of aluminum includes one level of aluminum being utilized as a bottom electrode plate. Other portions of this layer can comprise nitride passivation. On top of the layer there is provided a thin polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE layer .

Next an air gap is provided between the top and bottom layers. This is followed by a further PTFE layer which forms part of the top plate . The two PTFE layers are provided so as to reduce possible stiction effects between the upper and lower plates. Next a top aluminum electrode layer is provided followed by a nitride layer not shown which provides structural integrity to the top electro plate. The layers are fabricated so as to include a corrugated portion which concertinas upon movement of the top plate .

By placing a potential difference across the two aluminum layers and the top plate is attracted to bottom aluminum layer thereby resulting in a movement of the top plate towards the bottom plate . This results in energy being stored in the concertinaed spring arrangement in addition to air passing out of the side air holes e.g. and the ink being sucked into the nozzle chamber as a result of the distortion of the meniscus over the ink ejection port . Subsequently the potential across the plates is eliminated thereby causing the concertinaed spring portion to rapidly return the plate to its rest position. The rapid movement of the plate causes the consequential ejection of ink from the nozzle chamber via the ink ejection port . Additionally air flows in via air gap underneath the plate .

The ink jet nozzles of a preferred embodiment can be formed from utilization of semi conductor fabrication and MEMS techniques. Turning to there is illustrated an exploded perspective view of the various layers in the final construction of a nozzle arrangement . At the lowest layer is the silicon wafer upon which all other processing steps take place. On top of the silicon layer is the CMOS circuitry layer which primarily comprises glass. On top of this layer is a nitride passivation layer which is primarily utilized to passivate and protect the lower glass layer from any sacrificial process that may be utilized in the building up of subsequent layers. Next there is provided the aluminum layer which in the alternative can form part of the lower CMOS glass layer . This layer forms the bottom plate. Next two PTFE layers are provided between which is laid down a sacrificial layer such as glass which is subsequently etched away so as to release the plate . On top of the PTFE layer is laid down the aluminum layer and a subsequent thicker nitride layer not shown which provides structural support to the top electrode stopping it from sagging or deforming. After this comes the top nitride nozzle chamber layer which forms the rest of the nozzle chamber and ink supply channel. The layer can be formed from the depositing and etching of a sacrificial layer and then depositing the nitride layer etching the nozzle and etchant holes utilizing an appropriate mask before etching away the sacrificial material.

Obviously print heads can be formed from large arrays of nozzle arrangements on a single wafer which is subsequently diced into separate print heads. Ink supply can be either from the side of the wafer or through the wafer utilizing deep anisotropic etching systems such as high density low pressure plasma etching systems available from surface technology systems. Further the corrugated portion can be formed through the utilisation of a half tone mask process.

One form of detailed manufacturing process which can be used to fabricate monolithic ink jet print heads operating in accordance with the principles taught by the present embodiment can proceed utilizing the following steps 

1. Using a double sided polished wafer complete a 0.5 micron one poly 2 metal CMOS process . This step is shown in . For clarity these diagrams may not be to scale and may not represent a cross section though any single plane of the nozzle. is a key to representations of various materials in these manufacturing diagrams and those of other cross referenced ink jet configurations.

2. Etch the passivation layers to expose the bottom electrode formed of second level metal. This etch is performed using Mask 1. This step is shown in .

6. Expose and develop the photosensitive polyimide using Mask 2. This mask is a gray scale mask which defines the concertina edge of the upper electrode. The result of the etch is a series of triangular ridges at the circumference of the electrode. This concertina edge is used to convert tensile stress into bend strain and thereby allow the upper electrode to move when a voltage is applied across the electrodes. This step is shown in .

7. Etch the polyimide and passivation layers using Mask 3 which exposes the contacts for the upper electrode which are formed in second level metal.

9. Deposit 0.5 microns of silicon nitride SiN which forms the movable membrane of the upper electrode.

10. Etch the nitride and tantalum using Mask 4. This mask defines the upper electrode as well as the contacts to the upper electrode. This step is shown in .

12. Expose and develop the photosensitive polyimide using Mask 5. A proximity aligner can be used to obtain a large depth of focus as the line width for this step is greater than 2 microns and can be 5 microns or more. This mask defines the nozzle chamber walls. This step is shown in .

14. Etch to a depth of 1 micron using Mask 6. This mask defines the nozzle rim . This step is shown in .

15. Etch down to the sacrificial layer using Mask 7. This mask defines the roof of the nozzle chamber and the nozzle itself. This step is shown in .

16. Back etch completely through the silicon wafer with for example an ASE Advanced Silicon Etcher from Surface Technology Systems using Mask 8. This mask defines the ink inlets which are etched through the wafer . The wafer is also diced by this etch.

18. Etch the sacrificial polyimide . The nozzle chambers are cleared a gap is formed between the electrodes and the chips are separated by this etch. To avoid stiction a final rinse using supercooled carbon dioxide can be used. This step is shown in .

19. Mount the print heads in their packaging which may be a molded plastic former incorporating ink channels which supply the appropriate color ink to the ink inlets at the back of the wafer.

20. Connect the print heads to their interconnect systems. For a low profile connection with minimum disruption of airflow TAB may be used. Wire bonding may also be used if the printer is to be operated with sufficient clearance to the paper.

In a preferred embodiment there is provided an ink jet printer having nozzle chambers. Each nozzle chamber includes a thermoelastic bend actuator that utilizes a planar resistive material in the construction of the bend actuator. The bend actuator is activated when it is required to eject ink from a chamber.

Turning now to there is illustrated a cross sectional view partly in section of a nozzle arrangement as constructed in accordance with a preferred embodiment. The nozzle arrangement can be formed as part of an array of nozzles fabricated on a semi conductor wafer utilizing techniques known in the production of micro electro mechanical systems MEMS . The nozzle arrangement includes a boron doped silicon wafer layer which can be constructed by a back etching a silicon wafer which has a buried boron doped epitaxial layer. The boron doped layer can be further etched so as to define a nozzle hole and rim .

The nozzle arrangement includes a nozzle chamber which can be constructed by utilization of an anisotropic crystallographic etch of the silicon portions of the wafer.

On top of the silicon portions is included a glass layer which can comprise CMOS drive circuitry including a two level metal layer not shown so as to provide control and drive circuitry for the thermal actuator. On top of the CMOS glass layer is provided a nitride layer which includes side portions which act to passivate lower layers from etching that is utilized in construction of the nozzle arrangement . The nozzle arrangement includes a paddle actuator which is constructed on a nitride base which acts to form a rigid paddle for the overall actuator . Next an aluminum layer is provided with the aluminum layer being interconnected by vias with the lower CMOS circuitry so as to form a first portion of a circuit. The aluminum layer is interconnected at a point to an Indium Tin Oxide ITO layer which provides for resistive heating on demand. The ITO layer includes a number of etch holes for allowing the etching away of a lower level sacrificial layer which is formed between the layers . The ITO layer is further connected to the lower glass CMOS circuitry layer by via . On top of the ITO layer is optionally provided a polytetrafluoroethylene layer not shown which provides for insulation and further rapid expansion of the top layer upon heating as a result of passing a current through the bottom layer and ITO layer .

The back surface of the nozzle arrangement is placed in an ink reservoir so as to allow ink to flow into nozzle chamber . When it is desired to eject a drop of ink a current is passed through the aluminum layer and ITO layer . The aluminum layer provides a very low resistance path to the current whereas the ITO layer provides a high resistance path to the current. Each of the layers are passivated by means of coating by a thin nitride layer not shown so as to insulate and passivate the layers from the surrounding ink. Upon heating of the ITO layer and optionally PTFE layer the top of the actuator expands more rapidly than the bottom portions of the actuator . This results in a rapid bending of the actuator particularly around the point due to the utilization of the rigid nitride paddle arrangement . This accentuates the downward movement of the actuator which results in the ejection of ink from ink ejection nozzle .

Between the two layers is provided a gap which can be constructed via utilization of etching of sacrificial layers so as to dissolve away sacrificial material between the two layers. Hence in operation ink is allowed to enter this area and thereby provides a further cooling of the lower surface of the actuator so as to assist in accentuating the bending. Upon de activation of the actuator it returns to its quiescent position above the nozzle chamber . The nozzle chamber refills due to the surface tension of the ink through the gaps between the actuator and the nozzle chamber .

The PTFE layer has a high coefficient of thermal expansion and therefore further assists in accentuating any bending of the actuator . Therefore in order to eject ink from the nozzle chamber a current is passed through the planar layers resulting in resistive heating of the top layer which further results in a general bending down of the actuator resulting in the ejection of ink.

The nozzle arrangement is mounted on a second silicon chip wafer which defines an ink reservoir channel to the back of the nozzle arrangement for resupply of ink.

Turning now to there is illustrated an exploded perspective view illustrating the various layers of a nozzle arrangement . The arrangement can as noted previously be constructed from back etching to the boron doped layer. The actuator can further be constructed through the utilization of a sacrificial layer filling the nozzle chamber and the depositing of the various layers and optional PTFE layer before sacrificially etching the nozzle chamber in addition to the sacrificial material in area See . To this end the nitride layer includes side portions which act to passivate the portions of the lower glass layer which would otherwise be attacked as a result of sacrificial etching.

One form of detailed manufacturing process which can be used to fabricate monolithic ink jet print heads operating in accordance with the principles taught by the present embodiment can proceed utilizing the following steps 

1. Using a double sided polished wafer deposit 3 microns of epitaxial silicon heavily doped with boron .

2. Deposit 10 microns of epitaxial silicon either p type or n type depending upon the CMOS process used.

4. Etch the CMOS oxide layers down to silicon or second level metal using Mask 1. This mask defines the nozzle cavity and the bend actuator electrode contact vias . This step is shown in .

5. Crystallographically etch the exposed silicon using KOH as shown at . This etch stops on crystallographic planes and on the boron doped silicon buried layer . This step is shown in .

6. Deposit 0.5 microns of low stress PECVD silicon nitride SiN . The nitride acts as an ion diffusion barrier. This step is shown in .

7. Deposit a thick sacrificial layer e.g. low stress glass filling the nozzle cavity. Planarize the sacrificial layer down to the nitride surface. This step is shown in .

9. Etch the tantalum using Mask 2. This step is shown in . This mask defines the space around the stiffener section of the bend actuator and the electrode contact vias.

10. Etch nitride still using Mask 2. This clears the nitride from the electrode contact vias . This step is shown in .

11. Deposit one micron of gold patterned using Mask 3. This may be deposited in a lift off process. Gold is used for its corrosion resistance and low Young s modulus. This mask defines the lower conductor of the bend actuator. This step is shown in .

12. Deposit 1 micron of thermal blanket . This material should be a non conductive material with a very low Young s modulus and a low thermal conductivity such as an elastomer or foamed polymer.

13. Pattern the thermal blanket using Mask 4. This mask defines the contacts between the upper and lower conductors and the upper conductor and the drive circuitry. This step is shown in .

14. Deposit 1 micron of a material with a very high resistivity but still conductive a high Young s modulus a low heat capacity and a high coefficient of thermal expansion. A material such as indium tin oxide ITO may be used depending upon the dimensions of the bend actuator.

15. Pattern the ITO using Mask 5. This mask defines the upper conductor of the bend actuator. This step is shown in .

17. Pattern the thermal blanket using Mask 6. This mask defines the bend actuator and allows ink to flow around the actuator into the nozzle cavity. This step is shown in .

18. Mount the wafer on a glass blank and back etch the wafer using KOH with no mask. This etch thins the wafer and stops at the buried boron doped silicon layer . This step is shown in .

In a preferred embodiment a stacked capacitive actuator is provided which has alternative electrode layers sandwiched between a compressible polymer. Hence on activation of the stacked capacitor the plates are drawn together compressing the polymer thereby storing energy in the compressed polymer. The capacitor is then de activated or drained with the result that the compressed polymer acts to return the actuator to its original position and thereby causes the ejection of ink from an ink ejection port.

Turning now to there is illustrated a single nozzle arrangement as constructed in accordance with a preferred embodiment. The nozzle arrangement includes an ink ejection portal for the ejection of ink on demand. The ink is ejected from a nozzle chamber by means of a stacked capacitor type device . In a first design the stacked capacitor device consists of capacitive plates sandwiched between a compressible polymer. Upon charging of the capacitive plates the polymer is compressed thereby resulting in a general accordion or concertinaing of the actuator so that its top surface moves away from the ink ejection portal . The compression of the polymer sandwich stores energy in the compressed polymer. The capacitors are subsequently rapidly discharged resulting in the energy in the compressed polymer being released upon the polymer s return to quiescent position. The return of the actuator to its quiescent position results in the ejection of ink from the nozzle chamber . The process is illustrated schematically in with illustrating the nozzle chamber in its quiescent or idle state having an ink meniscus around the nozzle ejection portal . Subsequently the electrostatic actuator is activated resulting in its contraction as indicated in . The contraction results in the meniscus changing shape as indicated with the resulting surface tension effects resulting in the drawing in of ink around the meniscus and consequently ink flows into nozzle chamber .

After sufficient time the meniscus returns to its quiescent position with the capacitor being loaded ready for firing . The capacitor plates are then rapidly discharged resulting as illustrated in in the rapid return of the actuator to its original position. The rapid return imparts a momentum to the ink within the nozzle chamber so as to cause the expansion of the ink meniscus and the subsequent ejection of ink from the nozzle chamber .

Turning now to there is illustrated a perspective view of a portion of the actuator exploded in part. The actuator consists of a series of interleaved plates between which is sandwiched a compressive material for example styrene ethylene butylene styrene block copolymer. One group of electrodes e.g. jut out at one side of the stacked capacitor layout. A second series of electrodes e.g. jut out a second side of the capacitive actuator. The electrodes are connected at one side to a first conductive material and the other series of electrodes e.g. are connected to second conductive material . The two conductive materials are electrically isolated from one another and are in turn interconnected to lower signal and drive layers as will become more readily apparent hereinafter.

In alternative designs the stacked capacitor device consists of other thin film materials in place of the styrene ethylene butylene styrene block copolymer. Such materials may include 

3 Materials that can be electrically switched between a ferro electric and an anti ferro electric phase such as PLZSnT.

Importantly the electrode actuator can be rapidly constructed utilizing chemical vapor deposition CVD techniques. The various layers can be laid down on a planar wafer one after another covering the whole surface of the wafer. A stack can be built up rapidly utilizing CVD techniques. The two sets of electrodes are preferably deposited utilizing separate metals. For example aluminum and tantalum could be utilized as materials for the metal layers. The utilization of different metal layers allows for selective etching utilizing a mask layer so as to form the structure as indicated in . For example the CVD sandwich can be first laid down and then a series of selective etchings utilizing appropriate masks can be utilized to produce the overall stacked capacitor structure. The utilization of the CVD process substantially enhances the efficiency of production of the stacked capacitor devices.

Turning now to there is shown an exploded perspective view illustrating the construction of a single ink jet nozzle in accordance with a preferred embodiment. The ink jet nozzle arrangement is constructed on a standard silicon wafer on top of which is constructed data drive circuitry which can be constructed in the usual manner such as a two level metal CMOS layer . On top of the CMOS layer is constructed a nitride passivation layer which provides passivation protection for the lower layers during operation and also should an etchant be utilized which would normally dissolve the lower layers. The various layers of the stacked device for example can be laid down utilizing CVD techniques. The stacked device is constructed utilizing the aforementioned production steps including utilizing appropriate masks for selective etchings to produce the overall stacked capacitor structure. Further interconnection can be provided between the electrodes and the circuitry in the CMOS layer . Finally a nitride layer is provided so as to form the walls of the nozzle chamber e.g. and posts e.g. in one open wall of the nozzle chamber. The surface layer of the layer can be deposited onto a sacrificial material. The sacrificial material is subsequently etched so as to form the nozzle chamber . To this end the top layer includes etchant holes e.g. so as to speed up the etching process in addition to the ink ejection portal . The diameter of the etchant holes e.g. is significantly smaller than that of the ink ejection portal . If required an additional nitride layer may be provided on top of the layer to protect the stacked device during the etching of the sacrificial material to form the nozzle chamber and during operation of the ink jet nozzle.

A preferred embodiment of the present invention relies upon a magnetic actuator to load a spring such that upon deactivation of the magnetic actuator the resultant movement of the spring causes ejection of a drop of ink as the spring returns to its original position.

Turning to there is illustrated an exploded perspective view of an ink nozzle arrangement constructed in accordance with a preferred embodiment. It would be understood that a preferred embodiment can be constructed as an array of nozzle arrangements so as to together form a line for printing.

The operation of the ink nozzle arrangement of proceeds by a solenoid being energized by way of a driving circuit when it is desired to print out a ink drop. The energized solenoid induces a magnetic field in a fixed soft magnetic pole and a moveable soft magnetic pole . The solenoid power is turned on to a maximum current for long enough to move the moveable pole from its rest position to a stopped position close to the fixed magnetic pole . The ink nozzle arrangement of sits within an ink chamber filled with ink. Therefore holes are provided in the moveable soft magnetic pole for squirting out of ink from around the coil when the pole undergoes movement.

The moveable soft magnetic pole is balanced by a fulcrum with a piston head . Movement of the magnetic pole closer to the stationary pole causes the piston head to move away from a nozzle chamber drawing air into the chamber via an ink ejection port . The piston is then held open above the nozzle chamber by means of maintaining a low keeper current through solenoid . The keeper level current through solenoid being sufficient to maintain the moveable pole against the fixed soft magnetic pole . The level of current will be substantially less than the maximum current level because the gap between the two poles and is at a minimum. For example a keeper level current of 10 of the maximum current level may be suitable. During this phase of operation the meniscus of ink at the nozzle tip or ink ejection port is a concave hemisphere due to the in flow of air. The surface tension on the meniscus exerts a net force on the ink which results in ink flow from the ink chamber into the nozzle chamber . This results in the nozzle chamber refilling replacing the volume taken up by the piston head which has been withdrawn. This process takes approximately 100 microseconds.

The current within solenoid is then reversed to half that of the maximum current. The reversal demagnetises the magnetic poles and initiates a return of the piston to its rest position. The piston is moved to its normal rest position by both the magnetic repulsion and by the energy stored in a stressed tortional spring which was put in a state of torsion upon the movement of moveable pole .

The forces applied to the piston as a result of the reverse current and spring will be greatest at the beginning of the movement of the piston and will decrease as the spring elastic stress falls to zero. As a result the acceleration of piston is high at the beginning of a reverse stroke and the resultant ink velocity within the chamber becomes uniform during the stroke. This results in an increased operating tolerance before ink flow over the printhead surface will occur.

At a predetermined time during the return stroke the solenoid reverse current is turned off. The current is turned off when the residual magnetism of the movable pole is at a minimum. The piston continues to move towards its original rest position.

The piston will overshoot the quiescent or rest position due to its inertia. Overshoot in the piston movement achieves two things greater ejected drop volume and velocity and improved drop break off as the piston returns from overshoot to its quiescent position.

The piston will eventually return from overshoot to the quiescent position. This return is caused by the springs which are now stressed in the opposite direction. The piston return sucks some of the ink back into the nozzle chamber causing the ink ligament connecting the ink drop to the ink in the nozzle chamber to thin. The forward velocity of the drop and the backward velocity of the ink in the nozzle chamber are resolved by the ink drop breaking off from the ink in the nozzle chamber .

A liquid ink printhead has one ink nozzle arrangement associated with each of the multitude of nozzles. The arrangement has the following major parts 

 2 An ejection port . The radius of the ejection port is an important determinant of drop velocity and drop size.

 3 A piston . This is a cylinder which moves through the nozzle chamber to expel the ink. The piston is connected to one end of the lever arm . The piston radius is approximately 1.5 to 2 times the radius of the ejection port . The ink drop volume output is mostly determined by the volume of ink displaced by the piston during the piston return stroke.

 4 A nozzle chamber . The nozzle chamber is slightly wider than the piston . The gap between the piston and the nozzle chamber walls is as small as is required to ensure that the piston does not contact the nozzle chamber during actuation or return. If the printheads are fabricated using 0.5 micron semiconductor lithography then a 1 micron gap will usually be sufficient. The nozzle chamber is also deep enough so that air ingested through the ejection port when the plunger returns to its quiescent state does not extend to the piston . If it does the ingested bubble may form a cylindrical surface instead of a hemispherical surface. If this happens the nozzle will not refill properly.

 5 A solenoid . This is a spiral coil of copper. Copper is used for its low resistivity and high electro migration resistance.

 7 A moveable magnetic pole of ferromagnetic material . To maximise the magnetic force generated the moveable magnetic pole and fixed magnetic pole surround the solenoid as a torus. Thus little magnetic flux is lost and the flux is concentrated across the gap between the moveable magnetic pole and the fixed pole . The moveable magnetic pole has holes in the surface above the solenoid to allow trapped ink to escape. These holes are arranged and shaped so as to minimise their effect on the magnetic force generated between the moveable magnetic pole and the fixed magnetic pole .

 8 A magnetic gap. The gap between the fixed plate and the moveable magnetic pole is one of the most important parts of the print actuator. The size of the gap strongly affects the magnetic force generated and also limits the travel of the moveable magnetic pole . A small gap is desirable to achieve a strong magnetic force. The travel of the piston is related to the travel of the moveable magnetic pole and therefore the gap by the lever arm .

 9 Length of the lever arm . The lever arm allows the travel of the piston and the moveable magnetic pole to be independently optimised. At the short end of the lever arm is the moveable magnetic pole . At the long end of the lever arm is the piston . The spring is at the fulcrum . The optimum travel for the moveable magnetic pole is less than 1 micron so as to minimise the magnetic gap. The optimum travel for the piston is approximately 5 micron for a 1200 dpi printer. The difference in optimum travel is resolved by a lever with a 5 1 or greater ratio in arm length.

 10 Springs . The springs e.g. return the piston to its quiescent position after a deactivation of the actuator. The springs are at the fulcrum of the lever arm.

 11 Passivation layers not shown . All surfaces are preferably coated with passivation layers which may be silicon nitride SiN diamond like carbon DLC or other chemically inert highly impermeable layer. The passivation layers are especially important for device lifetime as the active device is immersed in the ink. As will be evident from the foregoing description there is an advantage in ejecting the drop on deactivation of the solenoid . This advantage comes from the rate of acceleration of the moving magnetic pole which is used as a piston or plunger.

The force produced by a moveable magnetic pole by an electromagnetic induced field is approximately proportional to the inverse square of the gap between the moveable and static magnetic poles . When the solenoid is off this gap is at a maximum. When the solenoid is turned on the moving pole is attracted to the static pole . As the gap decreases the force increases accelerating the movable pole faster. The velocity increases in a highly non linear fashion approximately with the square of time. During the reverse movement of the moving pole upon deactivation the acceleration of the moving pole is greatest at the beginning and then slows as the spring elastic stress falls to zero. As a result the velocity of the moving pole is more uniform during the reverse stroke movement.

 1 The velocity of piston or plunger is much more constant over the duration of the drop ejection stroke.

 2 The piston or plunger can readily be entirely removed from the ink chamber during the ink fill stage and thereby the nozzle filling time can be reduced allowing faster printhead operation.

 1 The stresses on the spring are relatively large. Careful design is required to ensure that the springs operate at below the yield strength of the materials used.

 2 The solenoid must be provided with a keeper current for the nozzle fill duration. The keeper current will typically be less than 10 of the solenoid actuation current.

However the nozzle fill duration is typically around 50 times the drop firing duration so the keeper energy will typically exceed the solenoid actuation energy.

The printhead is fabricated from two silicon wafers. A first wafer is used to fabricate the print nozzles the printhead wafer and a second wafer the Ink Channel Wafer is utilized to fabricate the various ink channels in addition to providing a support means for the first channel. The fabrication process then proceeds as follows 

 1 Start with a single crystal silicon wafer which has a buried epitaxial layer of silicon which is heavily doped with boron. The boron should be doped to preferably 10atoms per cmof boron or more and be approximately 3 micron thick and be doped in a manner suitable for the active semiconductor device technology chosen. The wafer diameter of the printhead wafer should be the same as the ink channel wafer.

 2 Fabricate the drive transistors and data distribution circuitry according to the process chosen eg. CMOS .

 5 Using a dual damascene process etch two levels into the top oxide layer. Level 1 is 4 micron deep and level is 5 micron deep. Level 2 contacts the second level metal. The masks for the static magnetic pole are used.

 9 Etch the SiNfor via holes for the connections to the solenoids and for the nozzle chamber region .

 12 Deposit a thin diffusion barrier such as Ti TiN or TiW and an adhesion layer if the diffusion layer chosen has insufficient adhesion.

The deposition may be by sputtering CVD or electroless plating. As well as lower resistivity than aluminium copper has significantly higher resistance to electro migration. The electro migration resistance is significant as current densities in the order of 3 10Amps cmmay be required. Copper films deposited by low energy kinetic ion bias sputtering have been found to have 1 000 to 100 000 times larger electro migration lifetimes larger than aluminum silicon alloy. The deposited copper should be alloyed and layered for maximum electro migration lifetimes than aluminum silicon alloy. The deposited copper should be alloyed and layered for maximum electro migration resistance while maintaining high electrical conductivity.

 14 Planarise the wafer using CMP until the level of the SiOis reached. A damascene process is used for the copper layer due to the difficulty involved in etching copper. However since the damascene dielectric layer is subsequently removed processing is actually simpler if a standard deposit etch cycle is used instead of damascene. However it should be noted that the aspect ratio of the copper etch would be 8 1 for this design compared to only 4 1 for a damascene oxide etch. This difference occurs because the copper is 1 micron wide and 4 micron thick but has only 0.5 micron spacing. Damascene processing also reduces the lithographic difficulty as the resist is on oxide not metal.

 15 Plasma etch the nozzle chamber stopping at the boron doped epitaxial silicon layer . This etch will be through around 13 micron of SiO and 8 micron of silicon. The etch should be highly anisotropic with near vertical sidewalls. The etch stop detection can be on boron in the exhaust gasses. If this etch is selective against NiFe the masks for this step and the following step can be combined and the following step can be eliminated. This step also etches the edge of the printhead wafer down to the boron layer for later separation.

 16 Etch the SiOlayer. This need only be removed in the regions above the NiFe fixed magnetic poles so it can be removed in the previous step if an Si and SiOetch selective against NiFe is used.

 17 Conformably deposit 0.5 micron of high density SiN. This forms a corrosion barrier so should be free of pin holes and be impermeable to OH ions.

 18 Deposit a thick sacrificial layer . This layer should entirely fill the nozzle chambers and coat the entire wafer to an added thickness of 8 microns. The sacrificial layer may be SiO.

 19 Etch two depths in the sacrificial layer for a dual damascene process. The deep etch is 8 microns and the shallow etch is 3 microns. The masks defines the piston the lever arm the springs and the moveable magnetic pole .

 20 Conformably deposit 0.1 micron of high density SiN. This forms a corrosion barrier so should be free of pin holes and be impermeable to OH ions.

 26 Permanently bond the wafer onto a pre fabricated ink channel wafer. The active side of the printhead wafer faces the ink channel wafer. The ink channel wafer is attached to a backing plate as it has already been etched into separate ink channel chips.

 27 Etch the printhead wafer to entirely remove the backside silicon to the level of the boron doped epitaxial layer . This etch can be a batch wet etch in ethylenediamine pyrocatechol EDP .

 28 Mask the nozzle rim from the underside of the printhead wafer. This mask also includes the chip edges.

 31 Etch through the boron doped silicon layer thereby creating the nozzle holes. This etch should also etch fairly deeply into the sacrificial material in the nozzle chambers to reduce time required to remove the sacrificial layer.

 32 Completely etch the sacrificial material. If this material is SiOthen a HF etch can be used. The nitride coating on the various layers protects the other glass dielectric layers and other materials in the device from HF etching. Access of the HF to the sacrificial layer material is through the nozzle and simultaneously through the ink channel chip. The effective depth of the etch is 21 microns.

 33 Separate the chips from the backing plate. Each chip is now a full printhead including ink channels. The two wafers have already been etched through so the printheads do not need to be diced.

One alternative form of detailed manufacturing process which can be used to fabricate monolithic ink jet printheads operating in accordance with the principles taught by the present embodiment can proceed utilizing the following steps 

1. Using a double sided polished wafer deposit 3 microns of epitaxial silicon heavily doped with boron.

5. Plasma etch the silicon down to the boron doped buried layer using oxide from step 4 as a mask. This etch does not substantially etch the aluminum. This step is shown in .

Referring now to there is illustrated a cross sectional view of a single ink nozzle unit constructed in accordance with a preferred embodiment. The ink nozzle unit includes an ink ejection nozzle for the ejection of ink which resides in a nozzle chamber . The ink is ejected from the nozzle chamber by means of movement of paddle . The paddle operates in a magnetic field which runs along the plane of the paddle . The paddle includes at least one solenoid coil which operates under the control of nozzle activation signal. The paddle operates in accordance with the well known principal of the force experienced by a moving electric charge in a magnetic field. Hence when it is desired to activate the paddle to eject an ink drop out of ink ejection nozzle the solenoid coil is activated. As a result of the activation one end of the paddle will experience a downward force See while the other end of the paddle will experience an upward force . The downward force results in a corresponding movement of the paddle and the resultant ejection of ink.

As can be seen from the cross section of the paddle can comprise multiple layers of solenoid wires with the solenoid wires e.g. forming a complete circuit having the current flow in a counter clockwise direction around a centre of the paddle . This results in paddle experiencing a rotation about an axis through as illustrated in the centre point the rotation being assisted by means of a torsional spring e.g. which acts to return the paddle to its quiescent state after deactivation of the current paddle . Whilst a torsional spring is to be preferred it is envisaged that other forms of springs may be possible such as a leaf spring or the like.

The nozzle chamber refills due to the surface tension of the ink at the ejection nozzle after the ejection of ink.

The construction of the inkjet nozzles can proceed by way of utilisation of microelectronic fabrication techniques commonly known to those skilled in the field of semi conductor fabrication.

In accordance with one form of construction two wafers are utilized upon which the active circuitry and ink jet print nozzles are fabricated and a further wafer in which the ink channels are fabricated.

Turning now to there is illustrated an exploded perspective view of a single ink jet nozzle constructed in accordance with a preferred embodiment. Construction begins which a silicon wafer see upon which has been fabricated an epitaxial boron doped layer and an epitaxial silicon layer . The boron layer is doped to a concentration of preferably 10 cmof boron or more and is approximately 2 microns thick. The silicon epitaxial layer is constructed to be approximately 8 microns thick and is doped in a manner suitable for the active semi conductor device technology.

Next the drive transistors and distribution circuitry are constructed in accordance with the fabrication process chosen resulting in a CMOS logic and drive transistor level . A silicon nitride layer not shown is then deposited.

The paddle metal layers are constructed utilizing a damascene process which is a well known process utilizing chemical mechanical polishing techniques CMP well known for utilization as a multi level metal application. The solenoid coils in paddle can be constructed from a double layer which for a first layer is produced utilizing a single damascene process.

Next a second layer is deposited utilizing this time a dual damascene process. The copper layers include contact posts for interconnection of the electromagnetic coil to the CMOS layer through vias in the silicon nitride layer not shown . However the metal post portion also includes a via interconnecting it with the lower copper level. The damascene process is finished with a planarized glass layer. The glass layers produced during utilisation of the damascene processes utilized for the deposition of layers are shown as one layer in .

Subsequently the paddle is formed and separated from the adjacent glass layer by means of a plasma etch as the etch being down to the position of silicon layer . Further the nozzle chamber underneath the panel is removed by means of a silicon anisotropic wet etch which will edge down to the boron layer . A passivation layer is then applied. The passivation layer can comprise a conformable diamond like carbon layer or a high density SiNcoating this coating provides a protective layer for the paddle and its surrounds as the paddle must exist in the highly corrosive environment water and ink.

Next the silicon wafer can be back etched through the boron doped layer and the ejection port and an ejection port rim can also be formed utilizing etching procedures.

19. Crystallographically etch the exposed silicon using KOH. This etch stops on crystallographic planes and on the boron doped silicon buried layer. Due to the design of Mask 5 this etch undercuts the silicon providing clearance for the paddle to rotate downwards.

Turning initially to there is illustrated a perspective view in section of a single nozzle apparatus constructed in accordance with the techniques of a preferred embodiment.

Each nozzle apparatus includes a nozzle outlet port for the ejection of ink from a nozzle chamber as a result of activation of an electromagnetic piston . The electromagnetic piston is activated via a solenoid coil which is positioned about the piston . When a current passes through the solenoid coil the piston experiences a force in the direction as indicated by an arrow . As a result the piston begins moving towards the outlet port and thus imparts momentum to ink within the nozzle chamber . The piston is mounted on torsional springs so that the springs act against the movement of the piston . The torsional springs are configured so that they do not fully stop the movement of the piston .

Upon completion of an ejection cycle the current to the coil is turned off. As a result the torsional springs act to return the piston to its rest position as initially shown in . Subsequently surface tension forces cause the chamber to refill with ink and to return ready for re firing .

Current to the coil is provided via aluminum connectors not shown which interconnect the coil with a semi conductor drive transistor and logic layer .

A liquid ink jet print head has one nozzle apparatus associated with a respective one of each of a multitude of nozzle apparatus . It will be evident that each nozzle apparatus has the following major parts which are constructed using standard semi conductor and micromechanical construction techniques 

2. The nozzle outlet port . The radius of the nozzle outlet port is an important determinant of drop velocity and drop size.

3. The magnetic piston . This can be manufactured from a rare earth magnetic material such as neodymium iron boron NdFeB or samarium cobalt SaCo . The pistons are magnetised after a last high temperature step in the fabrication of the print heads to ensure that the Curie temperature is not exceeded after magnetisation. A typical print head may include many thousands of pistons all of which can be magnetised simultaneously and in the same direction.

4. The nozzle chamber . The nozzle chamber is slightly wider than the piston . The gap between the piston and the nozzle chamber can be as small as is required to ensure that the piston does not contact the nozzle chamber during actuation or return of the piston . If the print heads are fabricated using a standard 0.5 m lithography process then a 1 m gap will usually be sufficient. The nozzle chamber should also be deep enough so that air ingested through the outlet port when the piston returns to its quiescent state does not extend to the piston . If it does the ingested air bubble may form a cylindrical surface instead of a hemispherical surface. If this happens the nozzle chamber may not refill properly.

5. The solenoid coil . This is a spiral coil of copper. A double layer spiral is used to obtain a high field strength with a small device radius. Copper is used for its low resistivity and high electro migration resistance.

6. Springs . The springs return the piston to its quiescent position after a drop of ink has been ejected. The springs can be fabricated from silicon nitride.

7. Passivation layers. All surfaces are coated with passivation layers which may be silicon nitride SiN diamond like carbon DLC or other chemically inert highly impermeable layer. The passivation layers are especially important for device lifetime as the active device is immersed in the ink.

The print head is fabricated from two silicon apparatus wafers. A first wafer is used to fabricate the nozzle apparatus the print head wafer and a second wafer is utilized to fabricate the various ink channels in addition to providing a support means for the first channel the Ink Channel Wafer . is an exploded perspective view illustrating the construction of the ink jet nozzle apparatus on a print head wafer. The fabrication process proceeds as follows 

Start with a single silicon wafer which has a buried epitaxial layer of silicon which is heavily doped with boron. The boron should be doped to preferably 10atoms per cmof boron or more and be approximately 3 m thick. A lightly doped silicon epitaxial layer on top of the boron doped layer should be approximately 8 m thick and be doped in a manner suitable for the active semiconductor device technology chosen. This is the starting point for the print head wafer. The wafer diameter should be the same as that of the ink channel wafer.

Next fabricate the drive transistors and data distribution circuitry required for each nozzle according to the process chosen in a standard CMOS layer up until oxide over the first level metal. On top of the CMOS layer is deposited a silicon nitride passivation layer . Next a silicon oxide layer is deposited. The silicon oxide layer is etched utilizing a mask for a copper coil layer. Subsequently a copper layer is deposited through the mask for the copper coil. The layers also include vias not shown for the interconnection of the copper coil layer to the underlying CMOS layer . Next the nozzle chamber is etched. Subsequently a sacrificial material is deposited to fill the etched volume not shown entirely. On top of the sacrificial material a silicon nitride layer is deposited including site portions . Next the magnetic material layer is deposited utilizing the magnetic piston mask. This layer also includes posts .

A final silicon nitride layer is then deposited onto an additional sacrificial layer not shown to cover the bare portions of nitride layer to the height of the magnetic material layer utilizing a mask for the magnetic piston and the torsional springs . The torsional springs and the magnetic piston see are liberated by etching the aforementioned sacrificial material.

2. Deposit 10 microns of epitaxial silicon either p type or n type depending upon the CMOS process used.

3. Complete a 0.5 micron one poly 2 metal CMOS process . The metal layers are copper instead of aluminum due to high current densities and subsequent high temperature processing. This step is shown in .

4. Deposit 0.5 microns of low stress PECVD silicon nitride SiN . The nitride acts as a dielectric and etch stop a copper diffusion barrier and an ion diffusion barrier. As the speed of operation of the print head is low the high dielectric constant of silicon nitride is not important so the nitride layer can be thick compared to sub micron CMOS back end processes.

5. Etch the nitride layer using Mask 1. This mask defines the contact vias from the solenoid coil to the second level metal contacts as well as the nozzle chamber. This step is shown in .

7. Etch the glass down to nitride or second level metal using Mask 2. This mask defines the solenoid. This step is shown in .

9. Deposit a seed layer of copper. Copper is used for its low resistivity which results in higher efficiency and its high electromigration resistance which increases reliability at high current densities.

11. Planarize using CMP. Steps 4 to 11 represent a copper dual damascene process with a 4 1 copper aspect ratio 4 microns high 1 micron wide . This step is shown in .

13. Crystallographically etch the exposed silicon using KOH. This etch stops on crystallographic planes and on the boron doped silicon buried layer. This step is shown in .

16. Wafer probe. All electrical connections are complete at this point bond pads are accessible and the chips are not yet separated.

17. Deposit a thick sacrificial layer e.g. low stress glass filling the nozzle cavity. Planarize the sacrificial layer to a depth of 5 microns over the nitride surface. This step is shown in .

26. Plasma back etch through the boron doped layer using Mask 8. This mask defines the nozzle and the edge of the chips.

27. Plasma back etch nitride up to the glass sacrificial layer through the holes in the boron doped silicon layer. At this stage the chips are separate but are still mounted on the glass blank. This step is shown in .

30. Mount the print heads in their packaging which may be a molded plastic former incorporating ink channels which supply different colors of ink to the appropriate regions of the front surface of the wafer.

In a preferred embodiment a shutter is actuated by means of a magnetic coil the coil being used to move the shutter to thereby cause the shutter to open or close. The shutter is disposed between an ink reservoir having an oscillating ink pressure and a nozzle chamber having an ink ejection port defined therein for the ejection of ink. When the shutter is open ink is allowed to flow from the ink reservoir through to the nozzle chamber and thereby cause an ejection of ink from the ink ejection port. When the shutter is closed the nozzle chamber remains in a stable state such that no ink is ejected from the chamber.

Turning now to there is illustrated a single ink jet nozzle arrangement in a closed position. The arrangement includes a series of shutters which are located above corresponding apertures to a nozzle chamber. In the ink jet nozzle is illustrated in an open position which also illustrates the apertures providing a fluid interconnection to a nozzle chamber and an ink ejection port . The shutters e.g. as shown in are interconnected and further connected to an arm which is pivotally mounted about a pivot point about which the shutters e.g. rotate. The shutter and arm are constructed from nickel iron NiFe so as to be magnetically attracted to an electromagnetic device . The electromagnetic device comprises a NiFe core around which is constructed a copper coil . The copper coil is connected to a lower drive layer via vias . The coil is activated by sending a current through the coil which results in its magnification and corresponding attraction in the areas . The high levels of attraction are due to its close proximity to the ends of the electromagnet . This results in a general rotation of the surfaces around the pivot point which in turn results in a corresponding rotation of the shutter from a closed to an open position.

A number of coiled springs are also provided. The coiled springs store energy as a consequence of the rotation of the shutter . Hence upon deactivation of the electromagnet the coil springs act to return the shutter to its closed position. As mentioned previously the opening and closing of the shutter allows for the flow of ink to the ink nozzle chamber for a subsequent ejection. The coil is activated rotating the arm bringing the surfaces into close contact with the electromagnet . The surfaces are kept in contact with the electromagnet by means of utilisation of a keeper current which due the close proximity between the surfaces is substantially less than that required to initially move the arm .

The shutter is maintained in the plane by means of a guide which overlaps slightly with an end portion of the shutter .

Turning now to there is illustrated an exploded perspective of one form of construction of a nozzle arrangement in accordance with a preferred embodiment. The bottom level consists of a boron doped silicon layer which can be formed from constructing a buried epitaxial layer within a selected wafer and then back etching using the boron doped layer as an etch stop. Subsequently there is provided a silicon layer which includes a crystallographically etched pit forming the nozzle chamber . On top of the silicon layer there is constructed a 2 micron silicon dioxide layer which includes the nozzle chamber pit opening whose side walls are passivated by a subsequent nitride layer. On top of the silicon dioxide layer is constructed a nitride layer which provides passivation of the lower silicon dioxide layer and also provides a base on which to construct the electromagnetic portions and the shutter. The nitride layer and lower silicon dioxide layer having suitable vias for the interconnection to the ends of the electromagnetic circuit for the purposes of supplying power on demand to the electromagnetic circuit.

Next a copper layer is provided. The copper layer providing a base wiring layer for the electromagnetic array in addition to a lower portion of the pivot and a lower portion of the copper layer being used to form a part of the construction of the guide .

Next a NiFe layer is provided which is used for the formation of the internal portions of the electromagnet in addition to the pivot aperture arm and shutter in addition to a portion of the guide in addition to the various spiral springs. On top of the NiFe layer is provided a copper layer for providing the top and side windings of the coil in addition to providing the formation of the top portion of guide . Each of the layers can be conductively insulated from its surroundings where required through the use of a nitride passivation layer not shown . Further a top passivation layer can be provided to cover the various top layers which will be exposed to the ink within the ink reservoir and nozzle chamber. The various levels can be formed through the use of supporting sacrificial structures which are subsequently sacrificially etched away to leave the operable device.

35. Mount the printheads in their packaging which may be a molded plastic former incorporating ink channels which supply different colors of ink to the appropriate regions of the front surface of the wafer. The package also includes a piezoelectric actuator attached to the rear of the ink channels. The piezoelectric actuator provides the oscillating ink pressure required for the ink jet operation.

In a preferred embodiment each nozzle chamber having a nozzle ejection portal further includes two thermal actuators. The first thermal actuator is utilized for the ejection of ink from the nozzle chamber while a second thermal actuator is utilized for pumping ink into the nozzle chamber for rapid ejection of subsequent drops.

Normally ink chamber refill is a result of surface tension effects of drawing ink into a nozzle chamber. In a preferred embodiment the nozzle chamber refill is assisted by an actuator which pumps ink into the nozzle chamber so as to allow for a rapid refill of the chamber and therefore a more rapid operation of the nozzle chamber in ejecting ink drops.

Turning to which represent various schematic cross sectional views of the operation of a single nozzle chamber the operation of a preferred embodiment will now be discussed. In a single nozzle chamber is schematically illustrated in section. The nozzle arrangement includes a nozzle chamber filled with ink and a nozzle ink ejection port having an ink meniscus in a quiescent position. The nozzle chamber is interconnected to an ink reservoir for the supply of ink to the nozzle chamber. Two paddle type thermal actuators are provided for the control of the ejection of ink from nozzle port and the refilling of chamber . Both of the thermal actuators are controlled by means of passing an electrical current through a resistor so as to actuate the actuator. The structure of the thermal actuators will be discussed further herein after. The arrangement of illustrates the nozzle arrangement when it is in its quiescent or idle position.

When it is desired to eject a drop of ink via the port the actuator is activated as shown in . The activation of activator results in it bending downwards forcing the ink within the nozzle chamber out of the port thereby resulting in a rapid growth of the ink meniscus . Further ink flows into the nozzle chamber as indicated by arrow .

The main actuator is then retracted as illustrated in which results in a collapse of the ink meniscus so as to form ink drop . The ink drop eventually breaks off from the main body of ink within the nozzle chamber .

Next as illustrated in the actuator is activated so as to cause rapid refill in the area around the nozzle portal . The refill comes generally from ink flows .

Next two alternative procedures are utilized depending on whether the nozzle chamber is to be fired in a next ink ejection cycle or whether no drop is to be fired. The case where no drop is to be fired is illustrated in and basically comprises the return of actuator to its quiescent position with the nozzle port area refilling by means of surface tension effects drawing ink into the nozzle chamber .

Where it is desired to fire another drop in the next ink drop ejection cycle the actuator is activated simultaneously which is illustrated in with the return of the actuator to its quiescent position. This results in more rapid refilling of the nozzle chamber in addition to simultaneous drop ejection from the ejection nozzle .

Hence it can be seen that the arrangement as illustrated in results in a rapid refilling of the nozzle chamber and therefore the more rapid cycling of ejecting drops from the nozzle chamber . This leads to higher speed and improved operation of a preferred embodiment.

Turning now to there is a illustrated a sectional perspective view of a single nozzle arrangement of a preferred embodiment. A preferred embodiment can be constructed on a silicon wafer with a large number of nozzles being constructed at any one time. The nozzle chambers can be constructed through back etching a silicon wafer to a boron doped epitaxial layer using the boron doping as an etchant stop. The boron doped layer is then further etched utilizing the relevant masks to form the nozzle port and nozzle rim . The nozzle chamber proper is formed from a crystallographic etch of the portion of the silicon wafer . The silicon wafer can include a two level metal standard CMOS layer which includes the interconnect and drive circuitry for the actuator devices. The CMOS layer is interconnected to the actuators via appropriate vias. On top of the CMOS layer is placed a nitride layer . The nitride layer is provided to passivate the lower CMOS layer from any sacrificial etchant which is utilized to etch sacrificial material in construction of the actuators . The actuators can be constructed by filling the nozzle chamber with a sacrificial material such as sacrificial glass and depositing the actuator layers utilizing standard micro electro mechanical systems MEMS processing techniques.

On top of the nitride layer is deposited a first PTFE layer followed by a copper layer and a second PTFE layer . These layers are utilized with appropriate masks so as to form the actuators . The copper layer is formed near the top surface of the corresponding actuators and is in a serpentine shape. Upon passing a current through the copper layer the copper layer is heated. The copper layer is encased in the PTFE layers . PTFE has a much greater coefficient of thermal expansion than copper 770 10 and hence is caused to expand more rapidly than the copper layer such that upon heating the copper serpentine shaped layer expands via concertinaing at the same rate as the surrounding Teflon layers. Further the copper layer is formed near the top of each actuator and hence upon heating of the copper element the lower PTFE layer remains cooler than the upper PTFE layer . This results in a bending of the actuator so as to achieve its actuation effects. The copper layer is interconnected to the lower CMOS layer by means of vias eg . Further the PTFE layers which are normally hydrophobic undergo treatment so as to be hydrophilic. Many suitable treatments exist such as plasma damaging in an ammonia atmosphere. In addition other materials having considerable properties can be utilized.

Turning to there is illustrated an exploded perspective of the various layers of an ink jet nozzle as constructed in accordance with a single nozzle arrangement of a preferred embodiment. The layers include the lower boron layer the silicon and anisotropically etched layer CMOS glass layer nitride passivation layer copper heater layer and PTFE layers which are illustrated in one layer but formed with an upper and lower Teflon layer embedding copper layer .

One form of detailed manufacturing process which can be used to fabricate monolithic ink jet print heads operating in accordance with the principles taught by the present embodiment can proceed utilizing the following steps 

1. Using a double sided polished wafer deposit 3 microns of epitaxial silicon heavily doped with boron .

2. Deposit 10 microns of epitaxial silicon either p type or n type depending upon the CMOS process used.

3. Complete a 0.5 micron one poly 2 metal CMOS process . The metal layers are copper instead of aluminum due to high current densities and subsequent high temperature processing. This step is shown in . For clarity these diagrams may not be to scale and may not represent a cross section though any single plane of the nozzle. is a key to representations of various materials in these manufacturing diagrams and those of other cross referenced ink jet configurations.

4. Etch the CMOS oxide layers down to silicon or second level metal using Mask 1. This mask defines the nozzle cavity and the bend actuator electrode contact vias . This step is shown in .

5. Crystallographically etch the exposed silicon using KOH. This etch stops on 111 crystallographic planes and on the boron doped silicon buried layer. This step is shown in .

6. Deposit 0.5 microns of low stress PECVD silicon nitride SiN . The nitride acts as an ion diffusion barrier. This step is shown in .

7. Deposit a thick sacrificial layer e.g. low stress glass filling the nozzle cavity. Planarize the sacrificial layer down to the nitride surface. This step is shown in .

10. Using the same mask etch down through the nitride and CMOS oxide layers to second level metal. This step is shown in .

11. Deposit and pattern 0.5 microns of gold using a lift off process using Mask 3. This mask defines the heater pattern. This step is shown in .

13. Etch both layers of PTFE down to sacrificial glass using Mask 4. This mask defines the gap at the edges of the main actuator paddle and the refill actuator paddle. This step is shown in .

14. Mount the wafer on a glass blank and back etch the wafer using KOH with no mask. This etch thins the wafer and stops at the buried boron doped silicon layer. This step is shown in .

16. Plasma back etch through the boron doped layer using Mask 6. This mask defines the nozzle and the edge of the chips.

17. Plasma back etch nitride up to the glass sacrificial layer through the holes in the boron doped silicon layer. At this stage the chips are separate but are still mounted on the glass blank. This step is shown in .

In a preferred embodiment an array of the nozzle arrangements is provided with each of the nozzles being under the influence of a outside pulsed magnetic field. The outside pulsed magnetic field causes selected nozzle arrangements to eject ink from their ink nozzle chambers.

Turning initially to and there is illustrated a side perspective view partly in section of a single ink jet nozzle arrangement . illustrates the nozzle arrangement in a quiescent position and illustrates the nozzle arrangement in an ink ejection position. The nozzle arrangement has an ink ejection port for the ejection of ink on demand. The ink ejection port is connected to an ink nozzle chamber which is usually filled with ink and supplied from an ink reservoir via holes e.g. .

A magnetic actuation device is included and comprises a magnetic soft core which is surrounded by a nitride coating e.g. . The nitride coating includes an end protuberance .

The magnetic core operates under the influence of an external pulsed magnetic field. Hence when the external magnetic field is very high the actuator is caused to move rapidly downwards and to thereby cause the ejection of ink from the ink ejection port . Adjacent the actuator is provided a blocking mechanism which comprises a thermal actuator which includes a copper resistive circuit having two arms . A current is passed through the connected arms thereby causing them to be heated. The arm being of a thinner construction undergoes more resistive heating than the arm which has a much thicker structure. The arm is also of a serpentine nature and is encased in polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE which has a high coefficient of thermal expansion thereby increasing the degree of expansion upon heating. The copper portions expand with the PTFE portions by means of a concertina like movement. The arm has a thinned portion which becomes the concentrated bending region in the resolution of the various forces activated upon heating. Hence any bending of the arm is accentuated in the portion and upon heating the region bends so that end portion moves out to block any downward movement of the edge of the actuator . Hence when it is desired to eject an ink drop from a particular nozzle chamber the blocking mechanism is not activated and as a result ink is ejected from the ink ejection port during the next external magnetic pulse phase. When the nozzle arrangement is not to eject ink the locking mechanism is activated to block any movement of the actuator and therefore stop the ejection of ink from the port . Movement of the blocking mechanism is indicated at in .

Importantly the actuator is located within a cavity such that the volume of ink flowing past the arm is extremely low whereas the arm receives a much larger volume of ink flow during operation.

Turning now to there is illustrated an exploded perspective view of a single nozzle arrangement illustrating the various layers which make up the nozzle arrangement . The nozzle arrangement can be constructed on a semiconductor wafer utilizing standard semiconductor processing techniques in addition to those techniques commonly used for the construction of micro electromechanical systems MEMS . At the bottom level is constructed a nozzle plate including the ink ejection port . The nozzle plate can be constructed from a buried boron doped epitaxial layer of a silicon wafer which has been back etched to the point of the epitaxial layer. The epitaxial layer itself is then etched utilizing a mask so as to form a nozzle rim See and the ejection port .

Next the silicon wafer layer is etched to define the nozzle chamber . The silicon layer is etched to contain substantially vertical side walls by using high density low pressure plasma etching such as that available from Surface Technology Systems and subsequently filled with sacrificial material which is later etched away.

On top of the silicon layer is deposited a two level CMOS circuitry layer which comprises substantially glass in addition to the usual metal and poly layers. A layer includes the formation of the heater element contacts which can be constructed from copper. The PTFE layer can be provided as a departure from normal construction with a bottom PTFE layer being first deposited followed by a copper layer and a second PTFE layer to cover the copper layer .

Next a nitride passivation layer is provided which acts to provide a passivation surface for the lower layers in addition to providing a base for a soft magnetic Nickel Ferrous layer which forms the magnetic actuator portion of the actuator . The nitride layer includes bending portions utilized in the bending of the actuator.

Next a nitride passivation layer is provided so as to passivate the top and side surfaces of the nickel iron NiFe layer .

One form of detailed manufacturing process which can be used to fabricate monolithic ink jet printheads operating in accordance with the principles taught by the present embodiment can proceed utilizing the following steps 

In a preferred embodiment there is provided an ink jet nozzle and chamber filled with ink. Within said jet nozzle chamber is located a static coil and a movable coil. When energized the static and movable coils are attracted towards one another loading a spring. The ink drop is ejected from the nozzle when the coils are de energized. Turn now to there is illustrated schematically the operation of a preferred embodiment. In there is shown a single ink jet nozzle chamber having an ink ejection port and ink meniscus in this position . Inside the nozzle chamber are located a fixed or static coil and a movable coil . The arrangement of illustrates the quiescent state in the ink jet nozzle chamber.

The two coils are then energized resulting in an attraction to one another. This results in the movable plate moving towards the static or fixed plate as illustrated in . As a result of the movement springs are loaded. Additionally the movement of coil may cause ink to flow out of the chamber in addition to a change in the shape of the meniscus . The coils are energized for long enough for the moving coil to reach its position approximate two microseconds . The coil currents are then turned to a lower level while the nozzle fills. The keeper power can be substantially less than the maximum current level used to move the plate because the magnetic gap between the plates and is at a minimum when the moving coil is at its stop position. The surface tension on the meniscus inserts a net force on the ink which results in nozzle refilling as illustrated in . The nozzle refilling replaces the volume of the piston withdrawal with ink in a process which should take approximately 100 microseconds.

Turning to the coil current is then turned off and the movable coil acts as a plunger which is accelerated to its normal position by the springs as illustrated in . The spring force on the plunger coil will be greatest at the beginning of its stroke and slows as the spring elastic stress falls to zero. As a result the acceleration of plunger plate is high at the beginning of the stroke but decreases during the stroke resulting in a more uniform ink velocity during the stroke. The movement plate causes the meniscus to bulge and break off performing ink drop . The plunger coil in turn settles in its quiescent position until the next drop ejection cycle.

Turning now to there is illustrated a perspective view of one form of construction of an ink jet nozzle . The ink jet nozzle can be constructed on a silicon wafer base as part of a large array of nozzles which can be formed for the purposes of providing a printhead having a certain dpi for example a 1600 dpi printhead. The printhead can be constructed using advanced silicon semi conductor fabrication and micro machining and micro fabrication process technology. The wafer is first processed to include lower level drive circuitry not shown before being finished off with a two microns thick layer with appropriate vias for interconnection. Preferably the CMOS layer can include one level of metal for providing basic interconnects. On top of the layer is constructed a nitride layer in which is embedded two coil layers and . The coil layers can be embedded within the nitride layer through the utilisation of the well known dual damascene process and chemical mechanical planarization techniques Chemical Mechanical Planarisation of Micro Electronic Materials by Sterger Wald et al published 1997 by John Wiley and Sons Inc. New York N.Y. . The two coils are interconnected using a fire at their central point and are further connected by appropriate vias at ends to the end points . Similarly the movable coil can be formed from two copper coils which are encased within a further nitride layer . The copper coil and nitride layer also include torsional springs which are formed so that the top moveable coil has a stable state away from the bottom fixed coil. Upon passing a current through the various copper coils the top copper coils are attracted to the bottom copper coils thereby resulting in a loading being placed on the torsional springs such that when the current is turned off the springs act to move the top moveable coil to its original position. The nozzle chamber can be formed via nitride wall portions e.g. having slots e.g. between adjacent wall portions. The slots allow for the flow of ink into the chamber as required. A top nitride plate is provided to cap the top of the internals of and to provide in flow channel support. The nozzle plate includes a series of holes provided to assist in sacrificial etching of lower level layers. Also provided is the ink injection nozzle having a ridge around its side so as to assist in resisting any in flow on to the outside surface of the nozzle . The etched through holes are of much smaller diameter than the nozzle hole and as such surface tension will act to retain the ink within the through holes of whilst simultaneously the injection of ink from nozzle .

As mentioned previously the various layers of the nozzle can be constructed in accordance with standard semi conductor and micro mechanical techniques. These techniques utilise the dual damascene process as mentioned earlier in addition to the utilisation of sacrificial etch layers to provide support for structures which are later released by means of etching the sacrificial layer.

The ink can be supplied within the nozzle by standard techniques such as providing ink channels along the side of the wafer so as to allow the flow of ink into the area under the surface of nozzle plate . Alternatively ink channel portals can be provided through the wafer by a high density low pressure plasma etch processing system such as that available from surface technology system and known as their Advanced Silicon Etch ASE process.

The nozzle chamber includes an ink ejection port for the ejection of ink on demand. Normally the nozzle chamber is filled with ink.

A linear actuator is provided for rapidly compressing a nickel ferrous plunger into the nozzle chamber so as to compress the volume of ink within chamber to thereby cause ejection of drops from the ink ejection port . The plunger is connected to the stepper moving pole device which is actuated by means of a three phase arrangement of electromagnets to . The electromagnets are driven in three phases with electro magnets and being driven in a first phase electromagnets being driven in a second phase and electromagnets being driven in a third phase. The electromagnets are driven in a reversible manner so as to de actuate plunger via actuator . The actuator is guided at one end by a means of guide . At the other end the plunger is coated with a hydrophobic material such as polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE which can form a major part of the plunger . The PTFE acts to repel the ink from the nozzle chamber resulting in the creation of a membrane e.g. See between the plunger and side walls e.g. . The surface tension characteristics of the membranes act to balanced one another thereby guiding the plunger within the nozzle chamber. The meniscus e.g. further stops ink from flowing out of the chamber and hence the electromagnets to can be operated in normal air.

The nozzle arrangement is therefore operated to eject drops on demand by means of activating the actuator by appropriately synchronised driving of electromagnets to . The actuation of the actuator results in the plunger moving towards the nozzle ink ejection port thereby causing ink to be ejected from the port .

Subsequently the electromagnets are driven in reverse thereby moving the plunger in an opposite direction resulting in the in flow of ink from an ink supply connected to the ink inlet port .

Preferably multiple ink nozzle arrangements can be constructed adjacent to one another to form a multiple nozzle ink ejection mechanism. The nozzle arrangements are preferably constructed in an array print head constructed on a single silicon wafer which is subsequently diced in accordance with requirements.

The nozzle arrangement can be constructed on top of a silicon wafer which has a standard electronic circuitry layer such as a two level metal CMOS layer . The two metal CMOS provides the drive and control circuitry for the ejection of ink from the nozzles by interconnection of the electromagnets to the CMOS layer. On top of the CMOS layer is a nitride passivation layer which passivates the lower layers against any ink erosion in addition to any etching of the lower CMOS glass layer should a sacrificial etching process be used in the construction of the nozzle arrangement .

On top of the nitride layer is constructed various other layers. The wafer layer the CMOS layer and the nitride passivation layer are constructed with the appropriate fires for interconnecting to the above layers. On top of the nitride layer is constructed a bottom copper layer which interconnects with the CMOS layer as appropriate. Next a nickel ferrous layer is constructed which includes portions for the core of the electromagnets and the actuator and guides . On top of the NiFe layer is constructed a second copper layer which forms the rest of the electromagnetic device. The copper layer can be constructed using a dual damascene process. Next a PTFE layer is laid down followed by a nitride layer which includes the side filter portions and side wall portions of the nozzle chamber.

In a preferred embodiment an ink jet nozzle chamber is provided having a shutter mechanism which open and closes over a nozzle chamber. The shutter mechanism includes a ratchet drive which slides open and close. The ratchet drive is driven by a gearing mechanism which in turn is driven by a drive actuator which is activated by passing an electric current through the drive actuator in a magnetic field. The actuator force is geared down so as to drive a ratchet and pawl mechanism to thereby open and shut the shutter over a nozzle chamber.

Turning to there is illustrated a single nozzle arrangement as shown in an open position. The nozzle arrangement includes a nozzle chamber having an anisotropic 111 crystallographic etched pit which is etched down to what is originally a boron doped buried epitaxial layer which includes a nozzle rim and a nozzle ejection port which ejects ink. The ink flows in through a fluid passage when the aperture is open. The ink flowing through passage flows from an ink reservoir which operates under an oscillating ink pressure. When the shutter is open ink is ejected from the ink ejection port . The shutter mechanism includes a plate which is driven via means of guide slots to a closed position. The driving of the nozzle plate is via a latch mechanism with the plate structure being kept in a correct path by means of retainers to .

The nozzle arrangement can be constructed using a two level poly process which can be a standard micro electro mechanical system production technique MEMS .

The copper portion includes serpentine sections which concertina upon movement of the end . The end is actuated by means of passing an electric current through the copper portions in the presence of a magnetic field perpendicular to the surface of the wafer such that the interaction of the magnetic field and circuit result in a Lorenz force acting on the actuator so as to move the end to drive the cogs . The copper portions are mounted on aluminum disks which are connected to lower levels of circuitry on the wafer upon which actuator is mounted.

Returning to the actuator can be driven at a high speed with the gear wheels to acting to gear down the high speed driving of actuator so as to drive ratchet mechanism open and closed on demand. Hence when it is desired to eject a drop of ink from nozzle the shutter is opened by means of driving actuator . Upon the next high pressure part of the oscillating pressure cycle ink will be ejected from the nozzle . If no ink is to be ejected from a subsequent cycle a second actuator is utilized to drive the gear wheel in the opposite direction thereby resulting in the closing of the shutter plate over the nozzle chamber resulting in no ink being ejected in subsequent pressure cycles. The pits act to reduce the forces required for driving the shutter plate to an open and closed position.

The layer is passivated by means of a nitride layer which includes trenches for passivating the side walls of glass layer .

On top of the passivation layer is provided a first level polysilicon layer which defines the shutter and various cog wheels. The second poly layer includes the various retainer mechanisms and gear wheel . Next a copper layer is provided for defining the copper circuit actuator. The copper is interconnected with lower portions of glass layer for forming the circuit for driving the copper actuator.

The nozzle chamber can be constructed using the standard MEMS processes including forming the various layers using the sacrificial material such as silicon dioxide and subsequently sacrificially etching the lower layers away.

Subsequently wafers that contain a series of print heads can be diced into separate printheads mounted on a wall of an ink supply chamber having a piezo electric oscillator actuator for the control of pressure in the ink supply chamber Ink is then ejected on demand by opening the shutter plate during periods of high oscillation pressure so as to eject ink. The nozzles being actuated by means of placing the printhead in a strong magnetic field using permanent magnets or electro magnetic devices and driving current through the actuators e.g. as required to open and close the shutter and thereby eject drops of ink on demand.

The magnetically actuated ink jet utilises utilizes a linear spring to increase the travel of a shutter grill which blocks any ink pressure variations in a nozzle when in a closed position. However when the shutter is open pressure variations are directly transmitted to the nozzle chamber and can result in the ejection of ink from the chamber. An oscillating ink pressure within an ink reservoir is used therefore to eject ink from nozzles having an open shutter grill.

In there is illustrated a single nozzle mechanism of a preferred embodiment when in a closed or rest position. The arrangement includes a shutter mechanism having shutters which are interconnected together by part at one end for providing structural stability. The two shutters are interconnected at another end to a moveable bar which is further connected to a stationary positioned bar via leaf springs . The moveable bar can be made of a soft magnetic NiFe material.

An electromagnetic actuator is utilized to attract the moveable bar generally in the direction of arrow . The electromagnetic actuator consists of a series of soft iron claws around which is formed a copper coil wire . The electromagnetic actuators can comprise a series of actuators interconnected via the copper coil windings. Hence when it is desired to open the shutters the coil is activated resulting in an attraction of bar towards the electromagnets . The attraction results in a corresponding interaction with linear springs and a movement of shutters to an open position as illustrated in . The result of the actuation being to open portals into a nozzle chamber thereby allowing the ejection of ink through an ink ejection nozzle .

The linear springs are designed to increase the movement of the shutter as a result of actuation by a factor of eight. A one micron motion of the bar towards the electromagnets will result in an eight micron sideways movement. This dramatically improves the efficiency of the system as any magnetic field falls off strongly with distance while the linear springs have a linear relationship between motion in one axis and the other. The use of the linear springs therefore allows the relatively large motion required to be easily achieved.

The surface of the wafer is directly immersed in an ink reservoir or in relatively large ink channels. An ultrasonic transducer for example a piezoelectric transducer not shown is positioned in the reservoir. The transducer oscillates the ink pressure at approximately 100 KHz. The ink pressure oscillation is sufficient that ink drops would be ejected from the nozzle when it is not blocked by the shutters . When data signals distributed on the print head indicate that a particular nozzle is to eject a drop of ink the drive transistor for that nozzle is turned on. This energises energizes the actuators which moves the shutters so that they are not blocking the ink chamber. The peak of the ink pressure variation causes the ink to be squirted out of the nozzle. As the ink pressure goes negative ink is drawn back into the nozzle causing drop break off. The shutters are kept open until the nozzle is refilled on the next positive pressure cycle. They are then shut to prevent the ink from being withdrawn from the nozzle on the next negative pressure cycle.

Each drop ejection takes two ink pressure cycles. Preferably half of the nozzles should eject drops in one phase and the other half of the nozzles should eject drops in the other phase. This minimizes the pressure variations which occur due to a large number of nozzles being actuated.

The amplitude of the ultrasonic transducer can be further altered in response to the viscosity of the ink which is typically affected by temperature and the number of drops which are to be ejected in a current cycle. This amplitude adjustment can be used to maintain consistent drop size in varying environmental conditions.

In there is illustrated a section taken through the line I I of so as to illustrate the nozzle chamber which can be formed utilizing an anisotropic crystallographic etch of the silicon substrate. The etch access through the substrate can be via the slots in the shutter grill.

The device is manufactured on silicon with a buried boron etch stop layer but rotated 45 in relation to the and planes. Therefore the planes which stop the crystallographic etch of the nozzle chamber form a 45 rectangle which superscribes the slots in the fixed grill. This etch will proceed quite slowly due to limited access of etchant to the silicon. However the etch can be performed at the same time as the bulk silicon etch which thins the bottom of the wafer.

In there is illustrated an exploded perspective view of the various layers formed in the construction of an ink jet print head . The layers include the boron doped layer which acts as an etch stop and can be derived from back etching a silicon wafer having a buried epitaxial layer as is well known in Micro Electro Mechanical Systems MEMS . The nozzle chamber side walls are formed from a crystallographic graphic etch of the wafer with the boron doped layer being utilized as an etch stop.

A subsequent layer is constructed for the provision of drive transistors and printer logic and can comprise a two level metal CMOS processing layer . The CMOS processing layer is covered by a nitride layer which includes portions which cover and protect the side walls of the CMOS layer . The copper layer can be constructed utilizing a dual damascene process. Finally a soft metal NiFe layer is provided for forming the rest of the actuator. Each of the layers are separately coated by a nitride insulating layer not shown which provides passivation and insulation and can be a standard 0.1 micron process.

The arrangement of therefore provides an ink jet nozzle having a high speed firing rate approximately 50 KHz which is suitable for fabrication in arrays of ink jet nozzles one along side another for fabrication as a monolithic page width print head.

35. Mount the print heads in their packaging which may be a molded plastic former incorporating ink channels which supply different colors of ink to the appropriate regions of the front surface of the wafer. The package also includes a piezoelectric actuator attached to the rear of the ink channels. The piezoelectric actuator provides the oscillating ink pressure required for the ink jet operation.

A preferred embodiment uses a Lorenz force on a current carrying wire in a magnetic field to actuate a diaphragm for the injection of ink from a nozzle chamber via a nozzle hole. The magnetic field is static and is provided by a permanent magnetic yoke around the nozzles of an ink jet head.

Referring initially to there is illustrated a single ink jet nozzle chamber apparatus as constructed in accordance with a preferred embodiment. Each ink jet nozzle includes a diaphragm of a corrugated form which is suspended over a nozzle chamber having a ink port for the injection of ink. The diaphragm is constructed from a number of layers including a plane copper coil layer which consists of a large number of copper coils which form a circuit for the flow of electric current across the diaphragm . The electric current in the wires of the diaphragm coil section all flowing in the same direction. is a perspective view of the current circuit utilized in the construction of a single ink jet nozzle illustrating the corrugated structure of the traces in the diaphragm of . A permanent magnetic yoke not shown is arranged so that the magnetic field is in the plane of the chip s surface perpendicular to the direction of current flow across the diaphragm coil .

In there is illustrated a sectional view of the ink jet nozzle taken along the line A Aof when the diaphragm has been activated by current flowing through coil wires . The diaphragm is forced generally in the direction of nozzle thereby resulting in ink within chamber being ejected out of port . The diaphragm and chamber are connected to an ink reservoir which after the ejection of ink via port results in a refilling of chamber from ink reservoir .

The movement of the diaphragm results from a Lorenz interaction between the coil current and the magnetic field.

The diaphragm is corrugated so that the diaphragm motion occurs as an elastic bending motion. This is important as a flat diaphragm may be prevented from flexing by tensile stress.

When data signals distributed on the printhead indicate that a particular nozzle is to eject a drop of ink the drive transistor for that nozzle is turned on. This energizes the coil causing elastic deformation of the diaphragm downwards ejecting ink. After approximately 3 s the coil current is turned off and the diaphragm returns to its quiescent position. The diaphragm return sucks some of the ink back into the nozzle causing the ink ligament connecting the ink drop to the ink in the nozzle to thin. The forward velocity of the drop and backward velocity of the ink in the chamber are resolved by the ink drop breaking off from the ink in the nozzle. The ink drop then continues towards the recording medium Ink refill of the nozzle chamber is via the two slots at either side of the diaphragm. The ink refill is caused by the surface tension of the ink meniscus at the nozzle.

Turning to the corrugated diaphragm can be formed by depositing a resist layer on top of a sacrificial glass layer . The resist layer is exposed using a mask having a halftone pattern delineating the corrugations.

After development as is illustrated in the resist contains the corrugation pattern. The resist layer and the sacrificial glass layer are then etched using an etchant that erodes the resist at substantially the same rate as the sacrificial glass . This transfers the corrugated pattern into the sacrificial glass layer as illustrated in . As illustrated in subsequently a nitride passivation layer is deposited followed a copper layer which is patterned using a coil mask. A further nitride passivation layer follows on top of the copper layer . Slots in the nitride layer at the side of the diaphragm can be etched and subsequently the sacrificial glass layer can be etched away leaving the corrugated diaphragm.

In there is illustrated an exploded perspective view of the various layers of an ink jet nozzle which is constructed on a silicon wafer having a buried boron doped epitaxial layer which is back etched in a final processing step including the etching of ink port . The silicon substrate as will be discussed below is an anisotropically crystallographically etched so as to form the nozzle chamber structure. On top of the silicon substrate layer is a CMOS layer which can comprise standard CMOS processing to form two level metal drive and control circuitry. On top of the CMOS layer is a first passivation layer which can comprise silicon nitride which protects the lower layers from any subsequent etching processes. On top of this layer is formed the copper layer having through holes e.g. to the CMOS layer for the supply of current. On top of the copper layer is a second nitrate passivation layer which provides for protection of the copper layer from ink and provides insulation.

The nozzle can be formed as part of an array of nozzles formed on a single wafer. After construction the wafer creating nozzles can be bonded to a second ink supply wafer having ink channels for the supply of ink such that the nozzle is effectively supplied with an ink reservoir on one side and ejects ink through the hole onto print media or the like on demand as required.

The nozzle chamber is formed using an anisotropic crystallographic etch of the silicon substrate. Etchant access to the substrate is via the slots at the sides of the diaphragm. The device is manufactured on silicon with a buried boron etch stop layer but rotated 45 in relation to the and planes. Therefore the planes which stop the crystallographic etch of the nozzle chamber form a 45 rectangle which superscribes the slot in the nitride layer. This etch will proceed quite slowly due to limited access of etchant to the silicon. However the etch can be performed at the same time as the bulk silicon etch which thins the wafer. The drop firing rate is around 7 KHz. The ink jet head is suitable for fabrication as a monolithic page wide print head. The illustration shows a single nozzle of a 1600 dpi print head in down shooter configuration.

25. Fill with ink apply a strong magnetic field in the plane of the chip surface and test the completed printheads. A filled nozzle is shown in .

In a preferred embodiment an oscillating ink reservoir pressure is used to eject ink from ejection nozzles. Each nozzle has an associated shutter which normally blocks the nozzle. The shutter is moved away from the nozzle by an actuator whenever an ink drop is to be fired.

Turning initially to there is illustrated in exploded perspective a single ink jet nozzle as constructed in accordance with the principles of the present invention. The exploded perspective illustrates a single ink jet nozzle . Ideally the nozzles are formed as an array at a time on a bottom silicon wafer . The silicon wafer is processed so as to have two level metal CMOS circuitry which includes metal layers and glass layers and which are planarized after construction. The CMOS metal layer has a reduced aperture for the access of ink from the back of silicon wafer via the larger radius portal .

A bottom nitride layer is constructed on top of the CMOS layer so as to cover protect and passivate the CMOS layer from subsequent etching processes. Subsequently there is provided a copper heater layer which is sandwiched between two polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE layers . The copper layer is connected to lower CMOS layer through vias . The copper layer and PTFE layers are encapsulated within nitride borders e.g. and nitride top layer which includes an ink ejection portal in addition to a number of sacrificial etched access holes which are of a smaller dimension than the ejection portal and are provided for allowing access of a etchant to lower sacrificial layers thereby allowing the use of a etchant in the construction of layers and .

Turning now to there is shown a cut out perspective view of a fully constructed ink jet nozzle . The ink jet nozzle uses an oscillating ink pressure to eject ink from ejection port . Each nozzle has an associated shutter which normally blocks it. The shutter is moved away from the ejection port opening by an actuator whenever an ink drop is to be fired.

The nozzles are in connected to ink chambers which contain the actuators . These chambers are connected to ink supply channels which are etched through the silicon wafer. The ink supply channels are substantially wider than the nozzles to reduce the fluidic resistance to the ink pressure wave. The ink channels are connected to an ink reservoir. An ultrasonic transducer for example a piezoelectric transducer is positioned in the reservoir. The transducer oscillates the ink pressure at approximately 100 KHz. The ink pressure oscillation is sufficient that ink drops would be ejected from the nozzle were it not blocked by the shutter .

The shutters are moved by a thermoelastic actuator . The actuators are formed as a coiled serpentine copper heater embedded in polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE . PTFE has a very high coefficient of thermal expansion approximately 770 10 . The current return trace from the heater is also embedded in the PTFE actuator the current return trace is made wider than the heater trace and is not serpentine. Therefore it does not heat the PTFE as much as the serpentine heater does. The serpentine heater is positioned along the inside edge of the PTFE coil and the return trace is positioned on the outside edge. When actuated the inside edge becomes hotter than the outside edge and expands more. This results in the actuator uncoiling.

The heater layer is etched in a serpentine manner both to increase its resistance and to reduce its effective tensile strength along the length of the actuator. This is so that the low thermal expansion of the copper does not prevent the actuator from expanding according to the high thermal expansion characteristics of the PTFE.

By varying the power applied to the actuator the shutter can be positioned between the fully on and fully off positions. This may be used to vary the volume of the ejected drop. Drop volume control may be used either to implement a degree of continuous tone operation to regulate the drop volume or both.

When data signals distributed on the printhead indicate that a particular nozzle is turned on the actuator is energized which moves the shutter so that it is not blocking the ink chamber. The peak of the ink pressure variation causes the ink to be squirted out of the nozzle . As the ink pressure goes negative ink is drawn back into the nozzle causing drop break off. The shutter is kept open until the nozzle is refilled on the next positive pressure cycle. It is then shut to prevent the ink from being withdrawn from the nozzle on the next negative pressure cycle.

Each drop ejection takes two ink pressure cycles. Preferably half of the nozzles should eject drops in one phase and the other half of the nozzles should eject drops in the other phase. This minimises the pressure variations which occur due to a large number of nozzles being actuated.

The amplitude of the ultrasonic transducer can be altered in response to the viscosity of the ink which is typically affected by temperature and the number of drops which are to be ejected in the current cycle. This amplitude adjustment can be used to maintain consistent drop size in varying environmental conditions.

The drop firing rate can be around 50 KHz. The ink jet head is suitable for fabrication as a monolithic page wide printhead. shows a single nozzle of a 1600 dpi printhead in up shooter configuration.

Return again to one method of construction of the ink jet print nozzles will now be described. Starting with the bottom wafer layer the wafer is processed so as to add CMOS layers with an aperture being inserted. The nitride layer is laid down on top of the CMOS layers so as to protect them from subsequent etchings.

A thin sacrificial glass layer is then laid down on top of nitride layers followed by a first PTFE layer the copper layer and a second PTFE layer . Then a sacrificial glass layer is formed on top of the PTFE layer and etched to a depth of a few microns to form the nitride border regions . Next the top layer is laid down over the sacrificial layer using the mask for forming the various holes including the processing step of forming the rim on nozzle . The sacrificial glass is then dissolved away and the channel formed through the wafer by means of utilisation of high density low pressure plasma etching such as that available from Surface Technology Systems.

One form of detailed manufacturing process which can be used to fabricate monolithic ink jet printheads operating in accordance with the principles taught by the present embodiment can proceed using the following steps

18. Back etch completely through the silicon wafer with for example an ASE Advanced Silicon Etcher from Surface Technology Systems using Mask 7. This mask defines the ink inlets which are etched through the wafer. The wafer is also diced by this etch. This step is shown in .

19. Etch the sacrificial material. The nozzle chambers are cleared the actuators freed and the chips are separated by this etch. This step is shown in .

20. Mount the printheads in their packaging which may be a molded plastic former incorporating ink channels which supply the appropriate color ink to the ink inlets at the back of the wafer. The package also includes a piezoelectric actuator attached to the rear of the ink channels. The piezoelectric actuator provides the oscillating ink pressure required for the ink jet operation.

21. Connect the printheads to their interconnect systems. For a low profile connection with minimum disruption of airflow TAB may be used. Wire bonding may also be used if the printer is to be operated with sufficient clearance to the paper.

In a preferred embodiment an inkjet printhead includes a shutter mechanism which interconnects the nozzle chamber with an ink supply reservoir the reservoir being under an oscillating ink pressure. Hence when the shutter is open ink is forced through the shutter mechanism and out of the nozzle chamber. Closing the shutter mechanism results in the nozzle chamber remaining in a stable state and not ejecting any ink from the chamber.

Turning initially to there is illustrated a single nozzle chamber as constructed in accordance with the principles of a preferred embodiment. The nozzle chamber can be constructed on a silicon wafer having an electrical circuitry layer which contains the control circuitry and drive transistors. The layer can comprise a two level metal CMOS layer or another suitable form of semi conductor processing layer. On top of the layer is deposited a nitride passivation layer . illustrates the shutter in a closed state while illustrates the shutter when in an open state.

Nitride layers including side walls and top portion are constructed to form the rest of a nozzle chamber . The top surface includes an ink ejection nozzle in addition to a number of smaller nozzles which are provided for sacrificial etching purposes. The nozzles are much smaller than the nozzle such that during operation surface tension effects restrict any ejection of ink from the nozzles .

In operation the ink supply channel is driven with an oscillating ink pressure. The oscillating ink pressure can be induced by means of driving a piezoelectric actuator in an ink chamber. When it is desired to eject a drop from the nozzle the shutter is opened forcing the drop of ink out of the nozzle during the next high pressure cycle of the oscillating ink pressure. The ejected ink is separated from the main body of ink within the nozzle chamber when the pressure is reduced. The separated ink continues to the paper. Preferably the shutter is kept open so that the ink channel may refill during the next high pressure cycle. Afterwards it is rapidly shut so that the nozzle chamber remains full during subsequent low cycles of the oscillating ink pressure. The nozzle chamber is then ready for subsequent refiring on demand.

The inkjet nozzle chamber can be constructed as part of an array of inkjet nozzles through MEMS depositing of the various layers utilizing the required masks starting with a CMOS layer on top of which the nitride layer is deposited having the requisite slots. A sacrificial glass layer can then be deposited followed by a bottom portion of the PTFE layer followed by the copper layer with the lower layers having suitable vias for interconnecting with the copper layer. Next an upper PTFE layer is deposited so as to encase to the copper layer within the PTFE layer . A further sacrificial glass layer is then deposited and etched before a nitride layer is deposited forming side walls and nozzle plate . The nozzle plate is etched to have suitable nozzle hole and sacrificial etching nozzles with the plate also being etched to form a rim around the nozzle hole . Subsequently the sacrificial glass layers can be etched away thereby releasing the structure of the actuator of the PTFE and copper layers. Additionally the wafer can be through etched utilizing a high density low pressure plasma etching process such as that available from Surface Technology Systems.

As noted previously many nozzles can be formed on a single wafer with the nozzles grouped into their desired width heads and the wafer diced in accordance with requirements. The diced printheads can then be interconnected to a printhead ink supply reservoir on the back portion thereof for operation producing a drop on demand ink jet printer.

A preferred embodiment utilises an ink reservoir with oscillating ink pressure and a shutter activated by a thermal actuator to eject drops of ink.

Turning now to there is illustrated two ink nozzle arrangements as constructed in accordance with a preferred embodiment. The ink nozzle arrangement is shown in an open position with the ink nozzle arrangement shown in a closed position. The ink nozzle arrangement of can be constructed as part of a large array of nozzles or print heads on a silicon wafer utilizing micro electro mechanical technologies MEMS .

In each of the ink nozzle arrangements covers an ink nozzle e.g. from which ejection of ink occurs when the ink nozzle arrangement is in an open state and the pressure wave is at a maximum.

Each of the ink nozzle arrangements of utilizes a thermocouple actuator device having two arms. The ink nozzle arrangement utilizes arms and the ink nozzle arrangement uses thermocouple arms . The thermocouple arms are responsible for movement of a grated shutter device within a shutter cage .

Referring now to there is illustrated the thermocouple arms and shutter of without the cage. The shutter includes a number of apertures for the passage of ink through the shutter when the shutter is in an open state. The thermocouple arms are responsible for movement of the shutter upon activation of the thermocouple by means of an electric current flowing through bonding pads . The thermal actuator of operates along similar principles to that disclosed in the aforementioned proceedings by the authors J. Robert Reid Victor M. Bright and John. H. Comtois with a number of significant differences in operation which will now be discussed. The arm can comprise an inner core of poly silicon surrounded by an outer jacket of thermally insulating material. The cross section of the arm is illustrated in and includes the inner core and the outer jacket .

A current is passed through the two arms via bonding pads . The arm includes the inner core which is an inner resistive element preferably comprising polysilicon or the like which heats up upon a current being passed through it. The thermal jacket is provided to isolate the inner core from the ink chamber in which the arms are immersed.

It should be noted that the arm contains a thermal jacket whereas the arm does not include a thermal jacket. Hence the arm will be generally cooler than the arm and undergoes a different rate of thermal expansion. The two arms act together to form a thermal actuator. The thermocouple comprising arms results in movement of the shutter generally in the direction upon a current being passed through the two arms. Importantly the arm includes a thinned portion in which amplifies the radial movement of shutter around a central axis near the bonding pads in . This results in a magnification of the rotational effects of activation of the thermocouple resulting in an increased movement of the shutter . The thermocouples can be activated to move the shutter from the closed position as illustrated generally at in to an open position as illustrated at in .

Returning now to a second thermocouple actuator is also provided having first and second arms . The actuator operates on the same physical principles as the arm associated with the shutter system . The actuator is designed to be operated so as to lock the shutter in an open or closed position. The actuator locking the shutter in an open position is illustrated in . When in a closed position the arm locks the shutter by means of engagement of knob with a cavity on shutter not shown . After a short period the shutter is deactivated and the hot arm of the actuator begins to cool.

An example timing diagram of operation of each ink nozzle arrangement will now be described. In there is illustrated generally at a first pressure plot which illustrates the pressure fluctuation around an ambient pressure within the ink chamber of as a result of the driving of a piezoelectric actuator in a substantially sinusoidal manner. The pressure fluctuation is also substantially sinusoidal in nature and the printing cycle is divided into four phases being a drop formation phase a drop separation phase a drop refill phase and a drop settling phase .

Also shown in are clock timing diagrams and . The first diagram illustrates the control pulses received by the shutter thermal actuator of a single ink nozzle so as to open and close the shutter. The second clock timing diagram is directed to the operation of the second thermal actuator eg. of .

At the start of the drop formation phase when the pressure within the ink chamber is going from a negative pressure to a positive pressure the actuator is actuated at to an open state. Subsequently the shutter is also actuated at so that it also moves from a closed to an open position. Next the actuator is deactivated at thereby locking the shutter in an open position with the head of the actuator locking against one side of the shutter . Simultaneously the shutter is deactivated at to reduce the power consumption in the nozzle.

As the ink chamber and ink nozzle are in a positive pressure state at this time the ink meniscus will be expanding out of the ink nozzle.

Subsequently the drop separation phase is entered wherein the chamber undergoes a negative pressure causing a portion of the ink flowing out of the ink nozzle back into the chamber. This rapid flow causes ink bubble separation from the main body of ink. The ink bubble or jet then passes to the print media while the surface meniscus of the ink collapses back into the ink nozzle. Subsequently the pressure cycle enters the drop refill stage with the shutter still open with a positive pressure cycle experienced. This causes rapid refilling of the ink chamber. At the end of the drop re filling stage the actuator is opened at causing the now cold shutter to spring back to a closed position. Subsequently the actuator is closed at locking the shutter in the closed position thereby completing one cycle of printing. The closed shutter allows a drop settling stage to be entered which allows for the dissipation of any resultant ringing or transient in the ink meniscus position while the shutter is closed. At the end of the drop settling stage the state has returned to the start of the drop formation stage and another drop can be ejected from the ink nozzle.

Of course a number of refinements of operation are possible. In a first refinement the pressure wave oscillation which is shown to be a constant oscillation in magnitude and frequency can be altered in both respects. The size and period of each cycle can be scaled in accordance with such pre calculated factors such as the number of nozzles ejecting ink and the tuned pressure requirements for nozzle refill with different inks. Further the clock periods of operation can be scaled to take into account differing effects such as actuation speeds etc.

Turning now to there is illustrated at an exploded perspective view of one form of construction of the ink nozzle pair of .

The ink jet nozzles are constructed on a buried boron doped layer of a silicon wafer which includes fabricated nozzle rims e.g. which form part of the layer and limit any hydrophilic spreading of the meniscus on the bottom end of the layer . The nozzle rim e.g. can be dispensed with when the bottom surface of layer is suitably treated with a hydrophobizing process.

On top of the wafer is constructed a CMOS layer which contains all the relevant circuitry required for driving of the two nozzles. This CMOS layer is finished with a silicon dioxide layer . Both the CMOS layer and the silicon dioxide include triangular apertures and allowing for fluid communication with the nozzle ports e.g. .

On top of the SiOlayer are constructed the various shutter layers to . A first shutter layer is constructed from a first layer of polysilicon and comprises the shutter and actuator mechanisms. A second shutter layer can be constructed from a polymer for example polyamide and acts as a thermal insulator on one arm of each of the thermocouple devices. A final covering cage layer is constructed from a second layer of polysilicon.

The construction of the nozzles relies upon standard semi conductor fabrication processes and MEMS process known to those skilled in the art.

One form of construction of nozzle arrangement would be to utilize a silicon wafer containing a boron doped epitaxial layer which forms the final layer . The silicon wafer layer is formed naturally above the boron doped epitaxial . On top of this layer is formed the layer with the relevant CMOS circuitry etc. being constructed in this layer. The apertures can be formed within the layers by means of plasma etching utilizing an appropriate mask. Subsequently these layers can be passivated by means of a nitride covering and then filled with a sacrificial material such as glass which will be subsequently etched. A sacrificial material with an appropriate mask can also be utilized as a base for the moveable portions of the layer which are again deposited utilizing appropriate masks. Similar procedures can be carried out for the layers . Next the wafer can be thinned by means of back etching of the wafer to the boron doped epitaxial layer which is utilized as an etchant stop. Subsequently the nozzle rims and nozzle apertures can be formed and the internal portions of the nozzle chamber and other layers can be sacrificially etched away releasing the shutter structure. Subsequently the wafer can be diced into appropriate print heads attached to an ink chamber wafer and tested for operational yield.

Of course many other materials can be utilized to form the construction of each layer. For example the shutter and actuators could be constructed from tantalum or a number of other substances known to those skilled in the art of construction of MEMS devices.

It will be evident to the person skilled in the art that large arrays of ink jet nozzle pairs can be constructed on a single wafer and ink jet print heads can be attached to a corresponding ink chamber for driving of ink through the print head on demand to the required print media.

Further normal aspects of MEMS construction such as the utilization of dimples to reduce the opportunity for stiction while not specifically disclosed in the current embodiment could be used as means to improve yield and operation of the shutter device as constructed in accordance with a preferred embodiment.

One form of detailed manufacturing process which can be used to fabricate monolithic ink jet print heads operating in accordance with the principles taught by the present embodiment can proceed utilizing the following steps 

1. Using a double sided polished wafer deposit 3 microns of epitaxial silicon heavily doped with boron .

2. Deposit 10 microns of n n epitaxial silicon . Note that the epitaxial layer is substantially thicker than required for CMOS. This is because the nozzle chambers are crystallographically etched from this layer. This step is shown in . is a key to representations of various materials in these manufacturing diagrams and those of other cross referenced ink jet configurations. For clarity these diagrams may not be to scale and may not represent a cross section though any single plane of the nozzle.

3. Plasma etch the epitaxial silicon with approximately 90 degree sidewalls using MEMS Mask 1. This mask defines the nozzle cavity . The etch is timed for a depth approximately equal to the epitaxial silicon 10 microns to reach the boron doped silicon buried layer . This step is shown in .

4. Deposit 10 microns of low stress sacrificial oxide . Planarize down to silicon using CMP. The sacrificial material temporarily fills the nozzle cavity. This step is shown in .

5. Begin fabrication of the drive transistors data distribution and timing circuits using a CMOS process. The MEMS processes which form the mechanical components of the inkjet are interleaved with the CMOS device fabrication steps. The example given here is of a 1 micron poly 1 metal retrograde P well process. The mechanical components are formed from the CMOS polysilicon layers . For clarity the CMOS active components are omitted.

6. Grow the field oxide using standard LOCOS techniques to a thickness of 0.5 microns. As well as the isolation between transistors the field oxide is used as a MEMS sacrificial layer so inkjet mechanical details are incorporated in the active area mask. The MEMS features of this step are shown in .

7. Perform the PMOS field threshold implant. The MEMS fabrication has no effect on this step except in calculation of the total thermal budget.

8. Perform the retrograde P well and NMOS threshold adjust implants. The MEMS fabrication has no effect on this step except in calculation of the total thermal budget.

9. Perform the PMOS N tub deep phosphorus punchthrough control implant and shallow boron implant. The MEMS fabrication has no effect on this step except in calculation of the total thermal budget.

10. Deposit and etch the first polysilicon layer . As well as gates and local connections this layer includes the lower layer of MEMS components. This includes the shutter the shutter actuator and the catch actuator. It is preferable that this layer be thicker than the normal CMOS thickness. A polysilicon thickness of 1 micron can be used. The MEMS features of this step are shown in .

11. Perform the NMOS lightly doped drain LDD implant. This process is unaltered by the inclusion of MEMS in the process flow.

12. Perform the oxide deposition and RIE etch for polysilicon gate sidewall spacers. This process is unaltered by the inclusion of MEMS in the process flow.

13. Perform the NMOS source drain implant. The extended high temperature anneal time to reduce stress in the two polysilicon layers must be taken into account in the thermal budget for diffusion of this implant. Otherwise there is no effect from the MEMS portion of the chip.

14. Perform the PMOS source drain implant. As with the NMOS source drain implant the only effect from the MEMS portion of the chip is on thermal budget for diffusion of this implant.

15. Deposit 1.3 micron of glass as the first interlevel dielectric and etch using the CMOS contacts mask. The CMOS mask for this level also contains the pattern for the MEMS inter poly sacrificial oxide. The MEMS features of this step are shown in .

16. Deposit and etch the second polysilicon layer . As well as CMOS local connections this layer includes the upper layer of MEMS components. This includes the grill and the catch second layer which exists to ensure that the catch does not slip off the shutter. A polysilicon thickness of 1 micron can be used. The MEMS features of this step are shown in .

17. Deposit 1 micron of glass as the second interlevel dielectric and etch using the CMOS via 1 mask. The CMOS mask for this level also contains the pattern for the MEMS actuator contacts.

18. Deposit and etch the metal layer. None of the metal appears in the MEMS area so this step is unaffected by the MEMS process additions. However all required annealing of the polysilicon should be completed before this step. The MEMS features of this step are shown in .

19. Deposit 0.5 microns of silicon nitride SiN and etch using MEMS Mask 2. This mask defines the region of sacrificial oxide etch performed in step 24. The silicon nitride aperture is substantially undersized as the sacrificial oxide etch is isotropic. The CMOS devices must be located sufficiently far from the MEMS devices that they are not affected by the sacrificial oxide etch. The MEMS features of this step are shown in .

20. Mount the wafer on a glass blank and back etch the wafer using KOH with no mask. This etch thins the wafer and stops at the buried boron doped silicon layer. The MEMS features of this step are shown in .

21. Plasma back etch the boron doped silicon layer to a depth of 1 micron using MEMS Mask 3. This mask defines the nozzle rim . The MEMS features of this step are shown in .

22. Plasma back etch through the boron doped layer using MEMS Mask 4. This mask defines the nozzle and the edge of the chips. At this stage the chips are separate but are still mounted on the glass blank. The MEMS features of this step are shown in .

24. Etch the sacrificial oxide using vapor phase etching VPE using an anhydrous HF methanol vapor mixture. The use of a dry etch avoids problems with stiction. This step is shown in .

25. Mount the print heads in their packaging which may be a molded plastic former incorporating ink channels which supply different colors of ink to the appropriate regions of the front surface of the wafer. The package also includes a piezoelectric actuator attached to the rear of the ink channels. The piezoelectric actuator provides the oscillating ink pressure required for the ink jet operation.

In a preferred embodiment an ink jet printhead is constructed from an array of ink nozzle chambers which utilize a thermal actuator for the ejection of ink having a shape reminiscent of the calyx arrangement of a flower. The thermal actuator is activated so as to close the flower arrangement and thereby cause the ejection of ink from a nozzle chamber formed in the space above the calyx arrangement. The calyx arrangement has particular advantages in allowing for rapid refill of the nozzle chamber in addition to efficient operation of the thermal actuator.

Turning to there is shown a perspective sectional view of a single nozzle chamber of a printhead as constructed in accordance with a preferred embodiment. The printhead arrangement is based around a calyx type structure which includes a plurality of petals e.g. which are constructed from polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE . The petals include an internal resistive element which can comprise a copper heater. The resistive element is generally of a serpentine structure such that upon heating the resistive element can concertina and thereby expand at the rate of expansion of the PTFE petals e.g. . The PTFE petal has a much higher coefficient thermal expansion 770 10 and therefore undergoes substantial expansion upon heating. The resistive elements are constructed nearer to the lower surface of the PTFE petal and as a result the bottom surface of PTFE petal is heated more rapidly than the top surface. The difference in thermal grading results in a bending upwards of the petals upon heating. Each petal e.g. is heated together which results in a combined upward movement of all the petals at the same time which in turn results in the imparting of momentum to the ink within chamber such that ink is forced out of the ink nozzle . The forcing out of ink out of ink nozzle results in an expansion of the meniscus and subsequently results in the ejection of drops of ink from the nozzle .

An important advantageous feature of a preferred embodiment is that PTFE is normally hydrophobic. In a preferred embodiment the bottom surface of petals comprises untreated PTFE and is therefore hydrophobic. This results in an air bubble forming under the surface of the petals. The air bubble contracts on upward movement of petals as illustrated in which illustrates a cross sectional perspective view of the form of the nozzle after activation of the petal heater arrangement.

The top of the petals is treated so as to reduce its hydrophobic nature. This can take many forms including plasma damaging in an ammonia atmosphere. The top of the petals is treated so as to generally make it hydrophilic and thereby attract ink into nozzle chamber .

Returning now to the nozzle chamber is constructed from a circular rim of an inert material such as nitride as is the top nozzle plate . The top nozzle plate can include a series of the small etchant holes which are provided to allow for the rapid etching of sacrificial material used in the construction of the nozzle chamber . The etchant holes are large enough to allow the flow of etchant into the nozzle chamber however they are small enough so that surface tension effects retain any ink within the nozzle chamber . A series of posts are further provided for support of the nozzle plate on a wafer .

The wafer can comprise a standard silicon wafer on top of which is constructed data drive circuitry which can be constructed in the usual manner such as two level metal CMOS with portions of one level of metal aluminium being used for providing interconnection with the copper circuitry portions .

The arrangement of has a number of significant advantages in that in the petal open position the nozzle chamber can experience rapid refill especially where a slight positive ink pressure is utilised. Further the petal arrangement provides a degree of fault tolerance in that if one or more of the petals is non functional the remaining petals can operate so as to eject drops of ink on demand.

Turning now to there is illustrated an exploded perspective of the various layers of a nozzle arrangement . The nozzle arrangement is constructed on a base wafer which can comprise a silicon wafer suitably diced in accordance with requirements. On the silicon wafer is constructed a silicon glass layer which can include the usual CMOS processing steps to construct a two level metal CMOS drive and control circuitry layer. Part of this layer will include portions which are provided for interconnection with the drive transistors. On top of the CMOS layer is constructed a nitride passivation layer which provides passivation protection for the lower layers during operation and also should an etchant be utilized which would normally dissolve the lower layers. The PTFE layer really comprises a bottom PTFE layer below a copper metal layer and a top PTFE layer above it however they are shown as one layer in . Effectively the copper layer is encased in the PTFE layer as a result. Finally a nitride layer is provided so as to form the rim of the nozzle chamber and nozzle posts in addition to the nozzle plate.

The arrangement can be constructed on a silicon wafer using micro electro mechanical systems techniques. The PTFE layer can be constructed on a sacrificial material base such as glass wherein a via for stem of layer is provided.

The layer is constructed on a second sacrificial etchant material base so as to form the nitride layer . The sacrificial material is then etched away using a suitable etchant which does not attack the other material layers so as to release the internal calyx structure. To this end the nozzle plate includes the aforementioned etchant holes e.g. so as to speed up the etching process in addition to the nozzle and the nozzle rim .

The nozzles can be formed on a wafer of printheads as required. Further the printheads can include supply means either in the form of a through the wafer ink supply means which uses high density low pressure plasma etching such as that available from Surface Technology Systems or via means of side ink channels attached to the side of the printhead. Further areas can be provided for the interconnection of circuitry to the wafer in the normal fashion as is normally utilized with MEMS processes.

One form of detailed manufacturing process which can be used to fabricate monolithic ink jet printheads operating in accordance with the principles taught by the present embodiment can proceed utilizing the following steps 

1. Using a double sided polished wafer Complete drive transistors data distribution and timing circuits using a 0.5 micron one poly 2 metal CMOS process . This step is shown in . For clarity these diagrams may not be to scale and may not represent a cross section though any single plane of the nozzle. is a key to representations of various materials in these manufacturing diagrams and those of other cross referenced ink jet configurations.

2. Etch through the silicon dioxide layers of the CMOS process down to silicon using mask 1. This mask defines the ink inlet channels and the heater contact vias . This step is shown in .

3. Deposit 1 micron of low stress nitride . This acts as a barrier to prevent ink diffusion through the silicon dioxide of the chip surface. This step is shown in .

5. Etch the sacrificial layer using mask 2. This mask defines the actuator anchor point. This step is shown in .

19. Etch down to the sacrificial layer using mask 9. This mask defines the nozzle and the sacrificial etch access holes . This step is shown in .

20. Back etch completely through the silicon wafer with for example an ASE Advanced Silicon Etcher from Surface Technology Systems using mask 10. This mask defines the ink inlets which are etched through the wafer. The wafer is also diced by this etch. This step is shown in .

21. Etch the sacrificial material. The nozzle chambers are cleared the actuators freed and the chips are separated by this etch. This step is shown in .

22. Mount the printheads in their packaging which may be a molded plastic former incorporating ink channels which supply the appropriate color ink to the ink inlets at the back of the wafer.

23. Connect the printheads to their interconnect systems. For a low profile connection with minimum disruption of airflow TAB may be used. Wire bonding may also be used if the printer is to be operated with sufficient clearance to the paper.

Turning initially to in a preferred embodiment of a printing mechanism there is provided an ink reservoir which is supplied from an ink supply conduit . A piezoelectric actuator is driven in a substantially sine wave form so as to set up pressure waves within the reservoir . The ultrasonic transducer typically comprises a piezoelectric transducer positioned within the reservoir . The transducer oscillates the ink pressure within the reservoir at approximately 100 KHz. The pressure is sufficient to eject the ink drops from each of a number of nozzle arrangements when required. Each nozzle arrangement is provided with a shutter which is opened and closed on demand.

Each nozzle arrangement includes an ink ejection port for the output of ink and a nozzle chamber which is normally filled with ink. Further each nozzle arrangement is provided with a shutter which is designed to open and close the nozzle chamber on demand. The shutter is actuated by a coiled thermal actuator .

The coiled actuator is constructed from laminated conductors of either differing resistivities different cross sectional areas different indices of thermal expansion different thermal conductivities to the ink different length or some combination thereof. A coiled radius of the actuator changes when a current is passed through the conductors as one side of the coiled actuator expands differently to the other. One method as illustrated in can be to utilize two current paths which are made of electrically conductive material. The current paths are connected at the shutter end of the thermal actuator . One current path is etched in a serpentine manner to increase its resistance. When a current is passed through paths the side of the coiled actuator that comprises the serpentine path expands more than the side that comprises the paths . This results in the actuator uncoiling.

The thermal actuator controls the position of the shutter so that it can cover none all or part of the nozzle chamber . If the shutter does not cover any of the nozzle chamber then the oscillating ink pressure will be transmitted to the nozzle chamber and the ink will be ejected out of the ejection port . When the shutter covers the ink chamber then the oscillating ink pressure of the chamber is significantly attenuated at the ejection port . The ink pressure within the chamber will not be entirely stopped due to leakage around the shutter when in a closed position and fixing of the shutter under varying pressures.

The shutter may also be driven to be partly across the nozzle chamber resulting in a partial attenuation of the ink pressure variation. This can be used to vary the volume of the ejected drop. This can be utilized to implement a degree of continuation tone operation of the printing mechanism to regulate the drop volume or both. The shutter is normally shut and is opened on demand.

Referring to the piezoelectric device is driven in a sinusoidal manner which in turn causes a sinusoidal variation in the pressure within the ink reservoir with respect to time.

The operation of the printing mechanism utilizes four phases being an ink ejection phase an ink separation phase an ink refill phase and an idle phase .

Referring now to before the ink ejection phase of the shutter is located over the ink chamber and the ink forms a meniscus over the ejection port .

At the start of the ejection phase the actuator coil is activated and the shutter moves away from its position over the chamber as illustrated in . As the chamber undergoes positive pressure the meniscus grows and the volume of ink outside the ejection port increases due to an ink flow . Subsequently the separation phase of is entered. In this phase the pressure within the chamber becomes less than the ambient pressure. This causes a back flow within the chamber and results in the separation of a body of ink from the ejection port . The meniscus moves up into the ink chamber .

Subsequently the ink chamber enters the refill phase of wherein positive pressure is again experienced. This results in the condition indicated by in wherein the meniscus is positioned at to return to that of . Subsequently as illustrated in the actuator is turned off and the shutter returns to its original position ready for reactivation idle phase of .

The cyclic operation as illustrated in has a number of advantages. In particular the level and duration of each sinusoidal cycle can be closely controlled by means of controlling the signal to the piezo electric actuator . Of course a number of further variations are possible. For example as each drop ejection takes two ink pressure cycles half the nozzle arrangements of could be ejected in one phase and the other half of the nozzle arrangements could be ejected during a second phase. This allows for minimization of the pressure variations which would occur if a large number of nozzle arrangements were actuated simultaneously.

Further the amplitude of the driving signal to the actuator can be altered in response to the viscosity of the ink which will typically be effected by such factors as temperature and the number of drops which are to be ejected in the current cycle.

Each nozzle arrangement further includes drive circuitry which activates the actuator coil when the shutter is to be opened. The nozzle chamber should be carefully dimensioned and a radius of the ejection port carefully selected to control the drop velocity and drop size. Further the nozzle chamber of should be wide enough so that viscous drag from the chamber walls dots not significantly increase the force required from the ultrasonic oscillator.

Preferably the shutter is of a disk form which covers the nozzle chamber . The disk preferably has a honeycomb like structure to maximize strength while minimizing its inertial mass.

Preferably all surfaces are coated with a passivation layer so as to reduce the possibility of corrosion from the ink flow. A suitable passivation layer can include silicon nitride SiN diamond like carbon DLC or any other chemically inert highly impermeable layer. The passivation layer is especially important for device lifetime as the active device will be immersed in ink.

1 Start with a single crystal silicon wafer which has a buried epitaxial layer of silicon which is heavily doped with boron. The boron should be doped to preferably 10atoms per cmof boron or more and be approximately 2 micron thick. The lightly doped silicon epitaxial layer on top of the boron doped layer should be approximately 8 micron thick and be doped in a manner suitable for the active semiconductor device technology chosen. This is hereinafter called the Sopij wafer. The wafer diameter should be the same as the ink channel wafer.

2 Fabricate the drive transistors and data distribution circuitry according to the process chosen in the CMOS layer up until the oxide extends over second level metal.

4 Plasma etch the nozzle chamber stopping at the boron doped epitaxial silicon layer. This etch will be through around 8 micron of silicon. The etch should be highly anisotropic with near vertical sidewalls. The etch stop determination can be the detection of boron in the exhaust gases. This step also etches the edge of printhead chips down to the boron layer for later separation.

5 Conformally deposit 0.2 microns of high density SiN. This forms a corrosion barrier so should be free of pinholes and be impermeable to OH ions.

6 Deposit a thick sacrificial layer. This layer should entirely fill the nozzle chambers and coat the entire wafer to an added thickness of 2 microns. The sacrificial layer may be SiO for example spin or glass SOG .

9 Mask and etch the SiNlayer using the coil electric contacts mask a first layer of PTFE layer using the coil mask.

15 Permanently bond the wafer onto a pre fabricated ink channel wafer. The active side of the Sopij wafer faces the ink channel wafer.

16 Etch the Sopij wafer to entirely remove the backside silicon to the level of the boron doped epitaxial layer. This etch can be a batch wet etch in ethylene diamine pyrocatechol EPD .

17 Mask the ejection ports from the underside of the Sopij wafer. This mask also includes the chip edges.

18 Etch through the boron doped silicon layer . This etch should also etch fairly deeply into the sacrificial material in the nozzle chambers to reduce time required to remove the sacrificial layer.

19 Completely etch the sacrificial material. If this material is SiO then an HF etch can be used. Access of the HF to the sacrificial layer material is through the ejection port and simultaneously through an ink channel in the chip.

20 Separate the chips from the backing plate. The two wafers have already been etched through so the printheads do not need to be diced.

One alternative form of detailed manufacturing process which can be used to fabricate monolithic ink jet printheads operating in accordance with the principles taught by the present embodiment can proceed utilizing the following steps 

1. Using a double sided polished wafer deposit 3 microns of epitaxial silicon heavily doped with boron.

2. Deposit 10 microns of epitaxial silicon either p type or n type depending upon the CMOS process used.

3. Complete drive transistors data distribution and timing circuits using a 0.5 micron one poly 2 metal CMOS process . The wafer is passivated with 0.1 microns of silicon nitride . This step is shown in . For clarity these diagrams may not be to scale and may not represent a cross section though any single plane of the nozzle arrangement . is a key to representations of various materials in these manufacturing diagrams and those of other cross referenced ink jet configurations.

4. Etch the CMOS oxide layers down to silicon using Mask 1. This mask defines the nozzle chamber below the shutter and the edges of the printhead chips.

5. Plasma etch the silicon down to the boron doped buried layer using oxide from step 4 as a mask. This step is shown in .

8. Etch the sacrificial layer using Mask 2. This mask defines the actuator anchor point . This step is shown in .

10. Etch the PTFE nitride and oxide down to second level metal using Mask 3. This mask defines the heater vias. This step is shown in .

14. Etch the PTFE down to the sacrificial layer using Mask 5. This mask defines the actuator and shutter . This step is shown in .

15. Wafer probe. All electrical connections are complete at this point bond pads are accessible and the chips are not yet separated.

16. Mount the wafer on a glass blank and back etch the wafer using KOH with no mask. This etch thins the wafer and stops at the buried boron doped silicon layer . This step is shown in .

17. Plasma back etch the boron doped silicon layer to a depth of approx. 1 micron using Mask 6. This mask defines the nozzle rim . This step is shown in .

18. Plasma back etch through the boron doped layer using Mask 7. This mask defines the nozzle and the edge of the chips. At this stage the chips are separate but are still mounted on the glass blank . This step is shown in .

19. Detach the chips from the glass blank and etch the sacrificial material. The nozzle chambers are cleared the actuators freed and the chips are separated by this etch. This step is shown in .

20. Mount the printheads in their packaging which may be a molded plastic former incorporating ink channels which supply different colors of ink to the appropriate regions of the front surface of the wafer.

In a preferred embodiment there is a provided an ink jet printhead which includes a series of nozzle arrangements each nozzle arrangement including an actuator device comprising a plurality of actuators which actuate a series of paddles that operate in an iris type motion so as to cause the ejection of ink from a nozzle chamber.

Turning initially to to there is illustrated a single nozzle arrangement for the ejection of ink from an ink ejection port . The ink is ejected out of the port from a nozzle chamber which is formed from substantially identical iris vanes . Each iris vane is operated simultaneously to cause the ink within the nozzle chamber to be squeezed out of the nozzle chamber thereby ejecting the ink from the ink ejection port .

Each nozzle vane is actuated by means of a thermal actuator positioned at its base. Each thermal actuator has two arms namely an expanding flexible arm and a rigid arm . Each actuator is fixed at one end and is displaceable at an opposed end . Each expanding arm can be constructed from a polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE layer inside of which is constructed a serpentine copper heater . The rigid arm of the thermal actuator comprises return trays of the copper heater and the vane . The result of the heating of the expandable arms of the thermal actuators is that the outer PTFE layer of each actuator is caused to bend around thereby causing the vanes to push ink towards the centre of the nozzle chamber . The serpentine trays of the copper layer concertina in response to the high thermal expansion of the PTFE layer . The other vanes are operated simultaneously. The four vanes therefore cause a general compression of the ink within the nozzle chamber resulting in a subsequent ejection of ink from the ink ejection port .

A roof of the nozzle arrangement is formed from a nitride layer and is supported by posts . The roof includes a series of holes which are provided in order to facilitate rapid etching of sacrificial materials within lower layers during construction. The holes are provided of a small diameter such that surface tension effects are sufficient to stop any ink being ejected from the nitride holes as opposed to the ink ejection port upon activation of the iris vanes .

The arrangement of can be constructed on a silicon wafer utilizing standard semi conductor fabrication and micro electro mechanical systems MEMS techniques. The nozzle arrangement can be constructed on a silicon wafer and built up by utilizing various sacrificial materials where necessary as is common practice with MEMS constructions. Turning to there is illustrated an exploded perspective view of a single nozzle arrangement illustrating the various layers utilized in the construction of a single nozzle. The lowest layer of the construction comprises a silicon wafer base . A large number of printheads each having a large number of print nozzles in accordance with requirements can be constructed on a single large wafer which is appropriately diced into separate printheads in accordance with requirements. On top of the silicon wafer layer is first constructed a CMOS circuitry glass layer which provides all the necessary interconnections and driving control circuitry for the various heater circuits. On top of the CMOS layer is constructed a nitride passivation layer which is provided for passivating the lower CMOS layer against any etchants which may be utilized.

In a preferred embodiment ink is ejected from a nozzle arrangement by bending of a thermal actuator so as to eject t ink.

Turning now to there is illustrated a single nozzle arrangement of a preferred embodiment. The nozzle arrangement includes a thermal actuator located above a nozzle chamber and an ink ejection port . The thermal actuator includes an electrical circuit comprising leads connected to a serpentine resistive element . The resistive element can comprise the copper layer in this respect a copper stiffener is provided to provide support for one end of the thermal actuator .

The copper resistive element is constructed in a serpentine manner to provide very little tensile strength along the length of the thermal actuator panel .

The copper resistive element is embedded in a polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE layer . The PTFE layer has a very high coefficient of thermal expansion approximately 770 10 6 . This layer undergoes rapid expansion when heated by the copper heater . The copper heater is positioned closer to a top surface of the PTFE layer thereby heating an upper layer of the PTFE layer faster than the bottom layer resulting in a bending down of the thermal actuator towards the ejection port .

1 When data signals distributed on the printhead indicate that the nozzle arrangement is to eject a drop of ink a drive transistor for the nozzle arrangement is turned on. This energizes the leads and the heater in the actuator of the nozzle arrangement. The heater is energized for approximately 3 microseconds with the actual duration depending upon the design chosen for the nozzle arrangement.

2 The heater heats the PTFE layer with the top layer of the PTFE layer being heated more rapidly than the bottom layer. This causes the actuator to bend generally towards the ejection port in to the nozzle chamber as illustrated in . The bending of the actuator pushes ink from the ink chamber out of the ejection .

3 When the heater current is turned off the actuator begins to return to its quiescent position. The return of the actuator sucks some of the ink back into the nozzle chamber causing an ink ligament connecting the ink drop to the ink in the chamber to thin. The forward velocity of the drop and backward velocity of the ink in the chamber are resolved by the ink drop breaking off from the ink in the chamber . The ink drop then continues towards the recording medium.

In order to construct a series of the nozzle arrangement the following major parts need to be constructed 

2 The ejection port . The radius of the ejection port is an important determinant of drop velocity and drop size.

3 The actuator is constructed of a heater layer embedded in the PTFE layer . The actuator is fixed at one side of the ink chamber and the other end is suspended over the ejection port . Approximately half of the actuator contains the copper element . A heater section of the element is proximate the fixed end of the actuator .

4 The nozzle chamber . The nozzle chamber is slightly wider than the actuator . The gap between the actuator and the nozzle chamber is determined by the fluid dynamics of the ink ejection and refill process. If the gap is too large much of the actuator force will be wasted on pushing ink around the edges of the actuator. If the gap is too small the ink refill time will be too long. Also if the gap is too small the crystallographic etch of the nozzle chamber will take too long to complete. A 2 micron gap will usually be sufficient. The nozzle chamber is also deep enough so that air ingested through the ejection port when the actuator returns to its quiescent state does not extend to the actuator. If it does the ingested bubble may form a cylindrical surface instead of a hemispherical surface. If this happens the chamber will not refill properly. A depth of approximately 20 micron is suitable.

5 Nozzle chamber ledges . As the actuator moves approximately 10 microns and a crystallographic etch angle of chamber surface is 54.74 degrees a gap of around 7 micron is required between the edge of the paddle and the outermost edge of the nozzle chamber . The walls of the nozzle chamber must also clear the ejection port . This requires that the nozzle chamber be approximately 52 micron wide whereas the actuator is only 30 micron wide. Were there to be an 11 micron gap around the actuator too much ink would flow around to the sides of the actuator when the actuator is energized. To prevent this the nozzle chamber is undercut 9 micron into the silicon surrounding the paddle leaving a 9 micron wide ledge to prevent ink flow around the actuator .

Two wafers are required a wafer upon which the active circuitry and nozzles are fabricated the print head wafer and a further wafer in which the ink channels are fabricated. This is the ink channel wafer. One form of construction of printhead wafer will now be discussed with reference to which illustrates an exploded perspective view of a single ink jet nozzle constructed in accordance with a preferred embodiment.

1 Starting with a single crystal silicon wafer which has a buried epitaxial layer of silicon which is heavily doped with boron. The boron should be doped to preferably 10atoms per cmof boron or more and be approximately 3 micron thick. The lightly doped silicon epitaxial layer on top of the boron doped layer should be approximately 8 micron thick and be doped in a manner suitable for the active semiconductor device technology chosen. This is the printhead wafer. The wafer diameter should preferably be the same as the ink channel wafer.

2 The drive transistors and data distribution circuitry layer is fabricated according to the process chosen up until the oxide layer over second level metal.

4 Next the actuator is constructed. The actuator comprises one copper layer embedded in a PTFE layer . The copper layer comprises both the heater element and planar portion of . Turning now to the corrugated resistive element can be formed by depositing a resist layer on top of the first PTFE layer . The resist layer is exposed utilizing a mask having a half tone pattern delineating the corrugations. After development the resist contains the corrugation pattern. The resist layer and the PTFE layer are then etched utilizing an etchant that erodes the resist layer at substantially the same rate as the PTFE layer . This transfers the corrugated pattern into the PTFE layer . Turning to on top of the corrugated PTFE layer is deposited the copper heater layer which takes on a corrugated form in accordance with its under layer. The copper heater layer is then etched in a serpentine or concertina form. In there is illustrated a top view of the copper layer only comprising the serpentine heater element and the portion . Subsequently a further PTFE layer is deposited on top of layer so as to form the top layer of the thermal actuator . Finally the second PTFE layer is planarized to form the top surface of the thermal actuator .

5 Etch through the PTFE and all the way down to silicon in the region around the three sides of the paddle. The etched region should be etched on all previous lithographic steps so that the etch to silicon does not require strong selectivity against PTFE.

6 Etch the wafers in an anisotropic wet etch which stops on crystallographic planes or on heavily boron doped silicon. The etch can be a batch wet etch in ethylenediamine pyrocatechol EDP . The etch proceeds until the paddles are entirely undercut thereby forming the nozzle chamber . The backside of the wafer need not be protected against this etch as the wafer is to be subsequently thinned. Approximately 60 micron of silicon will be etched from the wafer backside during this process.

7 Permanently bond the printhead wafer onto a pre fabricated ink channel wafer. The active side of the printhead wafer faces the ink channel wafer. The ink channel wafer is attached to a backing plate as it has already been etched into separate ink channel chips.

8 Etch the printhead wafer to entirely remove the backside silicon to the level of the boron doped epitaxial layer . This etch can be a batch wet etch in ethylenediamine pyrocatechol EDP .

9 Mask an ejection port rim from the underside of the print head wafer. This mask is a series of circles approximately 0.5 micron to 1 micron larger in radius than the nozzles. The purpose of this step is to leave a raised rim around the ejection port to help prevent ink spreading on the front surface of the wafer. This step can be eliminated if the front surface is made sufficiently hydrophobic to reliably prevent front surface wetting.

11 Mask the ejection ports from the underside of the printhead wafer. This mask can also include the chip edges.

13 Separate the chips from their backing plate. Each chip is now a full printhead including ink channels. The two wafers have already been etched through so the printheads do not need to be diced.

It would be evident to persons skilled in the relevant arts that the arrangement described by way of example in a preferred embodiments will result in a nozzle arrangement able to eject ink on demand and be suitable for incorporation in a drop on demand ink jet printer device having an array of nozzles for the ejection of ink on demand.

Of course alternative embodiments will also be self evident to the person skilled in the art. For example the thermal actuator could be operated in a reverse mode wherein passing current through the actuator results in movement of the actuator to an ink loading position when the subsequent cooling of the paddle results in the ink being ejected. However this has a number of disadvantages in that cooling is likely to take a substantially longer time than heating and this arrangement would require a constant current to be passed through the nozzle arrangement when not in use.

One form of detailed manufacturing process which can be used to fabricate monolithic ink jet printheads operating in accordance with the principles taught by the present embodiment can proceed utilizing the following steps 

1. Using a double sided polished wafer deposit 3 microns of epitaxial silicon heavily doped with boron .

2. Deposit 10 microns of epitaxial silicon either p type or n type depending upon the CMOS process used.

3. Complete drive transistors data distribution and timing circuits using a 0.5 micron one poly 2 metal CMOS process . This step is shown in .

4. Etch the CMOS oxide layers down to silicon or aluminum using Mask 1. This mask defines the nozzle chamber and the edges of the printheads chips. This step is shown in .

5. Crystallographically etch the exposed silicon using for example KOH or EDP ethylenediamine pyrocatechol . This etch stops on crystallographic planes and on the boron doped silicon buried layer. This step is shown in .

7. Deposit 12 microns of sacrificial material polyimide . Planarize down to nitride using CMP. The sacrificial material temporarily fills the nozzle cavity. This step is shown in .

9. Deposit expose and develop 1 micron of resist using Mask 2. This mask is a gray scale mask which defines the heater vias as well as the corrugated PTFE surface that the heater is subsequently deposited on.

10. Etch the PTFE and resist at substantially the same rate. The corrugated resist thickness is transferred to the PTFE and the PTFE is completely etched in the heater via positions. In the corrugated regions the resultant PTFE thickness nominally varies between 0.25 micron and 0.75 micron though exact values are not critical. This step is shown in .

11. Etch the nitride and CMOS passivation down to second level metal using the resist and PTFE as a mask.

13. Deposit 0.5 microns of gold or other heater material with a low Young s modulus and strip the resist. Steps 11 and 12 form a lift off process. This step is shown in .

15. Etch the PTFE down to the nitride or sacrificial layer using Mask 4. This mask defines the actuator and the bond pads. This step is shown in .

16. Wafer probe. All electrical connections are complete at this point and the chips are not yet separated.

17. Plasma process the PTFE to make the top and side surfaces of the paddle hydrophilic. This allows the nozzle chamber to fill by capillarity.

18. Mount the wafer on a glass blank and back etch the wafer using KOH with no mask. This etch thins the wafer and stops at the buried boron doped silicon layer. This step is shown in .

19. Plasma back etch the boron doped silicon layer to a depth of 1 micron using Mask 5. This mask defines the nozzle rim . This step is shown in .

20. Plasma back etch through the boron doped layer and sacrificial layer using Mask 6. This mask defines the nozzle and the edge of the chips. At this stage the chips are still mounted on the glass blank. This step is shown in .

23. Strip the adhesive layer to detach the chips from the glass blank. This process completely separates the chips. This step is shown in .

24. Mount the printheads in their packaging which may be a molded plastic former incorporating ink channels which supply different colors of ink to the appropriate regions of the front surface of the wafer.

In a preferred embodiment an inkjet nozzle is provided having a thermally based actuator which is highly energy efficient. The thermal actuator is located within a chamber filled with ink and relies upon the thermal expansion of materials when an electric current is being passed through them to activate the actuator thereby causing the ejection of ink out of a nozzle provided in the nozzle chamber.

Turning to the Figures in there are illustrated two adjoining inkjet nozzles constructed in accordance with a preferred embodiment with showing an exploded perspective and showing various sectional views. Each nozzle can be constructed as part of an array of nozzles on a silicon wafer device and can be constructed utilizing semiconductor processing techniques in addition to micro machining and micro fabrication process technology MEMS and a full familiarity with these technologies is hereinafter assumed.

A nozzle chamber includes a ink ejection port for the ejection of ink from within the nozzle chamber Ink is supplied via an inlet port which has a grill structure fabricated from a series of posts the grill acting to filter out foreign bodies within the ink supply and also to provide stability to the nozzle chamber structure. Inside the nozzle chamber is constructed a thermal actuator device which is interconnected to an electric circuit not shown which when thermally actuated acts as a paddle bending upwards so as to cause the ejection of ink from each ink ejection port . A series of etchant holes e.g. are also provided in the top of nozzle chamber the holes being provided for manufacturing purposes only so to allow a sacrificial etchant to easily etch away the internal portions of nozzle chamber . The etchant ports are of a sufficiently small diameter so that the resulting surface tension holds the ink within chamber such that no ink leaks out via ports .

The thermal actuator is composed primarily of polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE which is a generally hydrophobic material. The top layer of the actuator is treated or coated so as to make it hydrophilic and thereby attract water ink via inlet port . Suitable treatments include plasma exposure in an ammonia atmosphere. The bottom surface remains hydrophobic and repels the water from the underneath surface of the actuator . Underneath the actuator is provided a further surface also composed of a hydrophobic material such as PTFE. The surface has a series of holes in it which allow for the flow of air into the nozzle chamber . The diameter of the nozzle holes again being of such a size so as to restrict the flow of fluid out of the nozzle chamber via surface tension interactions. out of the nozzle chamber.

The surface is separated from a lower level by means of a series of spaced apart posts e.g. which can be constructed when constructing the layer utilizing an appropriate mask. The nozzle chamber but for grill inlet port is walled on its sides by silicon nitride walls e.g. . An air inlet port is formed between adjacent nozzle chambers such that air is free to flow between the walls . Hence air is able to flow down channel and along channel and through holes e.g. in accordance with any fluctuating pressure influences.

The air flow acts to reduce the vacuum on the back surface of actuator during operation. As a result less energy is required for the movement of the actuator . In operation the actuator is thermally actuated so as to move upwards and cause ink ejection. As a result air flows in along channels and through the holes e.g. into the bottom area of actuator . Upon deactivation of the actuator the actuator lowers with a corresponding airflow out of port along channel and out of channel . Any fluid within nozzle chamber is firstly repelled by the hydrophobic nature of the bottom side of the surface of actuator in addition to the top of the surface which is again hydrophobic. As noted previously the limited size holes e.g. further stop the fluid from passing the holes as a result of surface tension characteristics.

A further preferable feature of nozzle chamber is the utilisation of the nitride posts to also clamp one end of the surfaces and firmly to bottom surface thereby reducing the likelihood delaminating during operation.

In there is illustrated an exploded perspective view of a single nozzle . The exploded perspective view illustrates the form of construction of each layer of a simple nozzle . The nozzle arrangement can be constructed on a base silicon wafer having a top glass layer which includes the various drive and control circuitry and which for example can comprise a two level metal CMOS layer with the various interconnects not shown . On top of the layer is first laid out a nitride passivation layer of approximately one micron thickness which includes a number of vias not shown for the interconnection of the subsequent layers to the CMOS layer . The nitride layer is provided primarily to protect lower layers from corrosion or etching especially where sacrificial etchants are utilized. Next a one micron PTFE layer is constructed having the aforementioned holes e.g. and posts . The structure of the PTFE layer can be formed by first laying down a sacrificial glass layer not shown onto which the PTFE layer is deposited. The PTFE layer includes various features for example a lower ridge portion in addition to a hole which acts as a via for the subsequent material layers.

The actuator proper is formed from two PTFE layers . The lower PTFE layer is made conductive. The PTFE layer can be made conductive utilizing a number of different techniques including 

 ii Embedding within the PTFE layer a series of quantum wires constructed from such a material as carbon nanotubes created in a mesh form. Individual single wall carbon nano tubes as quantum wires by Tans et al Nature Volume 386 3rd Apr. 1997 at pages 474 477 . The PTFE layer includes certain cut out portions e.g. so that a complete circuit is formed around the PTFE actuator . The cut out portions can be optimised so as to regulate the resistive heating of the layer by means of providing constricted portions so as to thereby increase the heat generated in various hot spots as required. A space is provided between the PTFE layer and the PTFE layer through the utilisation of an intermediate sacrificial glass layer not shown .

On top of the PTFE layer is deposited a second PTFE layer which can be a standard non conductive PTFE layer and can include filling in those areas in the lower PTFE layer e.g. which are not conductive. The top of the PTFE layer is further treated or coated to make it hydrophilic.

Next a nitride layer can be deposited to form the nozzle chamber proper. The nitride layer can be formed by first laying down a sacrificial glass layer and etching the glass layer to form walls e.g. and grilled portion e.g. . Preferably the mask utilized results a first anchor portion which mates with the hole in layer so as to fix the layer to the nitride layer . Additionally the bottom surface of the grill meets with a corresponding step See in the PTFE layer so as to clamp the end portion of the PTFE layers and to the wafer surface so as to guard against delamination. Next a top nitride layer can be formed having a number of holes e.g. and nozzle hole around which a rim can be etched through etching of the nitride layer . Subsequently the various sacrificial layers can be etched away so as to release the structure of the thermal actuator.

Obviously large arrays of inkjet nozzles can be created side by side on a single wafer. The ink can be supplied via ink channels etched through the wafer utilizing a high density low pressure plasma etching system such as that supplied by Surface Technology Systems of the United Kingdom.

The foregoing describes only one embodiment of the invention and many variations of the embodiment will be obvious for a person skilled in the art of semi conductor micro mechanical fabrication. Certainly various other materials can be utilized in the construction of the various layers.

One form of detailed manufacturing process which can be used to fabricate monolithic ink jet printheads operating in accordance with the principles taught by the present embodiment can proceed utilizing the following steps 

1. Using a double sided polished wafer complete drive transistors data distribution and timing circuits using a 0.5 micron one poly 2 metal CMOS process .

9. Deposit 1 micron of conductive PTFE . Conductive PTFE can be formed by doping the PTFE with a conductive material such as extremely fine metal or graphitic filaments or fine metal particles and so forth. The PTFE should be doped so that the resistance of the PTFE conductive heater is sufficiently low so that the correct amount of power is dissipated by the heater when the drive voltage is applied. However the conductive material should be a small percentage of the PTFE volume so that the coefficient of thermal expansion is not significantly reduced. Carbon nanotubes can provide significant conductivity at low concentrations. This step is shown in .

20. Back etch completely through the silicon wafer with for example an ASE Advanced Silicon Etcher from Surface Technology Systems using Mask 9. This mask defines the ink inlets which are etched through the wafer. The wafer is also diced by this etch. This step is shown in .

21. Back etch the CMOS oxide layers and subsequently deposited nitride layers through to the sacrificial layer using the back etched silicon as a mask.

22. Etch the sacrificial material. The nozzle chambers are cleared the actuators freed and the chips are separated by this etch. This step is shown in .

23. Mount the printheads in their packaging which may be a molded plastic former incorporating ink channels which supply the appropriate color ink to the ink inlets at the back of the wafer.

24. Connect the printheads to their interconnect systems. For a low profile connection with minimum disruption of airflow TAB may be used. Wire bonding may also be used if the printer is to be operated with sufficient clearance to the paper.

In a preferred embodiment there is provided a nozzle chamber having an ink ejection port and a magnetostrictive actuator surrounded by an electrical coil such that upon activation of the coil a magnetic field is produced which affects the actuator to the extent that it causes the ejection of ink from the nozzle chamber.

Turning now to there is illustrated a perspective cross sectional view of a single ink jet nozzle arrangement . The nozzle arrangement includes a nozzle chamber which opens to a nozzle ejection port for the ejection of ink.

The nozzle can be formed on a large silicon wafer with multiple printheads being formed from nozzle groups at the same time. The ejection port can be formed from back etching the silicon wafer to the level of a boron doped epitaxial layer which is subsequently etched using an appropriate mask to form the nozzle portal including a rim . The nozzle chamber is further formed from a crystallographic etch of the remaining portions of the silicon wafer the crystallographic etching process being well known in the field of micro electro mechanical systems MEMS .

Turning now to there is illustrated an exploded perspective view illustrating the construction of a single ink jet nozzle arrangement in accordance with a preferred embodiment.

On top of the silicon wafer there is previously constructed a two level metal CMOS layer which includes an aluminum layer not shown . The CMOS layer is constructed to provide data and control circuitry for the ink jet nozzle . On top of the CMOS layer is constructed a nitride passivation layer which includes nitride paddle portion . The nitride layer can be constructed by using a sacrificial material such as glass to first fill the crystallographic etched nozzle chamber then depositing the nitride layer before etching the sacrificial layer away to release the nitride layer . On top of the nitride layer is formed a Terfenol D layer . Terfenol D is a material having high magnetostrictive properties for further information on the properties of Terfenol D reference is made to magnetostriction theory and applications of magnetoelasticity by Etienne du Tr molett de Lachiesserie published 1993 by CRC Press . Upon it being subject to a magnetic field the Terfenol D substance expands. The Terfenol D layer is attached to a lower nitride layer which does not undergo expansion. As a result the forces are resolved by a bending of the nitride layer towards the nozzle ejection hole thereby causing the ejection of ink from the ink ejection portal .

The Terfenol D layer is passivated by a top nitride layer on top of which is a copper coil layer which is interconnected to the lower CMOS layer via a series of vias so that copper coil layer can be activated upon demand. The activation of the copper coil layer induces a magnetic field across the Terfenol D layer thereby causing the Terfenol D layer to undergo phase change on demand. Therefore in order to eject ink from the nozzle chamber the Terfenol D layer is activated to undergo phase change causing the bending of actuator in the direction of the ink ejection port thereby causing the ejection of ink drops. Upon deactivation of the upper coil layer the actuator returns to its quiescent position drawing some of the ink back into the nozzle chamber causing an ink ligament connecting the ink drop to the ink in the nozzle chamber to thin. The forward velocity of the drop and backward velocity of the ink in the nozzle chamber are resolved by the ink drop breaking off from the ink in the nozzle chamber . Ink refill of the nozzle chamber is via the sides of actuator as a result of the surface tension of the ink meniscus at the ejection port .

The copper layer is passivated by a nitride layer not shown and the nozzle arrangement abuts an ink supply reservoir .

A method of ejecting ink from the nozzle chamber comprises providing the actuator formed of magnetostrictive material as a wall of the chamber and then effecting a phase transformation of the magnetostrictive material in the magnetic field by activating the copper coil layer or vice versa . This in turn causes the ejection of ink from nozzle chamber via ejection port .

The actuator comprises a magnetostrictive paddle which transfers from the quiescent state as shown in to an ink ejection state upon application of the magnetic field. The actuator moves downwardly in the direction of the arrow shown in toward the ejection port .

The magnetic field is applied by passing a current through the copper coil layer adjacent to the actuator .

The actuator as shown in forms one wall of the chamber opposite the ink ejection port from which ink is ejected.

The ink ejection port is formed by back etching a silicon wafer to an epitaxial layer and etching a nozzle portal in the epitaxial layer. The crystallographic etch provides side wall slots of non etched layers of a processed silicon wafer so as to extend dimensionally chamber as a result of the crystallographic etch process. As a result side walls of the chamber as shown in have an upwardly outwardly tapered profile.

In a preferred embodiment shape memory materials are utilized to construct an actuator suitable for injecting ink from the nozzle of an ink chamber.

Turning to there is illustrated an exploded perspective view of a single ink jet nozzle as constructed in accordance with a preferred embodiment. The ink jet nozzle is constructed from a silicon wafer base utilizing back etching of the wafer to a boron doped epitaxial layer. Hence the ink jet nozzle comprises a lower layer which is constructed from boron doped silicon. The boron doped silicon layer is also utilized a crystallographic etch stop layer. The next layer comprises the silicon layer that includes a crystallographic pit having side walls etch at the usual angle of 54.74 degrees. The layer also includes the various required circuitry and transistors for example CMOS layer not shown . After this a 0.5 micron thick thermal silicon oxide layer is grown on top of the silicon wafer .

After this comes various layers which can comprise a two level metal CMOS process layers which provide the metal interconnect for the CMOS transistors formed within the layer . The various metal pathways etc. are not shown in but for two metal interconnects which provide interconnection between a shape memory alloy layer and the CMOS metal layers . The shape memory metal layer is next and is shaped in the form of a serpentine coil to be heated by end interconnect via portions . A top nitride layer is provided for overall passivation and protection of lower layers in addition to providing a means of inducing tensile stress to curl upwards the shape memory alloy layer in its quiescent state.

A preferred embodiment relies upon the thermal transition of a shape memory alloy SMA from its martensitic phase to its austenitic phase. The basis of a shape memory effect is a martensitic transformation which creates a polydemane phase upon cooling. This polydemane phase accommodates finite reversible mechanical deformations without significant changes in the mechanical self energy of the system. Hence upon re transformation to the austenitic state the system returns to its former macroscopic state to displaying the well known mechanical memory. The thermal transition is achieved by passing an electrical current through the SMA. The actuator layer is suspended at the entrance to a nozzle chamber connected via leads to the lower layers.

In there is shown a cross section of a single nozzle when in its actuated state the section basically being taken through the line A A of . The actuator is bent away from the nozzle when in its actuated state. In there is shown a corresponding cross section for a single nozzle when in a quiescent state. When energized the actuator straightens with the corresponding result that the ink is pushed out of the nozzle. The process of energizing the actuator requires supplying enough energy to raise the SMA above its transition temperature and to provide the latent heat of transformation to the SMA 2620.

Obviously the SMA martensitic phase must be pre stressed to achieve a different shape from the austenitic phase. For printheads with many thousands of nozzles it is important to achieve this pre stressing in a bulk manner. This is achieved by depositing the layer of silicon nitride using Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapour Deposition PECVD at around 300 C. over the SMA layer. The deposition occurs while the SMA is in the austenitic shape. After the printhead cools to room temperature the substrate under the SMA bend actuator is removed by chemical etching of a sacrificial substance. The silicon nitride layer is under tensile stress and causes the actuator to curl upwards. The weak martensitic phase of the SMA provides little resistance to this curl. When the SMA is heated to its austenitic phase it returns to the flat shape into which it was annealed during the nitride deposition. The transformation being rapid enough to result in the ejection of ink from the nozzle chamber.

There is one SMA bend actuator for each nozzle. One end of the SMA bend actuator is mechanically connected to the substrate. The other end is free to move under the stresses inherent in the layers.

1. An SiOlower layer . This layer acts as a stress reference for the nitride tensile layer. It also protects the SMA from the crystallographic silicon etch that forms the nozzle chamber. This layer can be formed as part of the standard CMOS process for the active electronics of the printhead.

2. A SMA heater layer . A SMA such as nickel titanium NiTi alloy is deposited and etched into a serpentine form to increase the electrical resistance.

3. A silicon nitride top layer . This is a thin layer of high stiffness which is deposited using PECVD. The nitride stoichiometry is adjusted to achieve a layer with significant tensile stress at room temperature relative to the SiOlower layer. Its purpose is to bend the actuator at the low temperature martensitic phase.

As noted previously the ink jet nozzle of can be constructed by utilizing a silicon wafer having a buried boron epitaxial layer. The 0.5 micron thick dioxide layer is then formed having side slots which are utilized in a subsequent crystallographic etch. Next the various CMOS layers are formed including drive and control circuitry not shown . The SMA layer is then created on top of layers and being interconnected with the drive circuitry. Subsequently a silicon nitride layer is formed on top. Each of the layers include the various slots e.g. which are utilized in a subsequent crystallographic etch. The silicon wafer is subsequently thinned by means of back etching with the etch stop being the boron layer . Subsequent boron etching forms the nozzle hole e.g. and rim . Subsequently the chamber proper is formed by means of a crystallographic etch with the slots defining the extent of the etch within the silicon oxide layer .

A large array of nozzles can be formed on the same wafer which in turn is attached to an ink chamber for filling the nozzle chambers.

One form of detailed manufacturing process which can be used to fabricate monolithic ink jet printheads operating in accordance with the principles taught by the present embodiment can proceed utilizing the following steps 

1. Using a double sided polished wafer deposit 3 microns of epitaxial silicon heavily doped with boron .

2. Deposit 10 microns of epitaxial silicon either p type or n type depending upon the CMOS process used.

3. Complete drive transistors data distribution and timing circuits using a 0.5 micron one poly 2 metal CMOS process . This step is shown in . For clarity these diagrams may not be to scale and may not represent a cross section though any single plane of the nozzle. is a key to representations of various materials in these manufacturing diagrams and those of other cross referenced ink jet configurations.

4. Etch the CMOS oxide layers down to silicon or aluminum using Mask 1. This mask defines the nozzle chamber and the edges of the printheads chips. This step is shown in .

5. Crystallographically etch the exposed silicon using for example KOH or EDP ethylenediamine pyrocatechol . This etch stops on crystallographic planes and on the boron doped silicon buried layer. This step is shown in .

6. Deposit 12 microns of sacrificial material . Planarize down to oxide using CMP. The sacrificial material temporarily fills the nozzle cavity. This step is shown in .

8. Etch the nitride layer using Mask 2. This mask defines the contact vias from the shape memory heater to the second level metal contacts.

10. Spin on 2 microns of resist expose with Mask 3 and develop. This mask defines the shape memory wire embedded in the paddle. The resist acts as an electroplating mold. This step is shown in .

11. Electroplate 1 micron of Nitinol . Nitinol is a shape memory alloy of nickel and titanium developed at the Naval Ordnance Laboratory in the US hence Ni Ti NOL . A shape memory alloy can be thermally switched between its weak martensitic state and its high stiffness austenic state.

13. Wafer probe. All electrical connections are complete at this point bond pads are accessible and the chips are not yet separated.

14. Deposit 0.1 microns of high stress silicon nitride. High stress nitride is used so that once the sacrificial material is etched and the paddle is released the stress in the nitride layer will bend the relatively weak martensitic phase of the shape memory alloy. As the shape memory alloy in its austenic phase is flat when it is annealed by the relatively high temperature deposition of this silicon nitride layer it will return to this flat state when electrothermally heated.

15. Mount the wafer on a glass blank and back etch the wafer using KOH with no mask. This etch thins the wafer and stops at the buried boron doped silicon layer. This step is shown in .

16. Plasma back etch the boron doped silicon layer to a depth of 1 micron using Mask 4. This mask defines the nozzle rim . This step is shown in .

17. Plasma back etch through the boron doped layer using Mask 5. This mask defines the nozzle and the edge of the chips. At this stage the chips are still mounted on the glass blank. This step is shown in .

18. Strip the adhesive layer to detach the chips from the glass blank. Etch the sacrificial layer. This process completely separates the chips. This step is shown in .

19. Mount the printheads in their packaging which may be a molded plastic former incorporating ink channels which supply different colors of ink to the appropriate regions of the front surface of the wafer.

In a preferred embodiment a roof shooting ink jet printhead is constructed utilizing a buckle plate actuator for the ejection of ink. In a preferred embodiment the buckle plate actuator is constructed from polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE which provides superior thermal expansion characteristics. The PTFE is heated by an integral serpentine shaped heater which preferably is constructed from a resistive material such as copper.

Turning now to there is shown a sectional perspective view of an ink jet printhead of a preferred embodiment. The ink jet printhead includes a nozzle chamber in which ink is stored to be ejected. The chamber can be independently connected to an ink supply not shown for the supply and refilling of the chamber. At the base of the chamber is a buckle plate which comprises a heater element which can be of an electrically resistive material such as copper. The heater element is encased in a polytetrafluoroethylene layer . The utilization of the PTFE layer allows for high rates of thermal expansion and therefore more effective operation of the buckle plate . PTFE has a high coefficient of thermal expansion 770 10 with the copper having a much lower degree of thermal expansion. The copper heater element is therefore fabricated in a serpentine pattern so as to allow the expansion of the PTFE layer to proceed unhindered. The serpentine fabrication of the heater element means that the two coefficients of thermal expansion of the PTFE and the heater material need not be closely matched. The PTFE is primarily chosen for its high thermal expansion properties.

Current can be supplied to the buckle plate by means of connectors which inter connect the buckle plate with a lower drive circuitry and logic layer . Hence to operate the ink jet head the heater coil is energized thereby heating the PTFE . The PTFE expands and buckles between end portions . The buckle causes initial ejection of ink out of a nozzle located at the top of the nozzle chamber . There is an air bubble between the buckle plate and the adjacent wall of the chamber which forms due to the hydrophobic nature of the PTFE on the back surface of the buckle plate . An air vent connects the air bubble to the ambient air through a channel formed between a nitride layer and an additional PTFE layer separated by posts e.g. and through holes e.g. in the PTFE layer . The air vent allows the buckle plate to move without being held back by a reduction in air pressure as the buckle plate expands. Subsequently power is turned off to the buckle plate resulting in a collapse of the buckle plate and the sucking back of some of the ejected ink. The forward motion of the ejected ink and the sucking back is resolved by an ink drop breaking off from the main volume of ink and continuing onto a page Ink refill is then achieved by surface tension effects across the nozzle part and a resultant inflow of ink into the nozzle chamber through the grilled supply channel .

It has been found in simulations of a preferred embodiment that the utilization of the PTFE layer and serpentine heater arrangement allows for a substantial reduction in energy requirements of operation in addition to a more compact design.

Turning now to there is provided an exploded perspective view partly in section illustrating the construction of a single ink jet nozzle in accordance with a preferred embodiment. The nozzle arrangement is fabricated on top of a silicon wafer . The nozzle arrangement can be constructed on the silicon wafer utilizing standard semi conductor processing techniques in addition to those techniques commonly used for the construction of micro electro mechanical systems MEMS .

On top of the silicon layer is deposited a two level CMOS circuitry layer which substantially comprises glass in addition to the usual metal layers. Next a nitride layer is deposited to protect and passivate the underlying layer . The nitride layer also includes vias for the interconnection of the heater element to the CMOS layer . Next a PTFE layer is constructed having the aforementioned holes e.g. and posts e.g. . The structure of the PTFE layer can be formed by first laying down a sacrificial glass layer not shown onto which the PTFE layer is deposited. The PTFE layer includes various features for example a lower ridge portion in addition to a hole which acts as a via for the subsequent material layers. The buckle plate comprises a conductive layer and a PTFE layer . A first thicker PTFE layer is deposited onto a sacrificial layer not shown . Next a conductive layer is deposited including contacts . The conductive layer is then etched to form a serpentine pattern. Next a thinner second PTFE layer is deposited to complete the buckle plate structure.

Finally a nitride layer can be deposited to form the nozzle chamber proper. The nitride layer can be formed by first laying down a sacrificial glass layer and etching this to form walls e.g. and grilled portions e.g. . Preferably the mask utilized results in a first anchor portion which mates with the hole in layer . Additionally the bottom surface of the grill for example meets with a corresponding step in the PTFE layer . Next a top nitride layer can be formed having a number of holes e.g. and nozzle port around which a rim can be etched through etching of the nitride layer . Subsequently the various sacrificial layers can be etched away so as to release the structure of the thermal actuator and the air vent channel .

In a preferred embodiment a thermal actuator is utilized to activate a set of vanes so as to compress a volume of ink and thereby force ink out of an ink nozzle.

Turning to there is illustrated an exploded perspective view of a single inkjet nozzle . A preferred embodiment fundamentally comprises a series of vane chambers which are normally filled with ink. The vane chambers include side walls which define static vanes each having a first radial wall and a second circumferential wall . A set of impeller vanes is also provided which each have a radially aligned surface and are attached to rings with the inner ring being pivotally mounted around a pivot unit . The outer ring is also rotatable about the pivot point and is interconnected with thermal actuators . The thermal actuators are of a circumferential form and undergo expansion and contraction thereby rotating the impeller vanes towards the radial wall of the static vanes . As a consequence the vane chamber undergoes a rapid reduction in volume thereby resulting in a substantial increase in pressure resulting in the expulsion of ink from the chamber .

The static vane is attached to a nozzle plate . The nozzle plate includes a nozzle rim defining an aperture into the vane chambers . The aperture defined by rim allows for the injection of ink from the vane chambers onto the relevant print media.

Turning now to there is illustrated a cross sectional view through a single nozzle arrangement. The illustration of shows a drop being ejected out of the nozzle aperture as a result of displacement of the impeller vanes . The nozzle arrangement is constructed on a silicon wafer . Electronic drive circuitry is first constructed for control and driving of the thermal actuators . A silicon dioxide layer is provided for defining the nozzle chamber which includes channel walls separating ink of one color from an adjacent ink reservoirs not shown . The nozzle plate is also interconnected to the wafer via nozzle plate posts so as to provide for stable separation from the wafer . The static vanes are constructed from silicon nitrate as is the nozzle plate . The static vanes and nozzle plate can be constructed utilizing a dual damascene process utilizing a sacrificial layer as discussed further hereinafter.

In a preferred embodiment a new form of thermal actuator is utilized for the ejection of drops of ink on demand from an ink nozzle. Turning now to there will be illustrated the basis of operation of the inkjet printing device utilizing the actuator. Turning initially to there is illustrated the quiescent position of a thermal actuator in a nozzle chamber filled with ink and having a nozzle for the ejection of ink. The nozzle has an ink meniscus in a state of surface tension ready for the ejection of ink. The thermal actuator is coated on a first surface facing the chamber with a hydrophilic material. A second surface is coated with a hydrophobic material which causes an air bubble having a meniscus underneath the actuator . The air bubble is formed over time by outgassing from the ink within chamber and the meniscus is shown in an equilibrium position between the hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces. The actuator is fixed at one end to a substrate from which it also derives an electrical connection.

When it is desired to eject a drop from the nozzle the actuator is activated as shown in resulting in a movement in direction the movement in direction causes a substantial increase in the pressure of the ink around the nozzle . This results in a general expansion of the meniscus and the passing of momentum to the ink so as to form a partial drop . Upon movement of the actuator in the direction the ink meniscus collapses generally in the indicated direction .

Subsequently the thermal actuator is deactivated as illustrated in resulting in a return of the actuator in the direction generally indicated by the arrow . The movement back of the actuator results in a low pressure region being experienced by the ink within the nozzle area . The forward momentum of the drop and the low pressure around the nozzle results in the ink drop being broken off from the main body of the ink. The drop continues to the print media as required. The movement of the actuator in the direction further causes ink to flow in the direction around the actuator in addition to causing the meniscus to move as a result of the ink flow . Further further ink is sucked into the chamber to refill the ejected ink .

Finally as illustrated in the actuator returns to its quiescent position with the meniscus also returning to a state of having a slight bulge. The actuator is then in a state for refiring of another drop on demand as required.

In one form of implementation of an inkjet printer utilizing the method illustrated in standard semi conductive fabrication techniques are utilized in addition to standard micro electro mechanical MEMS techniques construct a suitable print device having a polarity of the chambers as illustrated in with corresponding actuators .

Turning now to there is illustrated a cross section through one form of suitable nozzle chamber. A group of such ink jet nozzles is shown in . One end of the actuator is connected to the substrate and the other end includes a stiff paddle for use in ejecting ink. The actuator itself is constructed from a four layer MEMS processing technique. The layers are as follows 

1. A polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE lower layer . PTFE has a very high coefficient of thermal expansion approximately 770 10 or around 380 times that of silicon . This layer expands when heated by a heater layer.

2. A heater layer . A serpentine heater is etched in this layer which may be formed from nichrome copper or other suitable material with a resistivity such that the drive voltage for the heater is compatible with the drive transistors utilized. The serpentine heater is arranged to have very little tensile strength in the direction along the length of the actuator.

4. A silicon nitride layer . This is a thin layer is of high stiffness and low coefficient of thermal expansion. Its purpose is to ensure that the actuator bends instead of simply elongating as a result of thermal expansion of the PTFE layers. Silicon nitride can be used simply because it is a standard semi conductor material and SiOcannot easily be used if it is also the sacrificial material used when constructing the device.

1. When data signals distributed on the print head indicate that a particular nozzle is to eject a drop of ink the drive transistor for that nozzle is turned on. This energises the heater in the paddle for that nozzle. The heater is energised for approximately 2 microseconds with the actual duration depending upon the exact design chosen for the actuator nozzle and the inks utilized.

2. The heater heats the PTFE layers which expand at a rate many times that of the SiNlayer . This expansion causes the actuator to bend with the PTFE layer being the convex side. The bending of the actuator moves the paddle pushing ink out of the nozzle. The air bubble between the paddle and the substrate forms due to the hydrophobic nature of the PTFE on the back surface of the paddle. This air bubble reduces the thermal coupling to the hot side of the actuator achieving a higher temperature with lower power. The cold side of the actuator including SiN layer will still be water cooled. The air bubble will also expand slightly when heated helping to move the paddle. The presence of the air bubble also means that less ink is required to move under the paddle when the actuator is energised. These three factors lead to a lower power consumption of the actuator.

3. When the heater current is turned off as noted previously the paddle begins to return to its quiescent position. The paddle return sucks some of the ink back into the nozzle causing the ink ligament connecting the ink drop to the ink in the nozzle to thin. The forward velocity of the drop and the backward velocity of the ink in the chamber are resolved by the ink drop breaking off from the ink in the nozzle. The ink drop then continues towards the recording medium.

One form of print head fabrication sequence utilizing MEMS technology will now be described. The description assumes that the reader is familiar with surface and micromachining techniques utilized for the construction of MEMS devices including the latest proceedings in these areas. Turning now to there is illustrated an exploded perspective view of a single ink jet nozzle as constructed in accordance with a preferred embodiment. The construction of a print head can proceed as follows 

1. Start with a standard single crystal silicon wafer suitable for the desired manufacturing process of the active semiconductor device technology chosen. Here the manufacturing process is assumed to be 0.5 microns CMOS.

2. Complete fabrication the CMOS circuitry layer including an oxide layer not shown and passivation layer for passivation of the wafer. As the chip will be immersed in water based ink the passivation layer must be highly impervious. A layer of high density silicon nitride SiN is suitable. Another alternative is diamond like carbon DLC .

3. Deposit 2 micron of phosphosilicate glass PSG . This will be a sacrificial layer which raises the actuator and paddle from the substrate. This thickness is not critical.

5. Deposit 1.0 micron of polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE layer . The PTFE may be roughened to promote adhesion. The PTFE may be deposited as a spin on nanoemulsion. T. Rosenmayer H. Wu PTFE nanoemulsions as spin on low dielectric constant materials for VLSI applications PP463 468 Advanced Metallisation for Future VLSI MRS vol. 427 1996 .

6. Mask and etch via holes through to the top level metal of the CMOS circuitry for connection of a power supply to the actuator not shown . Suitable etching procedures for PTFE are discussed in Thermally assisted Ian Beam Etching of polytetrafluoroethylene A new technique for High Aspect Ratio Etching of MEMS by Berenschot et al in the Proceedings of the Ninth Annual International Workshop on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems San Diego February 1996.

7. Deposit the heater material layer . This may be Nichrome an alloy of 80 nickel and 20 chromium which may be deposited by sputtering. Many other heater materials may be used. The principal requirements are a resistivity which results in a drive voltage which is suitable for the CMOS drive circuitry layer a melting point above the temperature of subsequent process steps electromigration resistance and appropriate mechanical properties.

9. Deposit 2.0 micron of PTFE. As with step 5 the PTFE may be spun on as a nanoemulsion and may be roughened to promote adhesion. This layer forms part of layer in . 

10. Deposit via a mask 0.25 of silicon nitride for the top of the layer of the actuator or any of a wide variety of other materials having suitable properties as previously described. The major materials requirements are a low coefficient of thermal expansion compared to PTFE a relatively high Young s modulus does not corrode in water and a low etch rate in hydrofluoric acid HF . The last of these requirements is due to the subsequent use of HF to etch the sacrificial glass layers. If a different sacrificial layer is chosen then this layer should obviously have resistance to the process used to remove the sacrificial material.

11. Using the silicon nitride as a mask etch the PTFE PTFE can be etched with very high selectivity 1 000 to one with ion beam etching. The wafer may be tilted slightly and rotated during etching to prevent the formation of microglass. Both layers of PTFE can be etched simultaneously.

12. Deposit 20 micron of SiO. This may be deposited as spin on glass SOG and will be used as a sacrificial layer not shown .

13. Etch through the glass layer using a mask defining the nozzle chamber and ink channel walls e.g. and filter posts e.g. . This etch is through around 20 micron of glass so should be highly anisotropic to minimise the chip area required. The minimum line width is around 6 microns so coarse lithography may be used. Overlay alignment error should preferably be less than 0.5 microns. The etched areas are subsequently filled by depositing silicon nitride through the mask.

14. Deposit 2 micron of silicon nitride layer . This forms the front surface of the print head. Many other materials could be used. A suitable material should have a relatively high Young s modulus not corrode in water and have a low etch rate in hydrofluoric acid HF . It should also be hydrophilic.

15. Mask and etch nozzle rims not shown . These are 1 micron annular protrusions above the print head surface around the nozzles e.g. which help to prevent ink flooding the surface of the print head. They work in conjunction with the hydrophobizing of the print head front surface.

16. Mask and etch the nozzle holes . This mask also includes smaller holes e.g. which are placed to allow the ingress of the etchant for the sacrificial layers. These holes should be small enough to that the ink surface tension ensures that ink is not ejected from the holes when the ink pressure waves from nearby actuated nozzles is at a maximum. Also the holes should be small enough to ensure that air bubbles are not ingested at times of low ink pressure. These holes are spaced close enough so that etchant can easily remove all of the sacrificial material even though the paddle and actuator are fairly large and flexible stiction should not be a problem for this design. This is because the paddle is made from PTFE.

17. Etch ink access holes not shown through the wafer . This can be done as an anisotropic crystallographic silicon etch or an anisotropic dry etch. A dry etch system capable of high aspect ratio deep silicon trench etching such as the Surface Technology Systems STS Advance Silicon Etch ASE system is recommended for volume production as the chip size can be reduced over wet etch. The wet etch is suitable for small volume production as the chip size can be reduced over wet etch. The wet etch is suitable for small volume production where a suitable plasma etch system is not available. Alternatively but undesirably ink access can be around the sides of the print head chips. If ink access is through the wafer higher ink flow is possible and there is less requirement for high accuracy assembly. If ink access is around the edge of the chip ink flow is severely limited and the print head chips must be carefully assembled onto ink channel chips. This latter process is difficult due to the possibility of damaging the fragile nozzle plate. If plasma etching is used the chips can be effectively diced at the same time. Separating the chips by plasma etching allows them to be spaced as little as 35 micron apart increasing the number of chips on a wafer. At this stage the chips must be handled carefully as each chip is a beam of silicon 100 mm long by 0.5 mm wide and 0.7 mm thick.

18. Mount the print head chips into print head carriers. These are mechanical support and ink connection mouldings. The print head carriers can be moulded from plastic as the minimum dimensions are 0.5 mm.

19. Probe test the print heads and bond the good print heads. Bonding may be by wire bonding or TAB bonding.

20. Etch the sacrificial layers. This can be done with an isotropic wet etch such as buffered HF. This stage is performed after the mounting of the print heads into moulded print head carriers and after bonding as the front surface of the print heads is very fragile after the sacrificial etch has been completed. There should be no direct handling of the print head chips after the sacrificial etch.

One form of detailed manufacturing process which can be used to fabricate monolithic ink jet printheads operating in accordance with the principles taught by the present embodiment can proceed utilizing the following steps

In a preferred embodiment there is provided an ink jet printer having ink ejection nozzles from which ink is ejected with the ink ejection being actuated by means of a thermal actuator which includes a corrugated copper heating element encased in a polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE layer.

Turning now to there is illustrated a cross sectional view of a single inkjet nozzle as constructed in accordance with the present embodiment. The inkjet nozzle includes an ink ejection port for the ejection of ink from a chamber by means of actuation of a thermal paddle actuator . The thermal paddle actuator comprises an inner copper heating portion and paddle which are encased in an outer PTFE layer . The outer PTFE layer has an extremely high coefficient of thermal expansion approximately 770 10 or around 380 times that of silicon . The PTFE layer is also highly hydrophobic which results in an air bubble being formed under the actuator due to out gassing etc. The top PTFE layer is treated so as to make it hydrophilic. The heater is also formed within the lower portion of the actuator .

The heater is connected at ends see also to a lower CMOS drive layer containing drive circuitry not shown . For the purposes of actuation of actuator a current is passed through the copper heater element which heats the bottom surface of actuator . Turning now to the bottom surface of actuator in contact with air bubble remains heated while any top surface heating is carried away by the exposure of the top surface of actuator to the ink within chamber . Hence the bottom PTFE layer expands more rapidly resulting in a general rapid bending upwards of actuator as illustrated in which consequentially causes the ejection of ink from ink ejection port . An air inlet channel is formed between two nitride layers such that air is free to flow along channel and through holes e.g. in accordance with any fluctuating pressure influences. The air flow acts to reduce the vacuum on the back surface of actuator during operation. As a result less energy is required for the movement of the actuator .

The actuator can be deactivated by turning off the current to heater element . This will result in a return of the actuator to its rest position.

The actuator includes a number of significant features. In there is illustrated a schematic diagram of the conductive layer of the thermal actuator . The conductive layer includes paddle which can be constructed from the same material as heater i.e. copper and which contains a series of holes e.g. . The holes are provided for interconnecting layers of PTFE both above and below panel so as to resist any movement of the PTFE layers past the panel and thereby reducing any opportunities for the delamination of the PTFE and copper layers.

Turning to there is illustrated a close up view of a portion of the actuator of illustrating the corrugated nature of the heater element within the PTFE nature of actuator of . The corrugated nature of the heater allows for a more rapid heating of the portions of the bottom layer surrounding the corrugated heater. Any resistive heater which is based upon applying a current to heat an object will result in a rapid substantially uniform elevation in temperature of the outer surface of the current carrying conductor. The surrounding PTFE volume is therefore heated by means of thermal conduction from the resistive element. This thermal conduction is known to proceed to a first approximation at a substantially linear rate with respect to distance from a resistive element. By utilizing a corrugated resistive element the bottom surface of actuator is more rapidly heated as on average a greater volume of the bottom PTFE surface is closer to a portion of the resistive element. Therefore the utilisation of a corrugated resistive element results in a more rapid heating of the bottom surface layer and therefore a more rapid actuation of the actuator . Further a corrugated heater also assists in resisting any delamination of the copper and PTFE layer.

Turning now to the corrugated resistive element can be formed by depositing a resist layer on top of the first PTFE layer . The resist layer is exposed utilizing a mask having a half tone pattern delineating the corrugations. After development the resist contains the corrugation pattern. The resist layer and the PTFE layer are then etched utilizing an etchant that erodes the resist layer at substantially the same rate as the PTFE layer . This transfers the corrugated pattern into the PTFE layer . Turning to on top of the corrugated PTFE layer is deposited the copper heater layer which takes on a corrugated form in accordance with its under layer. The copper heater layer is then etched in a serpentine or concertina form. Subsequently a further PTFE layer is deposited on top of layer so as to form the top layer of the thermal actuator . Finally the second PTFE layer is planarized to form the top surface of the thermal actuator .

Returning again now to it is noted that an ink supply can be supplied through a throughway for channel which can be constructed by means of deep anisotropic silicon trench etching such as that available from STS Limited Advanced Silicon Etching Using High Density Plasmas by J. K. Bhardwaj H. Ashraf page 224 of Volume 2639 of the SPIE Proceedings in Micro Machining and Micro Fabrication Process Technology . The ink supply flows from channel through the side grill portions e.g. see also into chamber . Importantly the grill portions e.g. which can comprise silicon nitride or similar insulating material acts to remove foreign bodies from the ink flow. The grill also helps to pinch the PTFE actuator to a base CMOS layer the pinching providing an important assistance for the thermal actuator so as to ensure a substantially decreased likelihood of the thermal actuator layer separating from a base CMOS layer .

A series of sacrificial etchant holes e.g. are provided in the top wall of the chamber to allow sacrificial etchant to enter the chamber during fabrication so as to increase the rate of etching. The small size of the holes e.g. does not affect the operation of the device substantially as the surface tension across holes e.g. stops ink being ejected from these holes whereas the larger size hole allows for the ejection of ink.

Turning now to there is illustrated an exploded perspective view of a single nozzle . The nozzles can be formed in layers starting with a silicon wafer device having a CMOS layer on top thereof as required. The CMOS layer provides the various drive circuitry for driving the copper heater elements .

On top of the CMOS layer a nitride layer is deposited providing primarily protection for lower layers from corrosion or etching. Next a nitride layer is constructed having the aforementioned holes e.g. and posts e.g. . The structure of the nitride layer can be formed by first laying down a sacrificial glass layer not shown onto which the nitride layer is deposited. The nitride layer includes various features for example a lower ridge portion in addition to vias for the subsequent material layers.

In construction of the actuator the process of creating a first PTFE layer proceeds by laying down a sacrificial layer on top of layer in which the air bubble underneath actuator subsequently forms. On top of this is formed a first PTFE layer utilizing the relevant mask. Preferably the PTFE layer includes vias for the subsequent copper interconnections. Next a copper layer is deposited on top of the first PTFE layer and a subsequent PTFE layer is deposited on top of the copper layer in each case utilizing the required mask.

The nitride layer can be formed by the utilisation of a sacrificial glass layer which is masked and etched as required to form the side walls and the grill . Subsequently the top nitride layer is deposited again utilizing the appropriate mask having considerable holes as required. Subsequently the various sacrificial layers can be etched away so as to release the structure of the thermal actuator.

In there is illustrated a section of an ink jet printhead configuration utilizing ink jet nozzles constructed in accordance with a preferred embodiment e.g. . The configuration can be utilized in a three color process 1600 dpi printhead utilizing 3 sets of 2 rows of nozzle chambers e.g. which are interconnected to one ink supply channel e.g. for each set. The 3 supply channels are interconnected to cyan magenta and yellow ink reservoirs respectively.

6. Etch the PTFE using Mask 2. This mask defines the edges of the PTFE venting layer and the holes in this layer. This step is shown in .

8. Etch the sacrificial layer using Mask 3. This mask defines the actuator anchor point. This step is shown in .

10. Deposit expose and develop 1 micron of resist using Mask 4. This mask is a gray scale mask which defines the heater vias as well as the corrugated PTFE surface that the heater is subsequently deposited on.

11. Etch the PTFE and resist at substantially the same rate. The corrugated resist thickness is transferred to the PTFE and the PTFE is completely etched in the heater via positions. In the corrugated regions the resultant PTFE thickness nominally varies between 0.25 micron and 0.75 micron though exact values are not critical. This step is shown in .

13. Deposit 0.5 microns of gold or other heater material with a low Young s modulus and strip the resist. Steps 12 and 13 form a lift off process. This step is shown in .

15. Etch the PTFE down to the sacrificial layer using Mask 6. This mask defines the actuator paddle and the bond pads. This step is shown in .

16. Wafer probe. All electrical connections are complete at this point and the chips are not yet separated.

17. Plasma process the PTFE to make the top and side surfaces of the paddle hydrophilic. This allows the nozzle chamber to fill by capillarity.

19. Etch the sacrificial material down to nitride using Mask 7. This mask defines the nozzle chamber. This step is shown in .

21. Etch to a depth of 1 micron using Mask 8. This mask defines the nozzle rim . This step is shown in .

22. Etch down to the sacrificial layer using Mask 9. This mask defines the nozzle and the sacrificial etch access holes e.g. . This step is shown in .

23. Back etch completely through the silicon wafer with for example an ASE Advanced Silicon Etcher from Surface Technology Systems using Mask 10. This mask defines the ink inlets which are etched through the wafer. The wafer is also diced by this etch. This step is shown in .

24. Back etch the CMOS oxide layers and subsequently deposited nitride layers and sacrificial layer through to PTFE using the back etched silicon as a mask.

25. Etch the sacrificial material. The nozzle chambers are cleared the actuators freed and the chips are separated by this etch. This step is shown in .

26. Mount the printheads in their packaging which may be a molded plastic former incorporating ink channels which supply the appropriate color ink to the ink inlets at the back of the wafer.

27. Connect the printheads to their interconnect systems. For a low profile connection with minimum disruption of airflow TAB may be used. Wire bonding may also be used if the printer is to be operated with sufficient clearance to the paper.

In a preferred embodiment a drop on demand ink jet nozzle arrangement is provided which allows for the ejection of ink on demand by means of a thermal actuator which operates to eject the ink from a nozzle chamber. The nozzle chamber is formed directly over an ink supply channel thereby allowing for an extremely compact form of nozzle arrangement. The extremely compact form of nozzle arrangement allows for minimal area to be taken up by a printing mechanism thereby resulting in improved economics of fabrication.

Turning initially to the operation of a preferred embodiment of the nozzle arrangement is now described. In there is illustrated a sectional view of two ink jet nozzle arrangements which are formed on a silicon wafer which includes a series of through wafer ink supply channels .

Located over a portion of the wafer and over the ink supply channel is a thermal actuator which is actuated so as to eject ink from a corresponding nozzle chamber. The actuator is placed substantially over the ink supply channel . In the quiescent position the ink fills the nozzle chamber and an ink meniscus forms across an ink ejection port of the chamber.

When it is desired to eject a drop from the chamber the thermal actuator is activated by passing a current through the actuator . The actuation causes the actuator to rapidly bend upwards as indicated in . The movement of the actuator results in an increase in the ink pressure around the ejection port of the chamber which in turn causes a significant bulging of the meniscus and the flow of ink out of the nozzle chamber. The actuator can be constructed so as to impart sufficient momentum to the ink to cause the direct ejection of a drop.

Alternatively as indicated in the activation of actuator can be timed so as to turn the actuation current off at a predetermined point. This causes the return of the actuator to its original position thereby resulting in a consequential backflow of ink in the direction of an arrow into the chamber. This causes a necking and separation of a body of ink which has a continuing momentum and continues towards the output media such as paper for printing thereof. The actuator then returns to its quiescent position and surface tension effects result in a refilling of the nozzle chamber via the ink supply channel as a consequence of surface tension effects on the meniscus . In time the condition of the ink returns to that depicted in .

Turning now to there is illustrated the structure of a single nozzle arrangement in more detail. is a part sectional view while shows a corresponding exploded perspective view. Many ink jet nozzles can be formed at a time on a selected wafer base utilizing standard semi conductor processing techniques in addition to micro machining and micro fabrication process technology MEMS and a full familiarity with these technologies is hereinafter assumed.

On top of the silicon wafer layer is formed a CMOS layer . The CMOS layer can in accordance with standard techniques include multi level metal layers sandwiched between oxide layers and preferably at least a two level metal process is utilized. In order to reduce the number of necessary processing steps the masks utilized include areas which provide for a build up of an aluminum barrier which can be constructed from a first level of aluminum and second level of aluminum layer. Additionally aluminum portions are provided which define electrical contacts to a subsequent heater layer. The aluminum barrier portion is important for providing an effective barrier to the possible subsequent etching of the oxide within the CMOS layer when a sacrificial etchant is utilized in the construction of the nozzle arrangement with the etchable material preferably being glass layers.

On top of the CMOS layer is formed a nitride passivation layer to protect the lower CMOS layers from sacrificial etchants and ink erosion. Above the nitride layer there is formed a gap in which an air bubble forms during operation. The gap can be constructed by laying down a sacrificial layer and subsequently etching the gap as will be explained hereinafter.

On top of the air gap is constructed a polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE layer which comprises a gold serpentine heater layer sandwiched between two PTFE layers. The gold heater layer is constructed in a serpentine form to allow it to expand on heating. The heater layer and PTFE layer together comprise the thermal actuator of .

The outer PTFE layer has an extremely high coefficient of thermal expansion approximately 770 10 or around 380 times that of silicon . The PTFE layer is also normally highly hydrophobic which results in an air bubble being formed under the actuator in the gap due to out gassing etc. The top PTFE surface layer is treated so as to make it hydrophilic in addition to those areas around ink supply channel . This can be achieved with a plasma etch in an ammonia atmosphere. The heater layer is also formed within the lower portion of the PTFE layer.

The heater layer is connected at ends e.g. to the lower CMOS drive layer which contains the drive circuitry not shown . For operation of the actuator a current is passed through the gold heater element which heats the bottom surface of the actuator . The bottom surface of actuator in contact with the air bubble remains heated while any top surface heating is carried away by the exposure of the top surface of actuator to the ink within a chamber . Hence the bottom PTFE layer expands more rapidly resulting in a general rapid upward bending of actuator as illustrated in which consequentially causes the ejection of ink from the ink ejection port .

The actuator can be deactivated by turning off the current to the heater layer . This will result in a return of the actuator to its rest position.

On top of the actuator are formed nitride side wall portions and a top wall portion . The wall portions and the top portions can be formed via a dual damascene process utilizing a sacrificial layer. The top wall portion is etched to define the ink ejection port in addition to a series of etchant holes which are of a relatively small diameter and allow for effective etching of lower sacrificial layers when utilizing a sacrificial etchant. The etchant holes are made small enough such that surface tension effects restrict the possibilities of ink being ejected from the chamber via the etchant holes rather than the ejection port .

Turning now to there will now be explained the various steps involved in the construction of an array of ink jet nozzle arrangements 

1. Turning initially to the starting position comprises a silicon wafer including a CMOS layer which has nitride passivation layer and which is surface finished with a chemical mechanical planarization process.

2. The nitride layer is masked and etched as illustrated in so as to define portions of the nozzle arrangement and areas for interconnection between any subsequent heater layer and a lower CMOS layer.

3. Next a sacrificial oxide layer is deposited masked and etched as indicated in with the oxide layer being etched in those areas that a subsequent heater layer electronically contacts the lower layers.

4. As illustrated in next a 1 micron layer of PTFE is deposited and first masked and etched for the heater contacts to the lower CMOS layer and then masked and etched for the heater shape.

5. Next as illustrated in the gold heater layer is deposited. Due to the fact that it is difficult to etch gold the layer can be conformally deposited and subsequently portions removed utilizing chemical mechanical planarization so as to leave those portions associated with the heater element. The processing steps 4 and 5 basically comprise a dual damascene process.

6. Next a top PTFE layer is deposited and masked and etched down to the sacrificial layer as illustrated in so as to define the heater shape. Subsequently the surface of the PTFE layer is plasma processed so as to make it hydrophilic. Suitable processing can including plasma damage in an ammonia atmosphere. Alternatively the surface could be coated with a hydrophilic material.

7. A further sacrificial layer is then deposited and etched as illustrated in so as to form the structure for the nozzle chamber. The sacrificial oxide being is masked and etched in order to define the nozzle chamber walls.

8. Next as illustrated in the nozzle chamber is formed by conformally depositing three microns of nitride and etching a mask nozzle rim to a depth of one micron for the nozzle rim the etched depth not being overly time critical . Subsequently a mask is utilized to etch the ink ejection port in addition to the sacrificial layer etchant holes .

9. Next as illustrated in the backside of the wafer is masked for the ink channels and plasma etched through the wafer. A suitable plasma etching process can include a deep anisotropic trench etching system such as that available from SDS Systems Limited See Advanced Silicon Etching Using High Density Plasmas by J. K. Bhardwaj H. Ashraf page 224 of Volume 2639 of the SPIE Proceedings in Micro Machining and Micro Fabrication Process Technology .

10. Next as illustrated in the sacrificial layers are etched away utilizing a sacrificial etchant such as hydrochloric acid. Subsequently the portion underneath the actuator which is around the ink channel is plasma processed through the backside of the wafer to make the panel end hydrophilic.

Subsequently the wafer can be separated into separate printheads and each printhead is bonded into an injection molded ink supply channel and the electrical signals to the chip can be tape automated bonded TAB to the printhead for subsequent testing. illustrates a top view of nozzle arrangement constructed on a wafer so as to provide for pagewidth multicolor output.

One form of detailed manufacturing process which can be used to fabricate monolithic ink jet printheads operating in accordance with the principles taught by the present embodiment can proceed utilizing the following steps 

1. Using a double sided polished wafer Complete drive transistors data distribution and timing circuits using a 0.5 micron one poly 2 metal CMOS process . This step is shown in . For clarity these diagrams may not be to scale and may not represent a cross section though any single plane of the nozzle. is a key to representations of various materials in these manufacturing diagrams and those of other cross referenced ink jet configurations.

2. Deposit 1 micron of low stress nitride . This acts as a barrier to prevent ink diffusion through the silicon dioxide of the chip surface.

4. Etch the sacrificial layer using Mask 1. This mask defines the actuator anchor point. This step is shown in .

8. Deposit 0.5 microns of gold or other heater material with a low Young s modulus and strip the resist. Steps 7 and 8 form a lift off process. This step is shown in .

10. Etch the PTFE down to the sacrificial layer using Mask 4. This mask defines the actuator and the bond pads. This step is shown in .

11. Wafer probe. All electrical connections are complete at this point and the chips are not yet separated.

12. Plasma process the PTFE to make the top and side surfaces of the actuator hydrophilic. This allows the nozzle chamber to fill by capillarity.

14. Etch the sacrificial material down to nitride using Mask 5. This mask defines the nozzle chamber. This step is shown in .

16. Etch to a depth of 1 micron using Mask 6. This mask defines a rim of the ejection port. This step is shown in .

17. Etch down to the sacrificial layer using Mask 7. This mask defines the ink ejection port and the sacrificial etch access holes . This step is shown in .

18. Back etch completely through the silicon wafer with for example an ASE Advanced Silicon Etcher from Surface Technology Systems using Mask 8. This mask defines the ink inlets which are etched through the wafer. The wafer is also diced by this etch. This step is shown in .

19. Back etch the CMOS oxide layers and subsequently deposited nitride layers and sacrificial layer through to PTFE using the back etched silicon as a mask.

20. Plasma process the PTFE through the back etched holes to make the top surface of the actuator hydrophilic. This allows the nozzle chamber to fill by capillarity but maintains a hydrophobic surface underneath the actuator. This hydrophobic section causes an air bubble to be trapped under the actuator when the nozzle is filled with a water based ink. This bubble serves two purposes to increase the efficiency of the heater by decreasing thermal conduction away from the heated side of the PTFE and to reduce the negative pressure on the back of the actuator.

21. Etch the sacrificial material. The nozzle arrangements are cleared the actuators freed and the chips are separated by this etch. This step is shown in .

22. Mount the printheads in their packaging which may be a molded plastic former incorporating ink channels which supply the appropriate color ink to the ink inlets at the back of the wafer.

23. Connect the printheads to their interconnect systems. For a low profile connection with minimum disruption of airflow TAB may be used. Wire bonding may also be used if the printer is to be operated with sufficient clearance to the paper.

In a preferred embodiment the actuation of an actuator for the ejection of ink is based around the utilization of material having a High Young s modulus.

In a preferred embodiment materials are utilized for the ejection of ink which have a high bend efficiency when thermally heated. The inkjet printhead is constructed utilizing standard MEMS technology and therefore should utilize materials that are common in the construction of semi conductor wafers. In a preferred embodiment the materials have been chosen by using a bend efficiency for actuator devices which can be calculated in accordance with the following formula.

Of course different equations could be utilized and in particular the factors on the numerator and the denominator have been chosen for their following qualities.

Coefficient of thermal expansion The greater the coefficient of thermal expansion the greater will be the degree of movement for any particular heating of a thermal actuator.

Young s Modulus The Young s modulus provides a measure of the tensile or compressive stress of a material and is an indicator of the strength of the bending movement. Hence a material having a high Young s modulus or strength is desirable.

Heat capacity In respect of the heat capacity the higher the heat capacity the greater the ability of material to absorb heat without deformation. This is an undesirable property in a thermal actuator.

Density The denser the material the greater the heat energy required to heat the material and again this is an undesirable property.

Utilizing the above equation it can be seen that a suitable material is titanium diboride TiB which has a high bend efficiency and is also regularly used in semiconductor fabrication techniques. Although this material has a High Young s modulus the coefficient of thermal expansion is somewhat lower than other possible materials. Hence in a preferred embodiment a fulcrum arrangement is utilized to substantially increase the travel of a material upon heating thereby more fully utilizing the effect of the High Young s modulus material.

Turning initially to there is illustrated a single nozzle arrangement of an inkjet printhead constructed in accordance with a preferred embodiment. illustrates a side perspective view of the nozzle arrangement and is an exploded perspective view of the nozzle arrangement of . The single nozzle arrangement can be constructed as part of an array of nozzle arrangements formed on a silicon wafer utilizing standard MEM processing techniques. On top of the silicon wafer is formed a CMOS layer which can include multiple metal layers formed within glass layers in accordance with the normal CMOS methodologies.

The wafer can contain a number of etched chambers e.g. the chambers being etched through the wafer utilizing a deep trench silicon etcher.

A suitable plasma etching process can include a deep anisotropic trench etching system such as that available from SDS Systems Limited See Advanced Silicon Etching Using High Density Plasmas by J. K. Bhardwaj H. Ashraf page 224 of Volume 2639 of the SPIE Proceedings in Micro Machining and Micro Fabrication Process Technology .

A preferred embodiment includes two arms which operate in air and are constructed from a thin 0.3 micrometer layer of titanium diboride on top of a much thicker 5.8 micron layer of glass . The two arms are joined together and pivot around a point which is a thin membrane forming an enclosure which in turn forms part of the nozzle chamber .

The arms and are affixed by posts to lower aluminum conductive layers which can form part of the CMOS layer . The outer surfaces of the nozzle chamber can be formed from glass or nitride and provide an enclosure to be filled with ink. The outer chamber includes a number of etchant holes e.g. which are provided for the rapid sacrificial etchant of internal cavities during construction. A nozzle rim is further provided around an ink ejection port for the ejection of ink.

The paddle surface is bent downwards as a result of release of the structure during fabrication. A current is passed through the titanium boride layer to cause heating of this layer along arms and . The heating generally expands the TiBlayer of arms and which have a high young s modulus. This expansion acts to bend the arms generally downwards which are in turn pivoted around the membrane . The pivoting results in a rapid upward movement of the paddle surface . The upward movement of the paddle surface causes the ejection of ink from the nozzle chamber . The increase in pressure is insufficient to overcome the surface tension characteristics of the smaller etchant holes with the result being that ink is ejected from the nozzle chamber hole .

As noted previously the thin titanium diboride strip has a sufficiently high young s modulus so as to cause the glass layer to be bent upon heating of the titanium diboride layer . Hence the operation of the inkjet device can be as illustrated in . In its quiescent state the inkjet nozzle is as illustrated in generally in the bent down position with the ink meniscus forming a slight bulge and the paddle being pivoted around the membrane wall . The heating of the titanium diboride layer causes it to expand. Subsequently it is bent by the glass layer so as to cause the pivoting of the paddle around the membrane wall as indicated in . This causes the rapid expansion of the meniscus resulting in the general ejection of ink from the nozzle chamber . Next the current to the titanium diboride layer is turned off and the paddle returns to its quiescent state resulting in a general sucking back of ink via the meniscus which in turn results in the ejection of a drop on demand from the nozzle chamber .

Although many different alternatives are possible the arrangement of a preferred embodiment can be constructed utilizing the following processing steps 

1. The starting wafer is a CMOS processed wafer with suitable electrical circuitry for the operation of an array of printhead nozzles and includes aluminum layer portions .

2. First the CMOS wafer layer can be etched down to the silicon wafer layer in the area of an ink supply channel .

3. Next a sacrificial layer can be constructed on top of the CMOS layer and planarized. A suitable sacrificial material can be aluminum. This layer is planarized masked and etched to form cavities for the glass layer . Subsequently a glass layer is deposited on top of the sacrificial aluminum layer and etched so as to form the glass layer and a layer .

4. A titanium diboride layer is then deposited followed by the deposition of a second sacrificial material layer the material again can be aluminum the layer subsequently being planarized.

5. The sacrificial etchant layer is then etched to form cavities for the deposition of the side walls e.g. of the top of the nozzle chamber .

6. A glass layer is then deposited on top of the sacrificial layer and etched so as to form a roof of the chamber layer.

7. The rim ink ejection port and etchant holes e.g. can then be formed in the glass layer utilizing suitable etching processes.

8. The sacrificial aluminum layers are sacrificially etched away so as to release the MEMS structure.

9. The ink supply channels can be formed through the back etching of the silicon wafer utilizing a deep anisotropic trench etching system such as that available from Silicon Technology Systems. The deep trench etching systems can also be simultaneously utilized to separate printheads of a wafer which can then be mounted on an ink supply system and tested for operational capabilities.

Turning finally to there is illustrated a portion of a printhead showing a multi colored series of inkjet nozzles suitably arranged to form a multi colored printhead. The portion is shown partially in section so as to illustrate the through wafer etching process

In a preferred embodiment there is provided an ink jet printing system wherein each nozzle has a nozzle chamber having a slotted side wall through which is formed an actuator mechanism attached to a vane within the nozzle chamber such that the actuator can be activated to move the vane within the nozzle chamber to thereby cause ejection of ink from the nozzle chamber.

Turning now to the figures there is illustrated in an example of an ink jet nozzle arrangement as constructed in accordance with a preferred embodiment. The nozzle arrangement includes a nozzle chamber normally filled with ink and an actuator mechanism for actuating a vane for the ejection of ink from the nozzle chamber via an ink ejection port .

The actuator includes two arms . The two arms can be formed from titanium diboride TiB which has a high Young s modulus and therefore provides a large degree of bending strength. A current is passed along the arms with the arm having a substantially thicker portion along most of its length. The arm is stiff but for in the area of thinned portion and hence the bending moment is concentrated in the area . The thinned arm is of a thinner form and is heated by means of resistive heating of a current passing through the arms . The arms are interconnected with electrical circuitry via connections .

Upon heating of the arm the arm is expanded with the bending of the arm being concentrated in the area . This results in movement of the end of the actuator mechanism which proceeds through a slot in a wall of the nozzle chamber . The bending further causes movement of vane so as to increase the pressure of the ink within the nozzle chamber and thereby cause its subsequent ejection from ink ejection port . The nozzle chamber is refilled via an ink channel formed in a wafer substrate . After movement of the vane so as to cause the ejection of ink the current to arm is turned off which results in a corresponding back movement of the vane . The ink within nozzle chamber is then replenished by means of wafer ink supply channel which is attached to an ink supply formed on the back of wafer . The refill can be by means of a surface tension reduction effect of the ink within nozzle chamber across ink ejection port .

Referring now specifically to a preferred embodiment can be constructed utilizing semiconductor processing techniques in addition to micro machining and micro fabrication process technology MEMS and a full familiarity with these technologies is hereinafter assumed.

The nozzles can preferably be constructed by constructing a large array of nozzles on a single silicon wafer at a time. The array of nozzles can be divided into multiple printheads with each printhead itself having nozzles grouped into multiple colors to provide for full color image reproduction. The arrangement can be constructed via the utilization of a standard silicon wafer substrate upon which is deposited an electrical circuitry layer which can comprise a standard CMOS circuitry layer. The CMOS layer can include an etched portion defining pit . On top of the CMOS layer is initially deposited a protective layer not shown which comprise silicon nitride or the like. On top of this layer is deposited a sacrificial material which is initially suitably etched so as to form cavities for the portion of the thermal actuator and bottom portion of the vane in addition to the bottom rim of nozzle chamber . These cavities can then be filled with titanium diboride. Next a similar process is used to form the glass portions of the actuator. Next a further layer of sacrificial material is deposited and suitably etched so as to form the rest of the vane in addition to a portion of the nozzle chamber walls to the same height of vane .

Subsequently a further sacrificial layer is deposited and etched in a suitable manner so as to form the rest of the nozzle chamber . The top surface of the nozzle chamber is further etched so as to form the nozzle rim rounding the ejection port . Subsequently the sacrificial material is etched away so as to release the construction of a preferred embodiment. It will be readily evident to those skilled in the art that other MEMS processing steps could be utilized.

Preferably the thermal actuator and vane portions and in addition to the nozzle chamber are constructed from titanium diboride. The utilization of titanium diboride is standard in the construction of semiconductor systems and in addition its material properties including a high Young s modulus is utilized to advantage in the construction of the thermal actuator .

Further preferably the actuator is covered with a hydrophobic material such as Teflon so as to prevent any leaking of the liquid out of the slot .

Further as a final processing step the ink channel can be etched through the wafer utilizing a high anisotropic silicon wafer etch. This can be done as an anisotropic crystallographic silicon etch or an anisotropic dry etch. A dry etch system capable of high aspect ratio deep silicon trench etching such as the Surface Technology Systems STS Advance Silicon Etch ASE system is recommended for volume production as the chip size can be reduced over a wet etch. The wet etch is suitable for small volume production where a suitable plasma etch system is not available. Alternatively but undesirably ink access can be around the sides of the printhead chips. If ink access is through the wafer higher ink flow is possible and there is less requirement for high accuracy assembly. If ink access is around the edge of the chip ink flow is severely limited and the printhead chips must be carefully assembled onto ink channel chips. This latter process is difficult due to the possibility of damaging the fragile nozzle plate. If plasma etching is used the chips can be effectively diced at the same time. Separating the chips by plasma etching allows them to be spaced as little as 35 m apart increasing the number of chips on a wafer.

In a preferred embodiment there is provided an inkjet printer having a series of ink ejection mechanisms wherein each ink ejection mechanism includes a paddle actuated by a coil actuator the coil spring actuator having a unique cross section so as to provide for efficient actuation as a coiled thermal actuator.

Turning initially to there is illustrated a single ink ejection mechanism constructed in accordance with the principles of a preferred embodiment. The ink ejection mechanism includes a chamber having a rim . The chamber is normally filled with ink which bulges out around a surface having a border along the edge of rim the ink being retained within the chamber by means of surface tension around the rim . Outside of the chamber is located a thermal actuator device . The thermal actuator device is interconnected via a strut through a hole to a paddle device within the chamber . The strut and hole are treated so as to be hydrophobic. Further the hole is provided in a thin elongated form so that surface tension characteristics also assist in stopping any ink from flowing out of the hole .

The thermal actuator device comprises a first arm portion which can be constructed from glass or other suitable material. A second arm portion can be constructed from material such as titanium diboride which has a large Young s modulus or bending strength and hence when a current is passed through the titanium diboride layer it expands with a predetermined coefficient of thermal expansion. The thin strip has a high Young s modulus or bending strength and therefore the thin strip is able to bend the much thicker strip which has a substantially lower Young s modulus.

Turning to there is illustrated a cross section of the arm through the line II II of illustrating the structure of the actuator device . As described previously the actuator device includes two titanium diboride portions forming a circuit around the coil in addition to the glass portion which also provides for electrical isolation of the two arms the arms being conductively joined at the strut end.

Turning now to there will now be explaining the operation of the ink ejection mechanism for the ejection of ink. Initially before the paddle has started moving the situation is as illustrated in with the nozzle chamber being filled with ink and having a slightly bulging in meniscus . Upon actuation of the actuator mechanism the paddle begins to move towards the nozzle rim resulting in a substantial increase in pressure in the area around the nozzle rim . This in turn results in the situation as illustrated in wherein the meniscus begins to significantly bulge as a result of the increases in pressure. Subsequently the actuator is deactivated resulting in a general urge for the paddle to return to its rest position. This results in the ink being sucked back into the chamber which in turn results in the meniscus necking and breaking off into a meniscus and ink drop the drop proceeding to a paper or film medium not shown for marking. The meniscus has generally a concave shape and surface tension characteristics result in chamber refilling by means of in flow from an ink supply channel etched through the wafer. The refilling is as a consequence of surface tension forces on the meniscus . Eventually the meniscus returns to its quiescent state as illustrated in .

Turning now to there is illustrated an exploded perspective view of a single ink ejection mechanism illustrating the various material layers. The ink ejection mechanism can be formed as part of a large array of mechanisms forming a print head with multiple printheads being simultaneously formed on a silicon wafer . The wafer is initially processed so as to incorporate a standard CMOS circuitry layer which provides for the electrical interconnect for the control of the conductive portions of the actuator. The CMOS layer can be completed with a silicon nitride passivation layer so as to protect it from subsequent processing steps in addition to ink flows through channel . The subsequent layers e.g. and can be deposited utilizing standard micro electro mechanical systems MEMS construction techniques including the deposit of sacrificial aluminum layers in addition to the deposit of the layers constructed from titanium diboride the layer constructed from glass material and the nozzle chamber proper again constructed from titanium diboride. Each of these layers can be built up in a sacrificial material such as aluminum which is subsequently etched away. Further an ink supply channel e.g. can be etched through the wafer . The etching can be by means of an isotropic crystallographic silicon etch or an isotropic dry etch. A dry etch system capable of high aspect ratio silicon trench etching such as the Surface Technology Systems STS Advance Silicon Etch ASE system is recommended.

Subsequent to construction of the nozzle arrangement it can be attached to an ink supply apparatus for supplying ink to the reverse surface of the wafer so that ink can flow into chamber .

The external surface of nozzle chamber including rim in addition to the area surrounding slot can then be hydrophobically treated so as to reduce the possibility of any ink exiting slot .

Ink is supplied to an ink ejection chamber from an ink supply channel which is etched through the wafer . A paddle is located in the ink ejection chamber and attached to a thermal actuator . When the actuator is activated the paddle is moved as illustrated in thereby displacing ink within the ink ejection chamber resulting in the ejection of the ink from the chamber . The actuator comprises a coiled arm which is in turn made up of three sub arm components.

Turning to there is illustrated a section through the line IV IV of illustrating the structure of the arm which includes an upper conductive arm and a lower conductive arm . The two arms can be made from conductive titanium diboride which has a high Young s modulus in addition to a suitably high coefficient of thermal expansion. The two arms are encased in a silicon nitride portion of the arm. The two arms are conductively interconnected at one end of the actuator and at the other end they are electrically interconnected at respectively to control circuitry to a lower CMOS layer which includes the drive circuitry for activating the actuator .

The conductive heating of the arms results in a general expansion of these two arms . The expansion works against the nitride portion of the arm resulting in a partial uncoiling of the actuator which in turn results in a corresponding movement of the paddle resulting in the ejection of ink from the nozzle chamber . The nozzle chamber can include a rim which for convenience can also be constructed from titanium diboride. The rim has an arcuate profile shown at which is shaped to guide the paddle on an arcuate path. Walls defining the ink ejection chamber are similarly profiled. Upon the ejection of a drop the paddle returns to its quiescent position.

In there is shown manufacturing processing steps involved in the fabrication of a preferred embodiment.

1. Starting initially with a starting point for manufacture is a silicon wafer having a CMOS layer which can comprise the normal CMOS processes including multi level metal layers etc. and which provide the electrical circuitry for the operation of a preferred embodiment which can be formed as part of a multiple series or array of nozzles at a single time on a single wafer.

2. The next step in the construction of a preferred embodiment is to form an etched pit as illustrated in .

18. As shown in an ink supply channel can be etched from a back of the wafer . Again an STS deep silicon trench etcher can be utilized.

19. The next step is a wet etch of all exposed glass SiO surfaces of the wafer which results in a substantial release of the paddle structure as illustrated in .

20. Finally as illustrated in the exposed aluminum surfaces are then wet etched away resulting in a release of the paddle structure which springs back to its quiescent or return position ready for operation.

The wafer can then be separated into printhead units and interconnected to an ink supply along the back surface of the wafer for the supply of ink to the nozzle arrangement.

In there is illustrated a portion of an array of nozzles which can include a three color output including a first color series second color series and third color series . Each color series is further divided into two rows of ink ejection units with each unit providing for the ejection ink drops corresponding to a single pixel of a line. Hence a page width array of nozzles can be formed including appropriate bond pads for providing electrical interconnection. The page width printhead can be formed with a silicon wafer with multiple printheads being formed simultaneously using the aforementioned steps. Subsequently the printheads can be separated and joined to an ink supply mechanism for supplying ink via the back of the wafer to each ink ejection arrangement the supply being suitably arranged for providing separate colors.

In a preferred embodiment there is provided an inkjet printhead having an array of nozzles wherein the nozzles are grouped in pairs and each pair is provided with a single actuator which is actuated so as to move a paddle type mechanism to force the ejection of ink out of one or other of the nozzle pairs. The paired nozzles eject ink from a single nozzle chamber which is resupplied by means of an ink supply channel. Further the actuator of a preferred embodiment has unique characteristics so as to simplify the actuation process.

Turning initially to there will now be explained the principles of operation of a preferred embodiment. In a preferred embodiment a single nozzle chamber is utilized to supply ink two ink ejection nozzles . Ink is resupplied to the nozzle chamber via means of an ink supply channel . In its quiescent position to ink menisci are formed around the ink ejection holes . The arrangement of being substantially axially symmetric around a central paddle which is attached to an actuator mechanism.

When it is desired to eject ink out of one of the nozzles say nozzle the paddle is actuated so that it begins to move as indicated in . The movement of paddle in the direction results in a general compression of the ink on the right hand side of the paddle . The compression of the ink results in the meniscus growing as the ink is forced out of the nozzles . Further the meniscus undergoes an inversion as the ink is sucked back on the left hand side of the actuator with additional ink being sucked in from ink supply channel . The paddle actuator eventually comes to rest and begins to return as illustrated in . The ink within meniscus has substantial forward momentum and continues away from the nozzle chamber whilst the paddle causes ink to be sucked back into the nozzle chamber. Further the surface tension on the meniscus results in further in flow of the ink via the ink supply channel . The resolution of the forces at work in the resultant flows results in a general necking and subsequent breaking of the meniscus as illustrated in wherein a drop is formed which continues onto the media or the like. The paddle continues to return to its quiescent position.

Next as illustrated in the paddle returns to its quiescent position and the nozzle chamber refills by means of surface tension effects acting on meniscuses with the arrangement of returning to that showing in . When required the actuator can be activated to eject ink out of the nozzle in a symmetrical manner to that described with reference to . Hence a single actuator is activated to provide for ejection out of multiple nozzles. The dual nozzle arrangement has a number of advantages including in that movement of actuator does not result in a significant vacuum forming on the back surface of the actuator as a result of its rapid movement. Rather meniscus acts to ease the vacuum and further acts as a pump for the pumping of ink into the nozzle chamber. Further the nozzle chamber is provided with a lip which assists in equalizing the increase in pressure around the ink ejection holes which allows for the meniscus to grow in an actually symmetric manner thereby allowing for straight break off of the drop .

Turning now to there is illustrated a suitable nozzle arrangement with showing a single side perspective view and showing a view partly in section illustrating the nozzle chamber. The actuator includes a pivot arm attached at the post . The pivot arm includes an internal core portion which can be constructed from glass. On each side of the internal portion is two separately control heater arms which can be constructed from an alloy of copper and nickel 45 copper and 55 nickel . The utilization of the glass core is advantageous in that it has a low coefficient thermal expansion and coefficient of thermal conductivity. Hence any energy utilized in the heaters is substantially maintained in the heater structure and utilized to expand the heater structure and opposed to an expansion of the glass core . Structure or material chosen to form part of the heater structure preferably has a high bend efficiency . One form of definition of bend efficiency can be the Young s modulus times the coefficient of thermal expansion divided by the density and by the specific heat capacity.

The copper nickel alloy in addition to being conductive has a high coefficient of thermal expansion a low specific heat and density in addition to a high Young s modulus. It is therefore a highly suitable material for construction of the heater element although other materials would also be suitable.

Each of the heater elements can comprise a conductive out and return trace with the traces being insulated from one and other along the length of the trace and conductively joined together at the far end of the trace. The current supply for the heater can come from a lower electrical layer via the pivot anchor . At one end of the actuator there is provided a bifurcated portion which has attached at one end thereof to leaf portions .

To operate the actuator one of the arms e.g. is heated in air by passing current through it. The heating of the arm results in a general expansion of the arm. The expansion of the arm results in a general bending of the arm . The bending of the arm further results in leaf portion pulling on the paddle portion . The paddle is pivoted around a fulcrum point by means of attachment to leaf portions which are generally thin to allow for minor flexing. The pivoting of the arm causes ejection of ink from the nozzle hole . The heater is deactivated resulting in a return of the actuator to its quiescent position and its corresponding return of the paddle also to is quiescent position. Subsequently to eject ink out of the other nozzle hole the heater can be activated with the paddle operating in a substantially symmetric manner.

It can therefore be seen that the actuator can be utilized to move the paddle on demand so as to eject drops out of the ink ejection hole e.g. with the ink refilling via an ink supply channel located under the paddle . The nozzle arrangement of a preferred embodiment can be formed on a silicon wafer utilizing standard semi conductor fabrication processing steps and micro electromechanical systems MEMS construction techniques.

Preferably a large wafer of printheads is constructed at any one time with each printhead providing a predetermined pagewidth capabilities and a single printhead can in turn comprise multiple colors so as to provide for full color output as would be readily apparent to those skilled in the art.

Turning now to . there will now be explained one form of fabrication of a preferred embodiment. A preferred embodiment can start as illustrated in with a CMOS processed silicon wafer which can include a standard CMOS layer including of the relevant electrical circuitry etc. The processing steps can then be as follows 

Subsequently the print head can be washed mounted on an ink chamber relevant electrical interconnections TAB bonded and the print head tested.

Turning now to there is illustrated a portion of a full color printhead which is divided into three series of nozzles and . Each series can supply a separate color via means of a corresponding ink supply channel. Each series is further subdivided into two sub rows e.g. with the relevant nozzles of each sub row being fired simultaneously with one sub row being fired a predetermined time after a second sub row such that a line of ink drops is formed on a page.

As illustrated in the actuators a formed in a curved relationship with respect to the main nozzle access so as to provide for a more compact packing of the nozzles. Further the block portion of is formed in the wall of an adjacent series with the block portion of the row being formed in a separate guide rail provided as an abutment surface for the TAB strip when it is abutted against the guide rail so as to provide for an accurate registration of the tab strip with respect to the bond pads which are provided along the length of the printhead so as to provide for low impedance driving of the actuators.

The principles of a preferred embodiment can obviously be readily extended to other structures. For example a fulcrum arrangement could be constructed which includes two arms which are pivoted around a thinned wall by means of their attachment to a cross bar. Each arm could be attached to the central cross bar by means of similarly leafed portions to that shown in and . The distance between a first arm and the thinned wall can be L units whereas the distance between the second arm and wall can be NL units. Hence when a translational movement is applied to the second arm for a distance of N X units the first arm undergoes a corresponding movement of X units. The leafed portions allow for flexible movement of the arms whilst providing for full pulling strength when required.

It would be evident to those skilled in the art that the present invention can further be utilized in either mechanical arrangements requiring the application forces to induce movement in a structure.

In a preferred embodiment an inkjet printing system is provided for the projection of ink from a series of nozzles. In a preferred embodiment a single paddle is located within a nozzle chamber and attached to an actuator device. When the nozzle is actuated in a first direction ink is ejected through a first nozzle aperture and when the actuator is activated in a second direction causing the paddle to move in a second direction ink is ejected out of a second nozzle. Turning initially to there will now be illustrated in a schematic form the operational principles of a preferred embodiment.

Turning initially to there is shown a nozzle arrangement of a preferred embodiment when in its quiescent state. In the quiescent state ink fills a first portion of the nozzle chamber and a second portion of the nozzle chamber. A baffle is situated between the first portion and the second portion of the nozzle chamber. The ink fills the nozzle chambers from an ink supply channel to the point that a meniscus is formed around corresponding nozzle holes . A paddle is provided within the nozzle chamber with the paddle being interconnected to an actuator device which can comprise a thermal actuator which can be actuated so as to cause the actuator to bend as will be become more apparent hereinafter.

In order to eject ink from the first nozzle hole the actuator which can comprise a thermal actuator is activated so as to bend as illustrated in . The bending of actuator causes the paddle to rapidly move upwards which causes a substantial increase in the pressure of the fluid such as ink within nozzle chamber and adjacent to the meniscus . This results in a general rapid expansion of the meniscus as ink flows through the nozzle hole with result of the increasing pressure. The rapid movement of paddle causes a reduction in pressure along the back surface of the paddle . This results in general flows as indicated from the second nozzle chamber and the ink supply channel. Next while the meniscus is extended the actuator is deactivated resulting in the return of the paddle to its quiescent position as indicated in . The return of the paddle operates against the forward momentum of the ink adjacent the meniscus which subsequently results in the breaking off of the meniscus so as to form the drop as illustrated in . The drop continues onto the print media. Further surface tension effects on the ink meniscus and ink meniscus result in ink flows which replenish the nozzle chambers. Eventually the paddle returns to its quiescent position and the situation is again as illustrated in .

Subsequently when it is desired to eject a drop via ink ejection hole the actuator is activated as illustrated in . The actuation causes the paddle to move rapidly down causing a substantial increase in pressure in the nozzle chamber which results in a rapid growth of the meniscus around the nozzle hole . This rapid growth is accompanied by a general collapse in meniscus as the ink is sucked back into the chamber . Further ink flow also occurs into ink supply channel however hopefully this ink flow is minimized. Subsequently as indicated in the actuator is deactivated resulting in the return of the paddle to is quiescent position. The return of the paddle results in a general lessening of pressure within the nozzle chamber as ink is sucked back into the area under the paddle . The forward momentum of the ink surrounding the meniscus and the backward momentum of the other ink within nozzle chamber is resolved through the breaking off of an ink drop which proceeds towards the print media. Subsequently the surface tension on the meniscus and results in a general ink inflow from nozzle chamber resulting in the arrangement returning to the quiescent state as indicated in .

It can therefore be seen that the schematic illustration of to describes a system where a single planar paddle is actuated so as to eject ink from multiple nozzles.

Turning now to there is illustrated a sectional view through one form of implementation of a single nozzle arrangement . The nozzle arrangement can be constructed on a silicon wafer base through the construction of large arrays of nozzles at one time using standard micro electro mechanical processing techniques.

An array of nozzles on a silicon wafer device and can be constructed using semiconductor processing techniques in addition to micro machining and micro fabrication process technology MEMS and a full familiarity with these technologies is hereinafter assumed.

One form of construction will now be described with reference to . On top of the silicon wafer is first constructed a CMOS processing layer which can provide for the necessary interface circuitry for driving the thermal actuator and its interconnection with the outside world. The CMOS layer being suitably passivated so as to protect it from subsequent MEMS processing techniques. The walls e.g. can be formed from glass SiO . Preferably the paddle includes a thinned portion for more efficient operation. Additionally a sacrificial etchant hole is provided for allowing more effective etching of sacrificial etchants within the nozzle chamber . The ink supply channel is generally provided for interconnecting an ink supply conduit which can be etched through the wafer by means of a deep anisotropic trench etcher such as that available from Silicon Technology Systems of the United Kingdom.

The arrangement further includes a thermal actuator device e.g. which includes two arms comprising an upper arm and a lower arm extending from a port and formed around a glass core . Both upper and lower arm heaters can comprise a 0.4 m film of 60 copper and 40 nickel hereinafter known as Cupronickel alloy. Copper and nickel is used because it has a high bend efficiency and is also highly compatible with standard VLSI and MEMS processing techniques. The bend efficiency can be calculated as the square of the coefficient of the thermal expansion times the Young s modulus divided by the density and divided by the heat capacity. This provides a measure of the amount of bend energy produced by a material per unit of thermal and therefore electrical energy supplied.

The core can be fabricated from glass which also has many suitable properties in acting as part of the thermal actuator. The actuator includes a thinned portion for providing an interconnect between the actuator and the paddle . The thinned portion provides for non destructive flexing of the actuator . Hence when it is desired to actuate the actuator say to cause it to bend downwards a current is passed down through the top cupronickel layer causing it to be heated and expand. This in turn causes a general bending due to the thermocouple relationship between the layers and . The bending down of the actuator also causes thinned portion to move downwards in addition to the portion . Hence the paddle is pivoted around the wall which can if necessary include slots for providing for efficient bending. Similarly the heater coil can be operated so as to cause the actuator to bend up with the consequential movement upon the paddle .

A pit is provided adjacent to the wall of the nozzle chamber to ensure that any ink outside of the nozzle chamber has minimal opportunity to wick along the surface of the printhead as the wall can be provided with a series of slots to assist in the flexing of the fulcrum.

Turning now to there will now be described one form of processing construction of a preferred embodiment of . This can involve the following steps 

1. Initially as illustrated in starting with a fully processed CMOS wafer the CMOS layer is deep silicon etched so as to provide for the nozzle ink inlet .

2. Next as illustrated in a 7 micron layer of a suitable sacrificial material for example aluminum is deposited and etched with a nozzle wall mask in addition to the electrical interconnect mask.

3. Next as illustrated in a 7 micron layer of low stress glass is deposited and planarized using chemical planarization.

4. Next as illustrated in the sacrificial material is etched to a depth of 0.4 micron and the glass to at least a level of 0.4 micron utilizing a first heater mask.

5. Next as illustrated in the glass layer is etched down to the aluminum portions of the CMOS layer providing for an electrical interconnect using a first heater via mask.

6. Next as illustrated in a 3 micron layer of 50 copper and 40 nickel alloy is deposited and planarized using chemical mechanical planarization.

7. Next as illustrated in a 4 micron layer of low stress glass is deposited and etched to a depth of 0.5 micron utilizing a mask for the second heater.

8. Next as illustrated in the deposited glass layer is etched down to the cupronickel using a second heater via mask.

9. Next as illustrated in a 3 micron layer of cupronickel is deposited and planarized using chemical mechanical planarization.

12. Next as illustrated in the glass is again etched to a depth of 3 micron utilizing a second paddle mask with the first mask utilized in etching away those areas not having any portion of the paddle and the second mask as illustrated in etching away those areas having a thinned portion. Both the first and second mask of and can be a timed etch.

13. Next as illustrated in the glass is etched to a depth of 7 micron using a third paddle mask. The third paddle mask leaving the nozzle wall baffle thinned wall and end portion which fixes one end of the thermal actuator firmly to the substrate.

14. The next step as illustrated in is to deposit an 11 micron layer of sacrificial material such as aluminum and planarize the layer utilizing chemical mechanical planarization.

15. As illustrated in a 3 micron layer of glass is deposited and etched to a depth of 1 micron utilizing a nozzle rim mask.

16. Next as illustrated in the glass is etched down to the sacrificial layer using a nozzle mask so as to form the nozzle structure .

17. The next step as illustrated in is to back etch an ink supply channel using a deep silicon trench etcher such as that available from Silicon Technology Systems. The printheads can also be diced by this etch.

The printheads can then be inserted in an ink chamber molding tab bonded and a PTFE hydrophobic layer evaporated over the surface so as to provide for a hydrophobic surface.

In there is illustrated a portion of a page with printhead including a series of nozzle arrangements as constructed in accordance with the principles of a preferred embodiment. The array has been constructed for three color output having a first row second row and a third row . Additionally a series of bond pads e.g. are provided at the side for tab automated bonding to the printhead. Each row can be provided with a different color ink including cyan magenta and yellow for providing full color output. The nozzles of each row are further divided into sub rows e.g. . Further a glass strip can be provided for anchoring the actuators of the row in addition to providing for alignment for the bond pad .

The CMOS circuitry can be provided so as to fire the nozzles with the correct timing relationships. For example each nozzle in the row is fired together followed by each nozzle in the row such that a single line is printed.

It could be therefore seen that a preferred embodiment provides for an extremely compact arrangement of an inkjet printhead which can be made in a highly inexpensive manner in large numbers on a single silicon wafer with large numbers of printheads being made simultaneously. Further the actuation mechanism provides for simplified complexity in that the number of actuators is halved with the arrangement of a preferred embodiment.

A preferred embodiment of the present invention includes an inkjet nozzle arrangement wherein a single actuator drives two output nozzles. When the actuator is driven in the first direction ink is ejected out of a first ink ejection port and when the actuator is driven in a second direction ink is ejected out of a second ink ejection port. The paddle actuator is interconnected via a slot in the nozzle chamber wall to a rigid thermal actuator which can be actuated so as to cause the ejection of ink from the ink ejection ports.

Turning initially to there is illustrated a nozzle arrangement of a preferred embodiment with being a sectional view through the line VII VII of . The nozzle arrangement includes two ink ejection ports for the ejection of ink from within a nozzle chamber. The nozzle chamber further includes first and second chamber portions in addition to an etched cavity which during normal operation are normally filled with ink supplied via an ink inlet channel . The ink inlet channel is in turn connected to an ink supply channel etched through a silicon wafer. Inside the nozzle chamber is located an actuator paddle which is interconnected through a slot in the chamber wall to an actuator arm which is actuated by means of heaters which are in turn connected to a substrate via an end block portion with the substrate providing the relevant electrical interconnection for the heaters .

Hence the actuator arm can be actuated by the heaters to move up and down as a result of the expansion of the heaters so as to eject ink via the nozzle holes or . A series of holes are also provided in a top wall of the nozzle arrangement. As will become more readily apparent hereinafter the holes assist in the etching of sacrificial layers during construction in addition to providing for breathing assistance during operation of the nozzle arrangement . The two chambers are separated by a baffle and the paddle arm includes a end lip portion in addition to a plug portion . The plug portion is designed to mate with the boundary of the ink inlet channel during operation.

Turning now to there will now be explained the operation of the nozzle arrangement . Each of illustrate a cross sectional view of the nozzle arrangement during various stages of operation. Turning initially to there is shown the nozzle arrangement when in its quiescent position. In this state the paddle is idle and ink fills the nozzle chamber so as to form menisci and .

When it is desired to eject a drop out of the nozzle port as indicated in the bottom heater is actuated. The heater can comprise a 60 copper and 40 nickel alloy which has a high bending efficiency where the bending efficiency is defined as 

The two heaters can be constructed from the same material and normally exist in a state of balance when the paddle is in its quiescent position. As noted previously when it is desired to eject a drop out of nozzle chamber the heater is actuated which causes a rapid upwards movement of the actuator paddle . This causes a general increase in pressure in the area in front of the actuator paddle which further causes a rapid expansion in the meniscus in addition to a much less significant expansion in the menisci due to their being of a substantially smaller radius . Additionally the substantial decrease in pressure around the back surface of the paddle causes a general inflow of ink through the ink inlet channel in addition to causing a general collapse in the meniscus and a corresponding flow of ink around the baffle . A slight bulging also occurs in the meniscus around the slot in the side wall .

Turning now to the heater is merely pulsed and turned off when it reaches its maximum extent. Hence the paddle actuator rapidly begins to return to its quiescent position causing the ink around the ejection port to begin to flow back into the chamber. The forward momentum of the ink in the expanded meniscus and the backward pressure exerted by actuator paddle results in a general necking of the meniscus and the subsequent breaking off of a separate drop which proceeds to the print media. The menisci and are then each of a generally concave shape and exert a further force on the ink within the nozzle chamber which begins to draw ink in from the ink inlet channel so as to replenish the nozzle chamber. Eventually the nozzle arrangement returns to the quiescent position which is as previously illustrated in respect of .

Turning now to when it is desired to eject a droplet of ink out of the ink ejection port the heater is actuated resulting in a general expansion of the heater which in turn causes a rapid downward movement of the actuator paddle . The rapid downward movement causes a substantial increase in pressure within the cavity which in turn results in a general rapid expansion of the meniscus . The end plug portion results in a general blocking of the ink supply channel stopping fluid from flowing back down the ink supply channel . This further assists in causing ink to flow towards the cavity . The menisci of are drawn generally into the nozzle chamber and may unite so as to form a single meniscus . The meniscus is also drawn into the chamber. The heater is merely pulsed which as illustrated in results in a rapid return of the paddle to its quiescent position. The return of the paddle results in a general reduction in pressure within the cavity which in turn results in the ink around the nozzle beginning to flow back into the nozzle chamber in the direction of arrow . The forward momentum of the ink around the meniscus in addition to the backflow results in a general necking of the meniscus and the formation of an ink drop which separates from the main body of the ink and continues to the print media.

The return of the actuator paddle further results in plugging portion unplugging the ink supply channel . The general reduction in pressure in addition to the collapsed menisci and results in a flow of ink from the ink inlet channel into the nozzle chamber so as to cause replenishment of the nozzle chamber and return to the quiescent state as illustrated in .

Returning now to and a number of other important features of a preferred embodiment include the fact that each of the ports and each of the holes and the slot etc. includes a rim around its outer periphery. The rim acts to stop wicking of the meniscus formed across the nozzle rim. Further the actuator arm is provided with a wick minimization protrusion in addition to a series of pits which are shaped so as to minimize wicking along the surfaces surrounding the actuator arms .

The nozzle arrangement of a preferred embodiment can be formed on a silicon wafer utilizing standard semi conductor fabrication processing steps and micro electromechanical systems MEMS construction techniques.

Preferably a large wafer of printheads is constructed at any one time with each printhead providing a predetermined pagewidth capabilities and a single printhead can in turn comprise multiple colors so as to provide for full color output as would be readily apparent to those skilled in the art.

Turning now to . there will now be explained one form of fabrication of a preferred embodiment in order to describe the structure of the nozzle arrangement .

A suitable sacrificial material is aluminum which is often utilized in MEMS processes as a sacrificial material.

3. Next as illustrated in a 3 micron layer of low stress glass is deposited and planarized utilizing CMP.

4. Next as illustrated in the sacrificial material is etched to a depth of 1.1 micron and the glass is further etched at least 1.1 micron utilizing a first heater mask.

6. Next as illustrated in a 3 micron layer of 60 copper and 40 nickel alloy is deposited and planarized utilizing CMP. The copper and nickel alloy hereinafter called cupronickel is a material having a high bend efficiency as previously described.

10. As illustrated in the glass is etched at down to the cupronickel layer so as to provide for the upper level heater contact.

11. Next as illustrated in a 3 micron layer of cupronickel alloy is deposited and planarized at utilizing CMP.

13. Next as illustrated in the glass is etched at to a depth of 2 micron utilizing a mask for the paddle.

14. Next as illustrated in the glass is etched at to a depth of 7 micron using a mask for the nozzle walls portions of the actuator and the post portion.

15. Next as illustrated in a 9 micron layer of sacrificial material is deposited at and planarized utilizing CMP.

16. Next as illustrated in a 3 micron layer of low stress glass is deposited and etched at to a depth of 1 micron utilizing a nozzle rim mask.

17. Next as illustrated in the glass is etched down to the sacrificial layer at utilizing a nozzle mask.

18. Next as illustrated in an ink supply channel is etched through from the back of the wafer utilizing a silicon deep trench etcher which has near vertical side wall etching properties. A suitable silicon trench etcher is the deep silicon trench etcher available from Silicon Technology Systems of the United Kingdom. The printheads can also be diced as a result of this etch.

19. Next as illustrated in the sacrificial layers are etched away utilizing a wet etch so as release the structure of the printhead.

The printheads can then be washed and inserted in an ink chamber molding for providing an ink supply to the back of the wafer so to allow ink to be supplied via the ink supply channel. The printhead can then have one edge along its surface TAB bonded to external control lines and preferably a thin anti corrosion layer of ECR diamond like carbon deposited over its surfaces so as to provide for anti corrosion capabilities.

Turning now to there is illustrated a portion of a full color printhead which is divided into three series and of nozzle arrangements . Each series can supply a separate color via a corresponding ink supply channel. Each series is further subdivided into two sub rows with the relevant nozzle arrangements of each sub row being fired simultaneously with one sub row being fired a predetermined time after a second sub row such that a line of ink drops is formed on a page.

As illustrated in the actuators are formed in a curved relationship with respect to a line on which each series of nozzle arrangements lies so as to provide for a compact packing of the nozzle arrangements. Further the block portion of is formed in a wall of an adjacent series with the block portion of the row being formed in a separate guide rail provided as an abutment surface for the TAB strip when it is abutted against the guide rail so as to provide for an accurate registration of the tab strip with respect to the bond pads which are provided along the length of the printhead so as to provide for low impedance driving of the actuators.

In a preferred embodiment an inkjet printing system is provided having an ink ejection nozzle arrangement such that a paddle actuator type device is utilized to eject ink from a refillable nozzle chamber. As a result of the construction processes utilized the paddle is generally of a cupped shape. The cup shape provides for the alleviation of a number of the aforementioned problems. The paddle is interconnected to a thermal actuator device which is thermally actuated by means of passing a current through a portion of the thermal actuator so as to cause the ejection of ink therefrom. Further the cupped paddle allows for a suitable construction process which does not require the formation of thick surface layers during the process of construction. This means that thermal stresses across a series of devices constructed on a single wafer are minimized.

Turning initially to there will now be explained the operational principles of a preferred embodiment. In there is illustrated an inkjet nozzle arrangement having a nozzle chamber which is normally filled with ink from a supply channel such that a meniscus forms across the ink ejection aperture of the nozzle arrangement. Inside the nozzle arrangement a cupped paddle actuator is provided and interconnected to an actuator arm which when in a quiescent position is bent downwards. The lower surface of the actuator arm includes a heater element which is constructed of material having a high bend efficiency .

A suitable material can be a copper nickel alloy of 60 copper and 40 nickel hereinafter called cupronickel . which can be formed below a glass layer so as to bend the glass layer.

In its quiescent position the arm is bent down by the element . When it is desired to eject a droplet of ink from the nozzle chamber a current is passed through the actuator arm by means of an interconnection provided by a post . The heater element is heated and expands with a high bend efficiency thereby causing the arm to move upwards as indicated in . The upward movement of the actuator arm causes the cupped paddle to also move up which results in a general increase in pressure within the nozzle chamber in the area surrounding the meniscus . This results in a general outflow of ink and a bulging of the meniscus . Next as indicated in the heater element is turned off which results in the general return of the arm to its quiescent position which further results in a downward movement of the cupped paddle . This results in a general sucking back of the ink within the nozzle chamber . The forward momentum of the ink surrounding the meniscus and the backward momentum of the ink results in a general necking of the meniscus and the formation of a drop which proceeds to the surface of the page. Subsequently the shape of the meniscus results in a subsequent inflow of ink via the inlet channel which results in a refilling of the nozzle chamber . Eventually the state returns to that indicated by .

Turning now to there is illustrated a side perspective view partly in section of one form of construction a single nozzle arrangement in greater detail. The nozzle arrangement includes a nozzle chamber which is normally filled with ink. Inside the nozzle chamber is a paddle actuator which divides the nozzle chamber from an ink refill supply channel which supplies ink from a back surface of a silicon wafer .

Outside of the nozzle chamber is located an actuator arm which includes a glass core portion and an external cupronickel portion . The actuator arm interconnects with the paddle by means of a slot located in one wall of the nozzle chamber . The slot is of small dimensions such that surface tension characteristics retain the ink within the nozzle chamber . Preferably the external portions of the arrangement are further treated so as to be strongly hydrophobic. Additionally a pit is provided around the slot . The pit includes a ledge with the pit and ledge interacting so as to minimize the opportunities for wicking along the actuator arm . Further to assist of minimizing of wicking the arm includes a thinned portion adjacent to the nozzle chamber in addition to a right angled wall .

The surface of the paddle actuator includes a slot . The slot aids in allowing for the flow of ink from the back surface of paddle actuator to a front surface. This is especially the case when initially the arrangement is filled with air and a liquid is injected into the refill channel . The dimensions of the slot are such that during operation of the paddle for ejecting drops minimal flow of fluid occurs through the slot .

The paddle actuator is housed within the nozzle chamber and is actuated so as to eject ink from the nozzle which in turn includes a rim . The rim assists in minimizing wicking across the top of the nozzle chamber .

The cupronickel element is interconnected through a post portion to a lower CMOS layer which provides for the electrical control of the actuator element.

Each nozzle arrangement can be constructed as part of an array of nozzles on a silicon wafer device and can be constructed from the utilizing semiconductor processing techniques in addition to micro machining and micro fabrication process technology MEMS and a full familiarity with these technologies is hereinafter assumed.

Turning initially to and in there is shown an initial processing step which utilizes a mask having a region as specified in . The initial starting material is preferably a silicon wafer having a standard 0.25 micron CMOS layer which includes drive electronics not shown the structure of the drive on electronics being readily apparent to those skilled in the art of CMOS integrated circuit designs.

The first step in the construction of a single nozzle is to pattern and etch a pit to a depth of 13 microns using the mask pattern having regions specified as illustrated in

Next as illustrated in a 3 micron layer of the sacrificial material is deposited. The sacrificial material can comprise aluminum. The sacrificial material is then etched utilizing a mask pattern having portions and as indicated at

Next as shown in a very thin 0.1 micron layer of a corrosion barrier material for example silicon nitride is deposited and subsequently etched so as to form the heater element . The etch utilizes a third mask having mask regions specified and in

Next as shown intended in a 1.1 micron layer of heater material which can comprise a 60 copper 40 nickel alloy is deposited utilizing a mask having a resultant mask region as illustrated in

Next a 0.1 micron corrosion layer is deposited over the surface. The corrosion barrier can again comprise silicon nitride.

Next as illustrated in a 3.4 micron layer of glass is deposited. The glass and nitride can then be etched utilizing a mask as specified in . The glass layer includes as part of the deposition process a portion which is a result of the deposition process following the lower surface profile.

Next a 6 m layer of sacrificial material such as aluminum is deposited as indicated in . This layer is planarized to approximately 4 micron minimum thickness utilizing a Chemical Mechanical Planarization CMP process. Next the sacrificial material layer is etched utilizing a mask having regions as illustrated in so as to form portions of the nozzle wall and post.

Next as illustrated in a 3 micron layer of glass is deposited. The 3 micron layer is patterned and etched to a depth of 1 micron using a mask having a region specified as illustrated in so as to form a nozzle rim.

Next as illustrated in the glass layer is etched utilizing a further mask as illustrated in which leaves glass portions e.g. to form the nozzle chamber wall and post portion .

Next as illustrated in the backside of the wafer is patterned and etched so as to form an ink supply channel . The mask utilized can have regions as specified in . The etch through the backside of the wafer can preferably utilize a high quality deep anisotropic etching system such as that available from Silicon Technology Systems of the United Kingdom. Preferably the etching process also results in the dicing of the wafer into its separate printheads at the same time.

Next as illustrated in the sacrificial material can be etched away so as to release the actuator structure. Upon release the actuator bends downwards due to its release from thermal stresses built up during deposition. The printhead can then be cleaned and mounted in a molded ink supply system for the supply of ink to the back surface of the wafer. A TAB film for supplying electric control to an edge of the printhead can then be bonded utilizing normal TAB bonding techniques. The surface area can then be hydrophobically treated and finally the ink supply channel and nozzle chamber filled with ink for testing.

Hence as illustrated in a pagewidth printhead having a repetitive structure can be constructed for full color printing. shows a portion of the final printhead structure and includes three separate groupings with one grouping for each color and each grouping e.g. in turn consisting of two separate rows of inkjet nozzles which are spaced apart in an interleaved pattern. The nozzle are fired at predetermined times so as to form an output image as would be readily understood by those skilled in the art of construction of inkjet printhead. Each nozzle e.g. includes its own actuator arm which in order to form an extremely compact arrangement is preferably formed so as to be generally bent with respect to the line perpendicular to the row of nozzles. Preferably a three color arrangement is provided which has one of the groups dedicated to cyan magenta and another yellow color printing. Obviously four color printing arrangements can be constructed if required.

Preferably at one side a series of bond pads e.g. are formed along the side for the insertion of a tape automated bonding TAB strip which can be aligned by means of alignment rail e.g. which is constructed along one edge of the printhead specifically for this purpose.

19. Connect the printheads to their interconnect systems. For a low profile connection with minimum disruption of airflow TAB may be used. Wire bonding may also be used if the printer is to be operated with sufficient clearance to the paper.

In a preferred embodiment there is provided a nozzle arrangement having a nozzle chamber containing ink and a thermal actuator connected to a paddle positioned within the chamber. The thermal actuator device is actuated so as to eject ink from the nozzle chamber. A preferred embodiment includes a particular thermal actuator which includes a series of tapered portions for providing conductive heating of a conductive trace. The actuator is connected to the paddle via an arm received through a slotted wall of the nozzle chamber. The actuator arm has a mating shape so as to mate substantially with the surfaces of the slot in the nozzle chamber wall.

Turning initially to there is provided schematic illustrations of the basic operation of a nozzle arrangement of the invention. A nozzle chamber is provided filled with ink by means of an ink inlet channel which can be etched through a wafer substrate on which the nozzle chamber rests. The nozzle chamber further includes an ink ejection port around which an ink meniscus forms.

Inside the nozzle chamber is a paddle type device which is interconnected to an actuator through a slot in the wall of the nozzle chamber . The actuator includes a heater means e.g. located adjacent to an end portion of a post . The post is fixed to a substrate.

When it is desired to eject a drop from the nozzle chamber as illustrated in the heater means is heated so as to undergo thermal expansion. Preferably the heater means itself or the other portions of the actuator are built from materials having a high bend efficiency where the bend efficiency is defined as

A suitable material for the heater elements is a copper nickel alloy which can be formed so as to bend a glass material.

The heater means is ideally located adjacent the end portion of the post such that the effects of activation are magnified at the paddle end such that small thermal expansions near the post result in large movements of the paddle end.

The heater means and consequential paddle movement causes a general increase in pressure around the ink meniscus which expands as illustrated in in a rapid manner. The heater current is pulsed and ink is ejected out of the port in addition to flowing in from the ink channel .

Subsequently the paddle is deactivated to again return to its quiescent position. The deactivation causes a general reflow of the ink into the nozzle chamber. The forward momentum of the ink outside the nozzle rim and the corresponding backflow results in a general necking and breaking off of the drop which proceeds to the print media. The collapsed meniscus results in a general sucking of ink into the nozzle chamber via the ink flow channel . In time the nozzle chamber is refilled such that the position in is again reached and the nozzle chamber is subsequently ready for the ejection of another drop of ink.

Firstly the actuator includes a series of tapered actuator units e.g. which comprise an upper glass portion amorphous silicon dioxide formed on top of a titanium nitride layer . Alternatively a copper nickel alloy layer hereinafter called cupronickel can be utilized which will have a higher bend efficiency where bend efficiency is defined as 

The titanium nitride layer is in a tapered form and as such resistive heating takes place near an end portion of the post . Adjacent titanium nitride glass portions are interconnected at a block portion which also provides a mechanical structural support for the actuator .

The heater means ideally includes a plurality of the tapered actuator unit which are elongate and spaced apart such that upon heating the bending force exhibited along the axis of the actuator is maximized. Slots are defined between adjacent tapered units and allow for slight differential operation of each actuator with respect to adjacent actuators .

The block portion is interconnected to an arm . The arm is in turn connected to the paddle inside the nozzle chamber by means of a slot e.g. formed in the side of the nozzle chamber . The slot is designed generally to mate with the surfaces of the arm so as to minimize opportunities for the outflow of ink around the arm . The ink is held generally within the nozzle chamber via surface tension effects around the slot .

When it is desired to actuate the arm a conductive current is passed through the titanium nitride layer via vias within the block portion connecting to a lower CMOS layer which provides the necessary power and control circuitry for the nozzle arrangement. The conductive current results in heating of the nitride layer adjacent to the post which results in a general upward bending of the arm and consequential ejection of ink out of the nozzle . The ejected drop is printed on a page in the usual manner for an inkjet printer as previously described.

An array of nozzle arrangements can be formed so as to create a single printhead. For example in there is illustrated a partly sectioned various array view which comprises multiple ink ejection nozzle arrangements of laid out in interleaved lines so as to form a printhead array. Of course different types of arrays can be formulated including full color arrays etc.

Fabrication of the ink jet nozzle arrangement is indicated in . A preferred embodiment achieves a particular balance between utilization of the standard semi conductor processing material such as titanium nitride and glass in a MEMS process. Obviously the skilled person may make other choices of materials and design features where the economics are justified. For example a copper nickel alloy of 50 copper and 50 nickel may be more advantageously deployed as the conductive heating compound as it is likely to have higher levels of bend efficiency. Also other design structures may be employed where it is not necessary to provide for such a simple form of manufacture.

In a preferred embodiment there is provided a nozzle chamber having ink within it and a thermal actuator device interconnected to a paddle the thermal actuator device being actuated so as to eject ink from the nozzle chamber. A preferred embodiment includes a particular thermal actuator structure which includes a tapered heater structure arm for providing positional heating of a conductive heater layer row. The actuator arm is connected to the paddle through a slotted wall in the nozzle chamber. The actuator arm has a mating shape so as to mate substantially with the surfaces of the slot in the nozzle chamber wall.

Turning initially to there is provided schematic illustrations of the basic operation of the device. A nozzle chamber is provided filled with ink by means of an ink inlet channel which can be etched through a wafer substrate on which the nozzle chamber rests. The nozzle chamber includes an ink ejection nozzle or aperture around which an ink meniscus forms.

Inside the nozzle chamber is a paddle type device which is connected to an actuator arm through a slot in the wall of the nozzle chamber . The actuator arm includes a heater means located adjacent to a post end portion of the actuator arm. The post is fixed to a substrate.

When it is desired to eject a drop from the nozzle chamber as illustrated in the heater means is heated so as to undergo thermal expansion. Preferably the heater means itself or the other portions of the actuator arm are built from materials having a high bend efficiency where the bend efficiency is defined as

A suitable material for the heater elements is a copper nickel alloy which can be formed so as to bend a glass material.

The heater means is ideally located adjacent the post end portion such that the effects of activation are magnified at the paddle end such that small thermal expansions near post result in large movements of the paddle end. The heating causes a general increase in pressure around the ink meniscus which expands as illustrated in in a rapid manner. The heater current is pulsed and ink is ejected out of the nozzle in addition to flowing in from the ink channel . Subsequently the paddle is deactivated to again return to its quiescent position. The deactivation causes a general reflow of the ink into the nozzle chamber. The forward momentum of the ink outside the nozzle rim and the corresponding backflow results in a general necking and breaking off of a drop which proceeds to the print media. The collapsed meniscus results in a general sucking of ink into the nozzle chamber via the in flow channel . In time the nozzle chamber is refilled such that the position in is again reached and the nozzle chamber is subsequently ready for the ejection of another drop of ink.

Turning now to there is illustrated a single nozzle arrangement of a preferred embodiment. The arrangement includes an actuator arm which includes a bottom layer which is constructed from a conductive material such as a copper nickel alloy hereinafter called cupronickel or titanium nitride TiN . The layer as will become more apparent hereinafter includes a tapered end portion near the end post . The tapering of the layer near this end means that any conductive resistive heating occurs near the post portion .

The layer is connected to the lower CMOS layers which are formed in the standard manner on a silicon substrate surface . The actuator arm is connected to an ejection paddle which is located within a nozzle chamber . The nozzle chamber includes an ink ejection nozzle from which ink is ejected and includes a convoluted slot arrangement which is constructed such that the actuator arm is able to move up and down while causing minimal pressure fluctuations in the area of the nozzle chamber around the slot .

The utilization of a second layer of the same material as the first layer allows for more accurate control of the actuator position as will be described with reference to . In there is illustrated the example where a high Young s modulus material is deposited utilizing standard semiconductor deposition techniques and on top of which is further deposited a second layer having a much lower Young s modulus. Unfortunately the deposition is likely to occur at a high temperature. Upon cooling the two layers are likely to have different coefficients of thermal expansion and different Young s modulus. Hence in ambient room temperature the thermal stresses are likely to cause bending of the two layers of material as shown at .

By utilizing a second deposition of the material having a high Young s Modulus the situation in is likely to result wherein the material is sandwiched between the two layers . Upon cooling the two layers are kept in tension with one another so as to result in a more planar structure regardless of the operating temperature. This principle is utilized in the deposition of the two layers of .

Turning again to one important attribute of a preferred embodiments includes the slotted arrangement . The slotted arrangement results in the actuator arm moving up and down thereby causing the paddle to also move up and down resulting in the ejection of ink. The slotted arrangement results in minimum ink outflow through the actuator arm connection and also results in minimal pressure increases in this area. The face of the actuator arm is extended out so as to form an extended interconnect with the paddle surface thereby providing for better attachment. The face is connected to a block portion which is provided to provide a high degree of rigidity. The actuator arm and the wall of the nozzle chamber have a general corrugated nature so as to reduce any flow of ink through the slot . The exterior surface of the nozzle chamber adjacent the block portion has a rim e.g. so to minimize wicking of ink outside of the nozzle chamber. A pit is also provided for this purpose. The pit is formed in the lower CMOS layers . An ink supply channel is provided by means of back etching through the wafer to the back surface of the nozzle.

18. Next the printheads can be individually mounted on attached molded plastic ink channels to supply ink to the ink supply channels.

19. The electrical control circuitry and power supply can then be bonded to an etch of the printhead with a TAB film.

20. Generally if necessary the surface of the printhead is then hydrophobized so as to ensure minimal wicking of the ink along external surfaces. Subsequent testing can determine operational characteristics.

Importantly as shown in the plan view of the heater element has a tapered portion adjacent the post so as to ensure maximum heating occurs near the post.

Of course different forms of inkjet printhead structures can be formed.

In a preferred embodiment ink is ejected out of a nozzle chamber via an ink ejection port as the result of the utilization of a series of radially positioned thermal actuator devices that are arranged around the ink ejection port and are activated so as to pressurize the ink within the nozzle chamber thereby causing ink ejection.

Turning now to and there is illustrated the basic operational principles of a preferred embodiment. illustrates a single nozzle arrangement in a quiescent state. The arrangement includes a nozzle chamber which is normally filled with ink to form a meniscus in an ink ejection port . The nozzle chamber is formed within a wafer . The nozzle chamber is in fluid communication with an ink supply channel which is etched through the wafer using a highly isotropic plasma etching system. A suitable etcher is the Advance Silicon Etch ASE system available from Surface Technology Systems of the United Kingdom.

The nozzle arrangement includes a series of radially positioned thermoactuator devices about the ink ejection port . These devices comprise a series of polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE actuators having an internal serpentine copper core which is positioned so that upon heating of the copper core the subsequent expansion of the surrounding Teflon results in a generally inward movement of radically outer edges of the actuators . Hence when it is desired to eject ink from the ink ejection nozzle a current is passed through the actuators which results in the bending as illustrated in . The bending movement of actuators results in a substantial increase in pressure within the nozzle chamber . The rapid increase in pressure in nozzle chamber in turn results in a rapid expansion of the meniscus as illustrated in .

The actuators are briefly activated only and subsequently deactivated so that the actuators rapidly return to their original positions as shown in . This results in a general inflow of ink and a necking and breaking of the meniscus resulting in the ejection of a drop . The necking and breaking of the meniscus is a consequence of a forward momentum of the ink of the drop and a negative pressure created as a result of the return of the actuators to their original positions. The return of the actuators also results in a general inflow of ink in the direction of an arrow so from the supply channel . Surface tension effects results in a return of the nozzle arrangement to the quiescent position as illustrated in .

Turning now to there is illustrated a side perspective view of one nozzle arrangement constructed in accordance with the principles previously outlined. The nozzle chamber is formed by an isotropic surface etch of the wafer . The wafer includes a CMOS layer including all the required power and drive circuits. Further the actuators are fabricated as a series of leaf or petal type actuators each having an internal copper or aluminum core which winds in a serpentine nature to provide for substantially unhindered expansion of the actuator device. The operation of the actuators is as described earlier with reference to and such that upon activation the petals bend inwardly as previously described. The ink supply channel is created with a deep silicon back edge of the wafers utilizing a plasma etcher or the like. The copper or aluminum coil defines a complete circuit. A central arm which includes both metal and PTFE portions provides main structural support for the actuators in addition to providing a current trace for the conductive elements.

Steps of the manufacture of the nozzle arrangement are described with reference to to . The nozzle arrangement is preferably constructed utilizing microelectromechanical MEMS techniques and can include the following construction techniques

Next as illustrated in a further 2 micron layer of PTFE is deposited and etched to a depth of 1 micron utilizing a nozzle rim mask so as to form a nozzle rim in addition to ink flow guide rails which inhibit wicking along the surface of the PTFE layer. The guide rails thin slots. Thus surface tension effects result in minimal outflow of ink during operation from the slots.

Next as illustrated in the PTFE is etched utilizing a nozzle and actuator mask to define an ejection nozzle port and slots and .

Next as illustrated in the wafer is crystallographically etched on a plane utilizing a standard crystallographic etchant such as KOH. The etching forms a chamber directly below the ink ejection port .

Next turning to the ink supply channel is etched from a back of the wafer utilizing a highly anisotropic etcher such as the STS etcher from Silicon Technology Systems of the United Kingdom. An array of ink jet nozzles can be formed simultaneously with a portion of the array being illustrated in . A portion of the printhead is formed simultaneously and diced by the STS etching process. The array shown provides for four column printing with each separate column attached to a different color ink supply channel which is supplied from the back of the wafer. Bond pads provide for electrical control of the ejection mechanism.

In this manner large pagewidth printheads can be formulated to provide for a drop on demand ink ejection mechanism.

One form of detailed manufacturing process which can be used to fabricate monolithic ink jet printheads operating in accordance with the principles taught by the present embodiment can proceed along the following steps

In a preferred embodiment ink is ejected out of a nozzle chamber via an ink ejection port using a series of radially positioned thermal actuator devices that are arranged about the ink ejection port and are activated to pressurize the ink within the nozzle chamber thereby causing the ejection of ink through the ejection port.

Turning now to and there is illustrated the basic operational principles of a preferred embodiment. illustrates a single nozzle arrangement in its quiescent state. The arrangement includes a nozzle chamber which is normally filled with ink so as to form a meniscus in an ink ejection port . The nozzle chamber is formed within a wafer . The nozzle chamber is supplied with ink via an ink supply channel which is etched through the wafer with a highly isotropic plasma etching system. A suitable etcher can be the Advance Silicon Etch ASE system available from Surface Technology Systems of the United Kingdom.

A top of the nozzle arrangement includes a series of radially positioned actuators . These actuators comprise a polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE layer and an internal serpentine copper core . Upon heating of the copper core the surrounding PTFE expands rapidly resulting in a generally downward movement of the actuators . Hence when it is desired to eject ink from the ink ejection port a current is passed through the actuators which results in them bending generally downwards as illustrated in . The downward bending movement of the actuators results in a substantial increase in pressure within the nozzle chamber . The increase in pressure in the nozzle chamber results in an expansion of the meniscus as illustrated in .

The actuators are activated only briefly and subsequently deactivated. Consequently the situation is as illustrated in with the actuators returning to their original positions. This results in a general inflow of ink back into the nozzle chamber and a necking and breaking of the meniscus resulting in the ejection of a drop . The necking and breaking of the meniscus is a consequence of the forward momentum of the ink associated with drop and the backward pressure experienced as a result of the return of the actuators to their original positions. The return of the actuators also results in a general inflow of ink from the channel as a result of surface tension effects and eventually the state returns to the quiescent position as illustrated in .

In there is illustrated a cross sectional perspective view of one embodiment of a nozzle arrangement constructed in accordance with the principles previously outlined. The nozzle chamber formed with an isotropic surface etch of the wafer . The wafer can include a CMOS layer including all the required power and drive circuits. Further the actuators each have a leaf or petal formation which extends towards a nozzle rim defining the ejection port . The normally inner end of each leaf or petal formation is displaceable with respect to the nozzle rim . Each activator has an internal copper core defining the element . The core winds in a serpentine manner to provide for substantially unhindered expansion of the actuators . The operation of the actuators is as illustrated in and such that upon activation the actuators bend as previously described resulting in a displacement of each petal formation away from the nozzle rim and into the nozzle chamber . The ink supply channel can be created via a deep silicon back etch of the wafer utilizing a plasma etcher or the like. The copper or aluminum core can provide a complete circuit. A central arm which can include both metal and PTFE portions provides the main structural support for the actuators .

Turning now to to one form of manufacture of the nozzle arrangement in accordance with the principles of a preferred embodiment is shown. The nozzle arrangement is preferably manufactured using microelectromechanical MEMS techniques and can include the following construction techniques 

As shown initially in the initial processing starting material is a standard semi conductor wafer having a complete CMOS level to a first level of metal. The first level of metal includes portions which are utilized for providing power to the thermal actuators .

The first step as illustrated in is to etch a nozzle region down to the silicon wafer utilizing an appropriate mask.

Next as illustrated in a 2 micron layer of polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE is deposited and etched so as to define vias for interconnecting multiple levels.

Next as illustrated in the second level metal layer is deposited masked and etched to define a heater structure . The heater structure includes via interconnected with a lower aluminum layer.

Next as illustrated in a further 2 micron layer of PTFE is deposited and etched to the depth of 1 micron utilizing a nozzle rim mask to define the nozzle rim in addition to ink flow guide rails which generally restrain any wicking along the surface of the PTFE layer. The guide rails surround small thin slots and as such surface tension effects are a lot higher around these slots which in turn results in minimal outflow of ink during operation.

Next as illustrated in the PTFE is etched utilizing a nozzle and actuator mask to define a port portion and slots and .

Next as illustrated in the wafer is crystallographically etched on a plane utilizing a standard crystallographic etchant such as KOH. The etching forms a chamber directly below the port portion .

In the ink supply channel can be etched from the back of the wafer utilizing a highly anisotropic etcher such as the STS etcher from Silicon Technology Systems of the United Kingdom. An array of ink jet nozzles can be formed simultaneously with a portion of an array being illustrated in . A portion of the printhead is formed simultaneously and diced by the STS etching process. The array shown provides for four column printing with each separate column attached to a different color ink supply channel being supplied from the back of the wafer. Bond pads provide for electrical control of the ejection mechanism.

In this manner large pagewidth printheads can be fabricated so as to provide for a drop on demand ink ejection mechanism.

One form of detailed manufacturing process which can be used to fabricate monolithic ink jet printheads operating in accordance with the principles taught by the present embodiment can proceed utilizing the following steps 

1. Using a double sided polished wafer complete a 0.5 micron one poly 2 metal CMOS process . This step is shown in . For clarity these diagrams may not be to scale and may not represent a cross section though any single plane of the nozzle. is a key to representations of various materials in these manufacturing diagrams and those of other cross referenced ink jet configurations.

10. Crystallographically etch the exposed silicon using KOH. This etch stops on crystallographic planes forming an inverted square pyramid with sidewall angles of 54.74 degrees. This step is shown in .

13. Connect the printheads to their interconnect systems. For a low profile connection with minimum disruption of airflow TAB may be used. Wire bonding may also be used if the printer is to be operated with sufficient clearance to the paper.

A preferred embodiment of the present invention discloses an inkjet printing device made up of a series of nozzle arrangements. Each nozzle arrangement includes a thermal surface actuator device which includes an L shaped cross sectional profile and an air breathing edge such that actuation of the paddle actuator results in a drop being ejected from a nozzle utilizing a very low energy level.

Turning initially to to there will now be described the operational principles of a preferred embodiment. In there is illustrated schematically a sectional view of a single nozzle arrangement which includes an ink nozzle chamber containing an ink supply which is resupplied by means of an ink supply channel . A nozzle rim is provided across which a meniscus forms with a slight bulge when in the quiescent state. A bend actuator device is formed on the top surface of the nozzle chamber and includes a side arm which runs generally parallel to the surface of the nozzle chamber wall so as to form an air breathing slot which assists in the low energy actuation of the bend actuator . Ideally the front surface of the bend actuator is hydrophobic such that a meniscus forms between the bend actuator and the surface leaving an air pocket in slot .

When it is desired to eject a drop via the nozzle rim the bend actuator is actuated so as to rapidly bend down as illustrated in . The rapid downward movement of the actuator results in a general increase in pressure of the ink within the nozzle chamber . This results in a outflow of ink around the nozzle rim and a general bulging of the meniscus . The meniscus undergoes a low amount of movement.

The actuator device is then turned off so as to slowly return to its original position as illustrated in . The return of the actuator to its original position results in a reduction in the pressure within the nozzle chamber which results in a general back flow of ink into the nozzle chamber . The forward momentum of the ink outside the nozzle chamber in addition to the back flow of ink results in a general necking and breaking off of the drop . Surface tension effects then draw further ink into the nozzle chamber via ink supply channel . Ink is drawn in the nozzle chamber until the quiescent position of is again achieved.

The actuator device can be a thermal actuator which is heated by means of passing a current through a conductive core. Preferably the thermal actuator is provided with a conductive core encased in a material such as polytetrafluoroethylene which has a high level coefficient of expansion. As illustrated in a conductive core is preferably of a serpentine form and encased within a material having a high coefficient of thermal expansion. Hence as illustrated in on heating of the conductive core the material expands to a greater extent and is therefore caused to bend down in accordance with requirements.

Turning now to there is illustrated a side perspective view partly in section of a single nozzle arrangement when in the state as described with reference to . The nozzle arrangement can be formed in practice on a semiconductor wafer utilizing standard MEMS techniques.

The silicon wafer preferably is processed so as to include a CMOS layer which can include the relevant electrical circuitry required for the full control of a series of nozzle arrangements formed so as to form a printhead unit. On top of the CMOS layer is formed a glass layer and an actuator which is driven by means of passing a current through a serpentine copper coil which is encased in the upper portions of a polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE layer . Upon passing a current through the coil the coil is heated as is the PTFE layer . PTFE has a very high coefficient of thermal expansion and hence expands rapidly. The coil constructed in a serpentine nature is able to expand substantially with the expansion of the PTFE layer . The PTFE layer includes a lip portion which upon expansion bends in a scooping motion as previously described. As a result of the scooping motion the meniscus generally bulges and results in a consequential ejection of a drop of ink. The nozzle chamber is later replenished by means of surface tension effects in drawing ink through an ink supply channel which is etched through the wafer through the utilization of a highly an isotropic silicon trench etcher. Hence ink can be supplied to the back surface of the wafer and ejected by means of actuation of the actuator . The gap between the side arm and chamber wall allows for a substantial breathing effect which results in a low level of energy being required for drop ejection.

A large number of arrangements of can be formed together on a wafer with the arrangements being collected into printheads which can be of various sizes in accordance with requirements. Turning now to there is illustrated one form of an array which is designed so as to provide three color printing with each color providing two spaced apart rows of nozzle arrangements . The three groupings can comprise groupings and with each grouping supplied with a separate ink color so as to provide for full color printing capability. Additionally a series of bond pads e.g. are provided for TAB bonding control signals to the printhead . Obviously the arrangement of illustrates only a portion of a printhead which can be of a length as determined by requirements.

One form of detailed manufacturing process which can be used to fabricate monolithic ink jet printheads operating in accordance with the principles taught by the present embodiment can proceed utilizing the following steps 

1. Using a double sided polished wafer complete drive transistors data distribution and timing circuits using a 0.5 micron one poly 2 metal CMOS process . Relevant features of the wafer at this step are shown in . For clarity these diagrams may not be to scale and may not represent a cross section though any single plane of the nozzle. is a key to representations of various materials in these manufacturing diagrams and those of other cross referenced ink jet configurations.

2. Etch the CMOS oxide layers down to silicon or second level metal using Mask 1. This mask defines the nozzle cavity and the edge of the chips. Relevant features of the wafer at this step are shown in .

12. Etch both layers of PTFE and the thin hydrophilic layer down to the sacrificial layer using Mask 6. This mask defines the gap at the edges of the actuator and paddle. This step is shown in .

13. Back etch through the silicon wafer to the sacrificial layer with for example an ASE Advanced Silicon Etcher from Surface Technology Systems using Mask 7. This mask defines the ink inlets which are etched through the wafer. This step is shown in .

15. Mount the printheads in their packaging which may be a molded plastic former incorporating ink channels which supply the appropriate color ink to the ink inlets at the back of the wafer.

16. Connect the printheads to their interconnect systems. For a low profile connection with minimum disruption of airflow TAB may be used. Wire bonding may also be used if the printer is to be operated with sufficient clearance to the paper.

In a preferred embodiment an ink jet print head is constructed from a series of nozzle arrangements where each nozzle arrangement includes a magnetic plate actuator which is actuated by a coil which is pulsed so as to move the magnetic plate and thereby cause the ejection of ink. The movement of the magnetic plate results in a leaf spring device being extended resiliently such that when the coil is deactivated the magnetic plate returns to a rest position resulting in the ejection of a drop of ink from an aperture created within the plate.

Turning initially to there is illustrated an ink jet nozzle arrangement which includes a nozzle chamber which connects with an ink ejection nozzle such that when in a quiescent position an ink meniscus forms over the nozzle . The nozzle is formed in a magnetic nozzle plate which can be constructed from a ferrous material. Attached to the nozzle plate is a series of leaf springs e.g. which bias the nozzle plate away from a base plate . Between the nozzle plate and the base plate there is provided a conductive coil which is interconnected and controlled via a lower circuitry layer which can comprise a standard CMOS circuitry layer. The ink chamber is supplied with ink from a lower ink supply channel which is formed by etching through a wafer substrate . The wafer substrate can comprise a semiconductor wafer substrate. The ink chamber is interconnected to the ink supply channel by means of a series of slots which can be etched through the CMOS layer .

The area around the coil is hydrophobically treated so that during operation a small meniscus e.g. forms between the nozzle plate and base plate .

When it is desired to eject a drop of ink the coil is energized. This results in a movement of the plate as illustrated in . The general downward movement of the plate results in a substantial increase in pressure within nozzle chamber . The increase in pressure results in a rapid growth in the meniscus as ink flows out of the nozzle chamber . The movement of the plate also results in the springs undergoing a general resilient extension. The small width of the slot results in minimal outflows of ink into the nozzle chamber .

Moments later as illustrated in the coil is deactivated resulting in a return of the plate towards its quiescent position as a result of the springs acting on the nozzle plate . The return of the nozzle plate to its quiescent position results in a rapid decrease in pressure within the nozzle chamber which in turn results in a general back flow of ink around the ejection nozzle . The forward momentum of the ink outside the nozzle plate and the back suction of the ink around the ejection nozzle results in a drop being formed and breaking off so as to continue to the print media.

The surface tension characteristics across the nozzle result in a general inflow of ink from the ink supply channel until such time as the quiescent position of is again reached. In this manner a coil actuated magnetic ink jet print head is formed for the adoption of ink drops on demand. Importantly the area around the coil is hydrophobically treated so as to expel any ink from flowing into this area.

Turning now to there is illustrated a side perspective view partly in section of a single nozzle arrangement constructed in accordance with the principles as previously outlined with respect to to . The arrangement includes a nozzle plate which is formed around an ink supply chamber and includes an ink ejection nozzle . A series of leaf spring elements are also provided which can be formed from the same material as the nozzle plate . A base plate also is provided for encompassing the coil . The wafer includes a series of slots for the wicking and flowing of ink into nozzle chamber with the nozzle chamber being interconnected via the slots with an ink supply channel . The slots are of a thin elongated form so as to provide for fluidic resistance to a rapid outflow of fluid from the chamber .

The coil is conductive interconnected at a predetermined portion not shown with a lower CMOS layer for the control and driving of the coil and movement of base plate . Alternatively the plate can be broken into two separate semi circular plates and the coil can have separate ends connected through one of the semi circular plates through to a lower CMOS layer.

Obviously an array of ink jet nozzle devices can be formed at a time on a single silicon wafer so as to form multiple printheads.

One form of detailed manufacturing process which can be used to fabricate monolithic ink jet print heads operating in accordance with the principles taught by the present embodiment can proceed utilizing the following steps 

1. Using a double sided polished wafer complete a 0.5 micron one poly 2 metal CMOS process . Due to high current densities both metal layers should be copper for resistance to electromigration.
