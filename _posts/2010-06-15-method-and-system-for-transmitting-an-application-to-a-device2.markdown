This application claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61 324 589 filed Apr. 15 2010 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The present disclosure relates to application delivery systems and more particularly to a method and system for transmitting an application from an application delivery server to a device.

Mobile communication devices may be designed in order to permit applications to be installed to provide additional functionality to such devices. For example such applications may include messaging applications media player applications games etc.

Mobile communication devices often permit users to download additional applications via wireless communication with an application delivery server.

The download of applications in this manner may in various systems be quite slow. Also in some situations the download of applications in this manner may be costly since it results in the consumption of wireless bandwidth.

Thus there exists a need to provide improved methods and systems for transmitting applications to devices such as mobile communication devices.

It will be noted that throughout the drawings and description similar features are identified by the same reference numerals.

The present disclosure describes a method for triggering a transmittal of an application to a device such as a mobile device or mobile communications device in which example embodiments are described herein connected to a host computer. The method comprises displaying in a web browser on the host computer a list of at least one application available for download to the device receiving instructions through the web browser to download the application to the device and in response to receiving instructions to download the application to the device i transmitting a request for the application to an application delivery server ii receiving the application from the application delivery server at the host computer and iii transmitting the application from the host computer to the device.

The present disclosure also describes a server comprising a memory storing a web application configured to display in a web browser on a host computer a list of at least one application available for download to a device receive instructions through the web browser to download the application to the device and in response to receiving instructions to download the application to the device i transmit a request for the application to an application delivery server ii receive the application from the application delivery server at the host computer and iii transmit the application from the host computer to the device.

Other example embodiments of the present application will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art from a review of the following detailed description in conjunction with the drawings.

Example embodiments of the present application are not limited to any particular operating system mobile device architecture server architecture or computer programming language.

In order to facilitate an understanding of one possible environment in which example embodiments described herein can operate reference is first made to which shows in block diagram form a communication system in which example embodiments of the present disclosure can be applied. The communication system includes a number of mobile communication devices which may be connected to the remainder of the system in any of several different ways. Accordingly several instances of mobile communication devices are depicted in employing different example ways of connecting to system . Mobile communication devices are connected to a wireless network which may include one or more of a Wireless Wide Area Network WWAN and a Wireless Local Area Network WLAN or other suitable network arrangements. In some example embodiments the mobile communication devices are configured to communicate over both the WWAN and WLAN and to roam between these networks. In some example embodiments the wireless network may include multiple WWANs and WLANs .

The WWAN may be implemented as any suitable wireless access network technology. By way of example but not limitation the WWAN may be implemented as a wireless network that includes a number of transceiver base stations one of which is shown in where each of the base stations provides wireless Radio Frequency RF coverage to a corresponding area or cell. The WWAN is typically operated by a mobile network service provider that provides subscription packages to users of the mobile communication devices . In some example embodiments the WWAN conforms to one or more of the following wireless network types Mobitex Radio Network DataTAC GSM Global System for Mobile Communication GPRS General Packet Radio System TDMA Time Division Multiple Access CDMA Code Division Multiple Access CDPD Cellular Digital Packet Data iDEN integrated Digital Enhanced Network EvDO Evolution Data Optimized CDMA2000 EDGE Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution UMTS Universal Mobile Telecommunication Systems HSPDA High Speed Downlink Packet Access IEEE 802.16e also referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or WiMAX or various other networks. Although WWAN is described as a Wide Area network that term is intended herein also to incorporate wireless Metropolitan Area Networks WMAN and other similar technologies for providing coordinated service wirelessly over an area larger than that covered by typical WLANs.

The WWAN may further include a wireless network gateway which connects the mobile communication devices to transport facilities and through the transport facilities to a wireless connector system . Transport facilities may include one or more private networks or lines the public Internet a virtual private network or any other suitable network. The wireless connector system may be operated for example by an organization or enterprise such as a corporation university or governmental department which allows access to a network such as an internal or enterprise network and its resources or the wireless connector system may be operated by a mobile network provider. In some example embodiments the network may be realized using the Internet rather than an internal or enterprise network.

The wireless network gateway provides an interface between the wireless connector system and the WWAN which facilitates communication between the mobile communication devices and other devices not shown connected directly or indirectly to the WWAN . Accordingly communications sent via the mobile communication devices are transported via the WWAN and the wireless network gateway through transport facilities to the wireless connector system . Communications sent from the wireless connector system are received by the wireless network gateway and transported via the WWAN to the mobile communication devices .

The WLAN includes a wireless network which in some example embodiments conforms to IEEE 802.11x standards sometimes referred to as Wi Fi such as for example the IEEE 802.11a 802.11b and or 802.11g standard. Other communication protocols may be used for the WLAN in other example embodiments such as for example IEEE 802.11n IEEE 802.16e also referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or WiMAX or IEEE 802.20 also referred to as Mobile Wireless Broadband Access . The WLAN includes one or more wireless RF Access Points AP one of which is shown in that collectively provide a WLAN coverage area.

The WLAN may be a personal network of the user an enterprise network or a hotspot offered by an Internet service provider ISP a mobile network provider or a property owner in a public or semi public area for example. The access points are connected to an access point AP interface which may connect to the wireless connector system directly for example if the access point is part of an enterprise WLAN in which the wireless connector system resides or indirectly via the transport facilities if the access point is a personal Wi Fi network or Wi Fi hotspot in which case a mechanism for securely connecting to the wireless connector system such as a virtual private network VPN may be used . The AP interface provides translation and routing services between the access points and the wireless connector system to facilitate communication directly or indirectly with the wireless connector system .

The wireless connector system may be implemented as one or more servers and is typically located behind a firewall . The wireless connector system manages communications including email communications to and from a set of managed mobile communication devices . The wireless connector system also provides administrative control and management capabilities over users and mobile communication devices which may connect to the wireless connector system .

The wireless connector system allows the mobile communication devices to access the network and connected resources and services such as a messaging server for example a Microsoft Exchange IBM Lotus Domino or Novell GroupWise email server and a content server for providing content such as Internet content or content from an organization s internal servers and application servers for implementing server based applications such as instant messaging IM applications to mobile communication devices .

The wireless connector system typically provides a secure exchange of data e.g. email messages personal information manager PIM data and IM data with the mobile communication devices . In some example embodiments communications between the wireless connector system and the mobile communication devices are encrypted. In some example embodiments communications are encrypted using a symmetric encryption key implemented using Advanced Encryption Standard AES or Triple Data Encryption Standard Triple DES encryption. Private encryption keys are generated in a secure two way authenticated environment and are used for both encryption and decryption of data. In some example embodiments the private encryption key is stored only in the user s mailbox on the messaging server and on the mobile communication device and can typically be regenerated by the user on mobile communication devices . Data sent to the mobile communication devices is encrypted by the wireless connector system using the private encryption key retrieved from the user s mailbox. The encrypted data when received on the mobile communication devices is decrypted using the private encryption key stored in memory. Similarly data sent to the wireless connector system from the mobile communication devices is encrypted using the private encryption key stored in the memory of the mobile communication device . The encrypted data when received on the wireless connector system is decrypted using the private encryption key retrieved from the user s mailbox.

The wireless network gateway is adapted to send data packets received from the mobile communication device over the WWAN to the wireless connector system . The wireless connector system then sends the data packets to the appropriate connection point such as the messaging server content server application delivery server or application servers . Conversely the wireless connector system sends data packets received for example from the messaging server content server application delivery server or application servers to the wireless network gateway which then transmit the data packets to the destination mobile communication device . The AP interfaces of the WLAN provide similar sending functions between the mobile communication device the wireless connector system and network connection point such as the messaging server content server application delivery server and application server .

The network may include a private local area network metropolitan area network wide area network the public Internet or combinations thereof and may include virtual networks constructed using any of these alone or in combination.

A link may be provided for exchanging information between the mobile communication device and a host computer connected to a network such as the Internet. The link may include one or both of a physical interface and short range wireless communication interface. The physical interface may include one or combinations of an Ethernet connection Universal Serial Bus USB connection Firewire also known as an IEEE 1394 interface connection or other serial data connection via respective ports or interfaces of the mobile communication device and host computer . In one example embodiment the link is a USB connection to the mobile communication device .

The host computer has access to a web based or Internet based application delivery server interface through an Internet browser on the host computer . The Internet browser also known as a web browser on the host computer may access the web based application delivery server interface by establishing a hypertext transfer protocol HTTP connection or hypertext transfer protocol secure HTTPS connection to the web based application delivery server interface which is comprised of a web server accessible through the Internet. The web server includes memory which has stored thereon a web based application store application .

The web based application delivery server interface may provide the web based application store application to the Internet browser on the host computer . The web based application store application permits users to download applications from an application delivery server to a device connected to the host computer via the link . The web based application store application is a web based client for end users which is described in greater detail below. In some example embodiments the application store application may provide functions or features in addition to or instead of the ability to purchase and download applications to the device . In some example embodiments the web based application store application may provide other device management functions. In such example embodiments the web based application store application may also be referred to as a web based application management application.

In some example embodiments such as the example embodiment shown in the web based application delivery server interface and the application delivery server may be separate servers. These servers and may be connected either directly or through a network .

In other example embodiments the functions of the web based application delivery server interface and the application delivery server may be performed on a common server. In either case the application delivery server may be accessed either directly or indirectly by a web based application store application which is run through an Internet browser on the host computer . The web based application store application may be received for example by the host computer when the Internet browser on the host computer navigates to a location associated with the web based application delivery server interface. For example the Internet browser may navigate to the web based application delivery server interface using a uniform resource locator URL associated with the web based application delivery server interface .

The application delivery server is configured to deliver applications to the mobile devices upon request by the host computer . Applications are programs that include instructions for the mobile device which provide a user of the mobile device with tools to accomplish a task. By way of non limiting example the applications may include word processor applications media player applications database applications games etc. The application delivery server may be configured to act as a remote storage facility for the mobile device to permit users of the mobile communication devices to re download applications that were previously downloaded purchased and or otherwise acquired. In at least some example embodiments the application delivery server acts as or interfaces with an application data backup server which is configured to store application data . Application data is data which is used by an application and which is generally user or device specific data. The application data may in various example embodiments include user settings or preferences associated with an application user achievements i.e. high scores associated with a game etc. The application data is in at least some example embodiments configured or created by a user of the mobile device or by the mobile device itself.

The host computer typically comprises a controller having at least processor i.e. microprocessor for controlling its operation a communications subsystem connected to the processor for communicating with the communication system a display screen or monitor connected to the processor one or more user input devices such as a keyboard and mouse connected to the processor for sending user input signals to the processor in response to user inputs a memory or storage element connected to the processor such as a hard disk drive HDD RAM ROM and or other suitable memory connected to the processor and other suitable input and output devices not shown as desired or required. The memory has data and instructions stored thereon for configuring the processor and host computer . Operating system software software applications and data used by the processor are stored in the memory. The software and data configure the operation of the host computer . Other features of the host computer for implementing the processes and functions described herein will be appreciated by persons ordinarily skilled in the art.

It will be appreciated that the above described communication system is provided for the purpose of illustration only and that the above described communication system includes one possible communication network configuration of a multitude of possible configurations for use with the mobile communication devices . The teachings of the present disclosure may be employed in connection with other types of networks and associated devices that are effective in implementing or facilitating wireless communication. Suitable variations of the communication system will be understood to a person of skill in the art and are intended to fall within the scope of the present disclosure.

Reference is now made to which illustrates a mobile communication device in which example embodiments described in the present disclosure can be applied. The mobile communication device is a two way communication device having at least data and possibly also voice communication capabilities and the capability to communicate with other computer systems for example via the Internet. Depending on the functionality provided by the mobile communication device in various example embodiments the mobile communications device may be a data communication device a multiple mode communication device configured for both data and voice communication a smartphone a mobile telephone or a PDA personal digital assistant enabled for wireless communication or a computer system with a wireless modem. The mobile communications device may also be referred to as a mobile device and in some cases as a device .

The mobile communication device includes a controller including at least one processor such as a microprocessor which controls the overall operation of the mobile communication device and a wireless communication subsystem for exchanging radio frequency signals with the wireless network . The processor interacts with the communication subsystem which performs communication functions. The processor interacts with additional device subsystems. In some example embodiments the mobile device may include a touchscreen display which includes a display screen such as a liquid crystal display LCD screen with a touch sensitive input surface or overlay connected to an electronic controller . The touch sensitive overlay and the electronic controller act as an input mechanism to provide a touch sensitive input device. The processor also interacts with the touch sensitive overlay via the electronic controller . In other example embodiments the display may not be a touchscreen display. Instead the mobile device may simply include a non touch display and one or more input mechanisms such as for example a depressible scroll wheel or other control keys .

The processor interacts with additional device subsystems including flash memory random access memory RAM read only memory ROM auxiliary input output I O subsystems data port such as serial data port such as a Universal Serial Bus USB data port speaker microphone control keys switch short range communication subsystem and other device subsystems generally designated as . Some of the subsystems shown in perform communication related functions whereas other subsystems may provide resident or on device functions.

The communication subsystem includes a receiver a transmitter and associated components such as one or more antenna elements and local oscillators LOs and a processing module such as a digital signal processor DSP . The antenna elements and may be embedded or internal to the mobile communication device and a single antenna may be shared by both receiver and transmitter as is known in the art. As will be apparent to those skilled in the field of communication the particular design of the communication subsystem depends on the wireless network in which the mobile communication device is intended to operate.

The mobile communication device may communicate with any one of a plurality of fixed transceiver base stations of the wireless network within its geographic coverage area. The mobile communication device may send and receive communication signals over the wireless network after a network registration or activation procedures have been completed. Signals received by the antenna through the wireless network are input to the receiver which may perform such common receiver functions as signal amplification frequency down conversion filtering channel selection etc. as well as analog to digital A D conversion. A D conversion of a received signal allows more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding to be performed in the DSP . In a similar manner signals to be transmitted are processed including modulation and encoding for example by the DSP . These DSP processed signals are input to the transmitter for digital to analog D A conversion frequency up conversion filtering amplification and transmission to the wireless network via the antenna . The DSP not only processes communication signals but may also provide for receiver and transmitter control. For example the gains applied to communication signals in the receiver and the transmitter may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP .

The processor operates under stored program control and executes software modules stored in memory such as persistent memory for example in the flash memory . As illustrated in the software modules include operating system software software applications which include an application store client .

The application store client is configured to operate in a first operating mode in which it interfaces with a web based application store application on the host computer . In the first operating mode the application store client receives commands from the web based application store application on the host computer . The commands are related to the management of applications on the device . In this mode the device may operate without direct input from a user on the device . That is the user may control the host computer through the web based application store application operating in an Internet browser. As will be explained in greater detail below the web based application store application may interact with a plug in to send data to the device and to receive data from the device . Such data may include the commands related to the management of applications on the device .

The commands received by the application store client from the host computer may be instructions to among other things store a received application on the device which may be referred to as a storage command install a received application to the device which may be referred to as an installation command delete an application from the device which may be referred to as a delete command send device configuration information or other requested information from the device to the host computer provide installation status information to the host computer reset the device which may be referred to as a reset command etc.

The application store client is configured to perform an associated function upon receiving a command from the host computer . For example in at least some example embodiments the application store client is configured to receive a command from the host computer to install an application i.e. an installation command to the device . In response to receiving an installation command the application store client is configured to install that application to the device . Similarly in response to receiving a command to delete an application from the device i.e. a delete command the application store client may delete that application from the device .

Similarly in response to receiving a request for device configuration information the application store client may transfer device configuration information to the host computer . The device configuration information may in various example embodiments include information specifying any one or more of the following a unique identification number such as a PIN associated with the device a version number of an operating system or another software application stored on the device such as for example the application store client memory usage information such as information quantifying the free memory on the device and or information identifying applications installed on the device . Other device configuration information is also possible.

Similarly in response to receiving a request for installation status information or in response to receiving a command to install an application on the device the application store client may provide installation status information to the host computer to update the host computer as to the status of the installation. Such installation status information may include for example a quantifier as to the progress of the installation for example in terms of percentage complete time remaining etc .

In response to receiving a command to reset the device i.e. a reset command the application store client may cause the device to be reset. In some embodiments resetting the device may include performing a power cycle on the device .

The application store client may in some example embodiments be configured to operate in a second operating mode in which it is configured to interact directly with the application delivery server without engaging the web based application delivery server interface or the host computer . That is the application store client may in the second operating mode communicate with the application delivery server through the WWAN or WLAN . The second operating mode may be useful when the device is not connected to a host computer .

In the second operating mode a user of the mobile communication device may request an application from the application delivery server by interacting with the application store client on the mobile device for example by using the touchscreen display control keys or other input mechanism. In response to receiving a request to download an application from the user the application store client of the mobile communication device may transmit a download request to the application delivery server over the WWAN or WLAN . The application store client may then wait for the application delivery server to transmit the specified application to the mobile device over the WWAN or WLAN . The mobile device then receives the application from the application delivery server .

The second operating mode may include a graphical user interface which is displayed on the display of the mobile device which provides an interface to users of the mobile device which permits users to browse or search for applications available on the application delivery server .

In the first operating mode the application store client operates in a more passive role than in the second operating mode. That is in the first operating mode users browse for select and otherwise manage applications through an input mechanism associated with the host computer . The host computer downloads applications through the application delivery server and transfers such applications to the device . In contrast in the second operating mode the application store client allows users to interact with the application delivery server directly from the mobile device . That is in the second operating mode the application store client provides a graphical user interface on the device which allows users of the device to browse for select and otherwise manage applications. In this second operating mode the application store client communicates directly with the application delivery server through the WLAN or WWAN .

It will be appreciated that in some example embodiments an efficiency is realized by providing the first operating mode functions of the application store client i.e. the ability to execute the functions described herein in response to receiving commands from the host computer and the second operating mode functions of the application store client i.e. the ability to interact with the application delivery server directly in a common application since many of the functions that are performed on the device are common in either operating mode. For example in both operating modes the application store client may be configured to receive a command to install an application i.e. an installation command and in response to begin the installation of that application.

However it will be appreciated that in other example embodiments the functions described herein may be split into multiple applications each performing a subset of the functions of the application store client .

The application store client may in some example embodiments include a remote storage module which is configured to permit applications which have been removed from the device to be reinstalled to the device following their removal. In at least some example embodiments when an application is removed from the mobile device for example when it is deleted by the user or in response to receiving a delete command from the host computer application data associated with that application may be transmitted to a remote server such as the application delivery server . This transfer may be done either directly i.e. through the WWAN or WLAN or may be done via the host computer . The application delivery server may store the application data in a memory . In some example embodiments the application data may be retrieved from the server and restored on the mobile device if and when the application is retrieved.

In some example embodiments the remote storage module is configured to interact with the application delivery server to provide remote storage capabilities for the mobile device.

In some example embodiments where the application store client is configured to operate in the second operating mode i.e. where it provides a graphical user interface allowing the user to interact with the application delivery server from the device itself the remote storage module may be configured to transmit identification information to the application delivery server . The remote storage capabilities may be related to either a user account or in some example embodiments a specific device. The identification information may in some example embodiments identify the mobile device . For example the identification information may be the Personal Identification Number PIN associated with the mobile device . In other example embodiments the identification information may identify a user or account associated with the mobile device . For example the identification information may include one or more of a username and or password log in information associated with the user or account a unique identification number associated with the user or account and or an email address associated with the user or account.

The application delivery server may determine from the identification data any applications that are available for re download and may transmit data identifying those applications to the mobile device .

The applications which are said to be available for re download may in some example embodiments be applications which were previously downloaded by either the mobile device or by another mobile device associated with the same user i.e. applications which the user and or device has rights to by virtue of a prior purchase and or download . In some example embodiments the applications which are said to be available for re download are applications which the user of the mobile device has previously purchased.

The remote storage module of the mobile device may be configured to display on the display screen data received from the application delivery server which identifies at least one application available for re download. For example it may display data identifying one or more previously downloaded application which is available for re download to the mobile device . The displayed data may be presented in a list format in some example embodiments. The list may include two or more applications which are available for re download to the mobile device .

In some example embodiments a user may request that an application be re downloaded to the mobile device using an input mechanism associated with the mobile device for example the touchscreen display or the control keys . The user may navigate through a display screen containing a plurality of applications available for re download to a desired application available for re downloading and select a download or other option to initiate the re downloading of the application.

Upon receiving a user input to re download an application the remote storage module of the application store client transmits a request to the application delivery server to request the delivery of the application. The request includes an identifier such as a product number associated with the application which permits the application delivery server to determine the application that the request relates to. The application delivery server may then cause the application to be transmitted and the application is received at the mobile communication device. In some example embodiments the application may be automatically installed following its receipt.

The remote storage module may in some example embodiments be launched from within the application store client when the application store client is operating in the second operating mode. That is the user may load the application store client and may select an option to load the remote storage module portion of the application store client . For example the user may select an option entitled Digital Storage Locker Remote Applications Previously Downloaded Applications or My World or an option with another similar descriptor. In other example embodiments the remote storage module may be a stand alone component that is operationally separate from the application store client and that is loadable by selecting an appropriate icon in an icon grid on a home page associated with the mobile device .

The application store client and the remote storage module may among other things be implemented through stand alone software applications or combined together in one or more of the operating system and applications . In some example embodiments the functions performed by the above identified applications may be realized as a plurality of independent elements rather than a single integrated element and any one or more of these elements may be implemented as parts of other software applications.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the software modules or parts thereof may be temporarily loaded into volatile memory such as the RAM . The RAM is used for storing runtime data variables and other types of data or information as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Although specific functions are described for various types of memory this is merely one example and those skilled in the art will appreciate that a different assignment of functions to types of memory could also be used.

The software applications may include a range of other applications including for example an address book application a messaging application a calendar application and or a notepad application. In some example embodiments the software applications include an email message application a push content viewing application a voice communication i.e. telephony application a map application and a media player application. Each of the software applications may include layout information defining the placement of particular fields and graphic elements e.g. text fields input fields icons etc. in the user interface i.e. the display device according to the application.

In some example embodiments the auxiliary input output I O subsystems may include an external communication link or interface for example an Ethernet connection. The mobile communication device may include other wireless communication interfaces for communicating with other types of wireless networks for example a wireless network such as an orthogonal frequency division multiplexed OFDM network or a GPS transceiver for communicating with a GPS satellite network not shown . The auxiliary I O subsystems may include a vibrator for providing vibratory notifications in response to various events on the mobile communication device such as receipt of an electronic communication or incoming phone call or for other purposes such as haptic feedback touch feedback .

In some example embodiments the mobile communication device also includes a removable memory module typically including flash memory such as a removable memory card and a memory interface . Network access may be associated with a subscriber or user of the mobile communication device via the memory module which may be a Subscriber Identity Module SIM card for use in a GSM network or other type of memory card for use in the relevant wireless network type. The memory module is inserted in or connected to the memory card interface of the mobile communication device in order to operate in conjunction with the wireless network .

The mobile communication device stores data in an erasable persistent memory which in one example embodiment is the flash memory . In various example embodiments the data includes service data including information required by the mobile communication device to establish and maintain communication with the wireless network . The data may also include user application data such as email messages address book and contact information calendar and schedule information notepad documents image files and other commonly stored user information stored on the mobile communication device by its user and other data. The data stored in the persistent memory e.g. flash memory of the mobile communication device may be organized at least partially into a number of databases each containing data items of the same data type or associated with the same application. For example email messages contact records and task items may be stored in individual databases within the mobile device memory. The application data may include application data which is associated with a specific application. For example an application which is a game may have associated application data specifying high scores etc.

In some example embodiments the data may include identification data such as a Personal Identification Number PIN identifying either the user or the mobile device. In some example embodiments the PIN is a unique identifier assigned to the mobile communication device during manufacturing of that device . The PIN may be saved in non volatile memory so that the mobile device will retain the PIN even when it is powered off. In some example embodiments the identification data such as the PIN may be transmitted to the application delivery server as part of the purchase download or re download method associated with the delivery and or subsequent re delivery of an application from the application delivery server to the mobile communication device .

The serial data port may be used for synchronization with a user s host computer and for interacting with a web based application store application on the host computer .

In some example embodiments the mobile communication device is provided with a service routing application programming interface API which provides an application with the ability to route traffic through a serial data i.e. USB or Bluetooth Bluetooth is a registered trademark of Bluetooth SIG Inc. connection to the host computer system using standard connectivity protocols. When a user connects their mobile communication device to the host computer system via a USB cable or Bluetooth connection traffic that was destined for the wireless network is automatically routed to the mobile communication device using the USB cable or Bluetooth connection. Similarly any traffic destined for the wireless network is automatically sent over the USB cable Bluetooth connection to the host computer system for processing.

The mobile communication device also includes a battery as a power source which is typically one or more rechargeable batteries that may be charged for example through charging circuitry coupled to a battery interface such as the serial data port . The battery provides electrical power to at least some of the electrical circuitry in the mobile communication device and the battery interface provides a mechanical and electrical connection for the battery . The battery interface is coupled to a regulator not shown which provides power V to the circuitry of the mobile communication device .

The short range communication subsystem is an additional optional component which provides for communication between the mobile communication device and different systems or devices which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example the subsystem may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components or a wireless bus protocol compliant communication mechanism such as a Bluetooth communication module to provide for communication with similarly enabled systems and devices.

A predetermined set of applications that control basic device operations including data and possibly voice communication applications will normally be installed on the mobile communication device during or after manufacture. Additional applications and or upgrades to the operating system or software applications may also be loaded onto the mobile communication device through the wireless network the auxiliary I O subsystem the data port the short range communication subsystem or other suitable subsystem other wireless communication interfaces. The downloaded applications or code modules may be permanently installed for example written into the program memory i.e. the flash memory or written into and executed from the RAM for execution by the processor at runtime. Such flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of the mobile communication device and may provide enhanced on device functions communication related functions or both. For example secure communication applications may enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using the mobile communication device .

The mobile communication device may provide two principal modes of communication a data communication mode and an optional voice communication mode. In the data communication mode a received data signal such as a text message an email message or Web page download will be processed by the communication subsystem and input to the processor for further processing. For example a downloaded Web page may be further processed by a browser application or an email message may be processed by an email message application and output to the display . A user of the mobile communication device may also compose data items such as email messages for example using the touch sensitive overlay in conjunction with the display device and possibly the control buttons and or the auxiliary I O subsystems . These composed items may be transmitted through the communication subsystem over the wireless network .

In the voice communication mode the mobile communication device provides telephony functions and operates as a typical cellular phone. The overall operation is similar except that the received signals would be output to the speaker and signals for transmission would be generated by a transducer such as the microphone . The telephony functions are provided by a combination of software firmware i.e. the voice communication module and hardware i.e. the microphone the speaker and input devices . Alternative voice or audio I O subsystems such as a voice message recording subsystem may also be implemented on the mobile communication device . Although voice or audio signal output is typically accomplished primarily through the speaker the display device may also be used to provide an indication of the identity of a calling party duration of a voice call or other voice call related information.

Referring now to a web based application store application in accordance with one example embodiment of the present disclosure will now be described. The web based application store application is a web based client interface which allows users to download applications to their mobile communication devices or in some example embodiments otherwise manage applications on their mobile communication devices . The web based application store application works in conjunction with the application delivery server .

The application delivery server is a server side component which processes and manages server side web based application store application tasks. The web based application store application provides users with the ability to perform a controlled set of self serve operations. Depending on the embodiment the web based application store application allows device users to i browse for applications available through the application delivery server ii retrieve applications available through the application delivery server iii send applications available through the application delivery server to the device iv retrieve from the application delivery server applications previously downloaded to the device or a device associated with the same user which have since been deleted from that device and or iv delete applications on the device . Other features and functions may be provided in addition to or instead of the features and functions listed above.

The web based application store application may be accessed from a host computer having an Internet connection and any necessary communication component installed i.e. any communication interfaces and device communication stack components .

Referring again to the communications infrastructure utilized by the web based application store application to communicate with the mobile communication device in accordance with one example embodiment of the present disclosure will now be described.

The web based application store application may be implemented in Dynamic HTML Hypertext Markup Language DHTML via a series of web page s displayed in an Internet browser running on the computer . The DHTML of the web page s is provided by markup document s written in DHTML which are retrieved by an HTTP server or Internet server such as the web based application delivery server interface in response to a direct or indirect request from the computer e.g. by an HTTP request to access or Go to a respective URL or web address . The Internet browser communicates with a mobile communication device via a device manager

The device manager in turn communicates with connected mobile communication devices via device drivers . The device drivers are typically device drivers for a USB device. A USB Device is a device that uses USB as the physical transport layer for wireline communications with the host computer . USB devices are connected to a USB port on the host computer or a USB hub that is connected to a USB port on the host computer . USB device drivers are installed in the operating system of the computer in order to enable wireline communications to a USB device.

It will be appreciated however that other device drivers are possible for communicating with devices using other protocols. For example in some example embodiments a serial device driver may be provided for communicating with serial devices. Similarly in other example embodiments a Bluetooth device driver may be provided for communicating with Bluetooth enabled devices. A serial device is a device that uses RS 232 Recommended Standard 232 serial communications as the physical transport layer for wireline communications with the computer. Serial devices are connected to a serial port on the host computer for example through a cradle accessory. Serial device drivers are installed in the operating system of the computer in order to enable wireline communications to a serial device. Typically serial device drivers are provided with the operating system of the computer and need not be installed by the web based application store application .

The device manager is a program or program module which manages application level wireline access to connected mobile devices and or possibly Bluetooth or other short range wireless access to connected mobile devices . The device manager provides a service routing application programming interface API which provides applications such as the web based application store application with the ability to route traffic through the serial data connection for example USB or Bluetooth connection to the computer using standard connectivity protocols. The device manager also provides a number of device related communication services in addition to serial or Bluetooth data bypass connection functionality. The communication services provided to the web based application store application by the device manager include the notification of device attach and detach events tracking of serial bypass Bluetooth statistics and device communications multiplexing.

The Internet browser is equipped with a scripting engine to run client side scripts such as a JavaScript scripting engine for running JavaScript within the DHTML web page s of the web based application store application . As will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art JavaScript is a scripting language used in client side web document for example in web pages. The DHTML web pages include JavaScript code scripts which interact with the Document Object Model DOM of the DHTML web pages. The JavaScript engine of the Internet browser also known as JavaScript interpreter or JavaScript implementation is an interpreter that interprets JavaScript scripts embedded in or included from DHTML pages and executes the scripts accordingly. The Internet browser provides a runtime environment for the JavaScript engine and typically uses the public API application programming interface to create objects and methods through which the JavaScript scripts can interact with external processes and devices. Within the JavaScript runtime environment objects and data may be shared between the JavaScript engine and the other components of the Internet browser . In other example embodiments other scripting languages may be used such as for example Visual Basic for Applications VBA VBScript and Visual Basic .NET all from Microsoft Corporation.

The Internet browser may be Internet Explorer by Microsoft Corporation FireFox by Mozilla Corporation or any other Internet browser having the necessary capabilities for implementing the functions described herein. In one example embodiment the host computer runs a Windows operating system by Microsoft Corporation .

As will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art dynamic HTML is a collection of technologies used to create interactive and animated web sites by using a combination a static markup language such as HTML a client side scripting language such as JavaScript a presentation definition language such as Cascading Style Sheets CSS and the Document Object Model. A DHTML web page is any web page in which client side scripting changes variables of the presentation definition language which in turn affects the appearance and function of otherwise static HTML page content after the page has been fully loaded and during the viewing process. Thus an DHTML web page is dynamic in that its contents and function changes while the web page is being viewed not in its ability to generate a unique web page with each page load. This is in contrast to the broader concept of a dynamic web page which is any web page generated differently for each user load occurrence or specific variable values. This includes web pages created by client side or server side scripting where the content is determined prior to being viewed within the Internet browser . Dynamic web pages lack the ability to affect contents or function changes while a web page is being viewed.

To implement some of the functionality of the web based application store application the Internet browser communicates with the connected mobile communication devices and has native communication with the connected mobile communication devices .

The Internet browser uses a Scripting language Capable Compatible SC device controller to interface the JavaScript engine of the Internet browser with a device communications stack the device manager and device driver of the mobile communication device . The SC device controller is a device controller which is compatible with and which provides communications services to a scripting engine of an Internet browser. In particular the SC device controller provides communications services to the JavaScript layer of the DHTML web page s comprising notifying of device attach and detach events sending and receiving data to connected devices. Any other communications services which require native control by the JavaScript layer of the DHTML web page s may be performed by the SC device controller . In some example embodiments for example embodiments in which the Internet browser is Internet Explorer the SC device controller is implemented in whole or in part using one or more ActiveX Controls. ActiveX controls are a Microsoft COM Component Object Model based technology for extending the functionality of Internet browsers with third party native code extensions.

In other example embodiments such as example embodiments in which the Internet browser does not support ActiveX controls such as for example FireFox the SC device controller may be implemented through a Netscape Plug in Application Programming Interface NPAPI plug in.

In either case the SC device controller and possibly the device manager may be a plug in which is used to extend the function of the Internet browser. The plug in may provide the functions of the SC device controller and in some example embodiments the device manager .

The SC device controller provides the DHTML web page content hosted in the Internet browser with a mechanism to interact with the mobile communication devices connected to the computer . The SC device controller e.g. ActiveX control is instantiated within the Internet browser process which exposes COM Component Object Model interfaces to permit the JavaScript scripting engine of the Internet browser to interact with connected devices and to perform other client side operations using native code.

Although the device drivers and device manager have been described as separate communication components within the device communications stack of the mobile communication device it will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the functions implemented by these communication components may be combined within a single communication component in other example embodiments and possibly combined with the SC device controller in some example embodiments.

Referring now to the web based application store application will be discussed in greater detail. illustrate methods for triggering a transmittal of an application to a device connected to a host computer . The methods include steps which may be performed by the host computer steps which may be performed by a server which may be the web based application delivery interface and in some cases the application delivery server and steps which may be performed by the device . More particularly the web based application store application may contain instructions for causing a processor not shown associated with the host computer to perform the host computer specific steps. Similarly the application store client may contain instructions for causing a processor associated with the device to perform the device specific steps. Similarly the web based application delivery server interface and or the application delivery server may contain instructions for causing a processor associated with either of these servers to perform the server specific steps.

Referring first to a process for obtaining and running the web based application store application is illustrated. The process of includes steps which may be performed by the host computer and steps which may be performed by the web based application delivery interface . In this example embodiment the host computer specific steps may be provided for by the Internet browser . That is the Internet browser may contain instructions for causing a processor associated with the host computer to perform the host computer specific steps of the process . Similarly the web based application delivery server interface may contain instructions for causing a processor associated with the web based application delivery interface to perform the server specific steps.

First at step the Internet browser receives instructions to navigate to a web page. The instructions may be received for example by direct entry of a uniform resource locator URL associated with the web based application delivery interface into an address bar associated with the Internet browser. In other cases the instructions may be received by selection of a link to a URL associated with the web based application delivery interface . For example the URL may be selected from a bookmarked link.

In response to receiving the instruction to navigate to the web page the Internet browser at step navigates to the web page. That is the Internet browser may use the URL to establish a hypertext transfer protocol HTTP connection or hypertext transfer protocol secure HTTPS connection to the web based application delivery server interface .

In response to the establishment of this connection at step the web based application delivery server interface retrieves the web based application store application from a memory storage associated with the web based application delivery server interface . Next at step the web based application delivery server interface sends the web application to the host computer . The web based application delivery server interface is received at step and is run by the Internet browser at step .

After the application is run it will perform one or more functions either immediately upon running or in response to the occurrence of one or more trigger conditions. The trigger conditions may be for example a selection via an input mechanism associated with the host computer of a selectable option to initiate one of the functions.

The web based application store application may in various example embodiments be configured to provide for any one or more of the following features and functions i automatic delivery to the host computer or device of any required plug in device driver and or application store client ii an application store interface for allowing a user of the host computer to browse for purchase and download applications available for download to the device iii a remote storage interface for allowing a user of the host computer to browse for applications previously purchased or downloaded as the case may be to the mobile device or in some example embodiments to a mobile devices associated with a common user and to install such applications to the same device or in some example embodiments to another mobile device associated with the same user iv other application management functions such as the ability to delete applications from the device . Additional features and functions may also be provided. Each of these functions will now be described in greater detail.

Referring now to in at least some example embodiments the web based application store application is configured to automatically deliver a plug in device driver and or application store client .

More particularly the web based application store application may contain instructions for causing a processor not shown associated with the host computer to perform the host computer specific steps. Similarly the web based application delivery server interface and or the application delivery server may contain instructions for causing a processor associated with either of these servers to perform the server specific steps.

Since a compatible application store client is not necessarily installed on the device during the period of time that the process operates the device specific steps of the process may be performed by an application other than the application store client . The device specific steps of the process are typically performed by a command interpreter which is known to be included on the device or which is likely to be included on the device. For example in some example embodiments the device specific steps of the process are performed by a command interpreter that is included in the operating system .

In at least some example embodiments the process may be triggered when the web based application store application is run. That is the process may be configured to automatically determine whether components needed to communicate with the device such as the plug in device driver and or application store client are installed. In other example embodiments the process may be triggered when a user attempts to initiate a process which would require device communications. For example the process may be triggered when the user selects an option to download an application to the device .

When the process is triggered at step the web based application store application determines whether the plug in is installed on the host computer . Next at step if the host computer does not already contain the plug in the plug in is requested. In some example embodiments if the host computer does not include the plug in the web based application store application may automatically request the plug in from a remote server such as for example the application delivery server or the web based application delivery server interface .

In other example embodiments if the host computer does not include the plug in the web based application store application may display an error message within the Internet browser or within a pop up window to advise the user that the plug in is not yet installed on the host computer . The error message may be presented together with a user selectable option permitting the user of the host computer to download the plug in by interacting with an input mechanism associated with the host computer . If a user selects the option to download the plug in the request may be sent at step .

The request is received at the server which may be the web based application delivery server interface or the application delivery server at step . The server retrieves the plug in step and sends the plug in to the host computer step . The host computer receives the plug in and installs the plug in onto the host computer at step .

The installation of the plug in onto the host computer may in some example embodiments occur automatically. In other example embodiments it may be user initiated. Whether the download and installation occurs automatically or whether it requires further user input may depend at least in part on the configuration of security settings on the host computer .

In a similar manner in some example embodiments the web based application store application may be configured to determine whether the host computer contains the device driver which communicates with the device .

First at step the web based application store application determines whether the device driver is installed on the host computer . Next at step if the host computer does not already contain the device driver the device driver is requested. In some example embodiments if the host computer does not include the device driver the web based application store application may automatically request the device driver from a remote server such as for example the application delivery server or the web based application delivery server interface .

In other example embodiments if the host computer does not include the device driver the web based application store application may display an error message within the Internet browser or within a pop up window to advise the user that the device driver is not yet installed on the host computer . The error message may be presented together with a user selectable option permitting the user of the host computer to download the device driver by interacting with an input mechanism associated with the host computer . If a user selects the option to download the device driver the request may be sent at step .

The request is received at the server which may be the web based application delivery server interface or the application delivery server at step . The server or retrieves the device driver step and sends the device driver to the host computer step . The host computer receives the device driver and installs the device driver onto the host computer at step .

The installation of the device driver onto the host computer may in some example embodiments occur automatically. In other example embodiments it may be user initiated. Whether the download and installation occurs automatically or whether it requires further user input may depend at least in part on the configuration of security settings on the host computer .

In some example embodiments the web based application store application is also configured to determine whether the mobile device contains an application which is capable of receiving and executing commands sent from the web based application store application to the device . For example in some example embodiments it will determine whether the mobile device has a compatible application store client . In order to determine whether the mobile device contains a compatible application store client the application store application may send a request step to the device to provide information about any application store client installed on the device . The device receives the request and sends the requested application store client information to the host computer step where it is received at step .

The application store client information may in some example embodiments be provided in the form of a version number identifying a version of the application store client installed on the device. In some example embodiments if no application store client is installed on the device the device may return a message indicating that the application store client is not installed on the device.

Since a compatible application store client is not necessarily installed on the device at the time of the request the request step may be sent to an application other than the application store client . For example in some example embodiments the request is issued via a command which is known to have or which is likely to have a compatible interpreter. For example in some example embodiments the request may be issued to a command interpreter native to the operating system on the device .

After receiving the information about any application store client installed on the device the web based application store application may determine at step from the application store client information received at step whether there is a compatible application store client stored on the device. This may be determined for example by comparing the version number of the application store client to a list of compatible versions.

The determination at step may include any one or more of the following determination if the version of the application store client is compatible with the web based application store application determining if a version of the application store client is available which is newer than the application store client installed on the device and or determining if no application store client is installed on the device .

In response to the existence of any one or combination of the following trigger conditions the web based application store application may request the application store client step . These conditions are a determination that the version of the application store client is incompatible with the web based application store application ii a determination that the version of the application store client is available which is newer than the application store client installed on the device and or iii a determination that no application store client is installed on the device .

The request for the application store client is received at the server at step . In response the server retrieves the application store from a memory storage associated with the server at step and sends the application store client to the host computer at step . The web based application store application on the host computer receives the application store client from the server at step and sends the application store client to the device at step .

In some example embodiments once downloaded the application store client may be automatically installed to the device . That is after the host computer has downloaded the application store client it may send the application store client to the device together with a command to the device telling the device to install the application store client on the device . As explained previously since a compatible application store client is not necessarily installed on the device at the time of the command the command may be sent to an application other than the application store client . For example in some example embodiments the command is issued to an interpreter which is known to exist on the device or which is likely to exist . For example in some example embodiments the request may be issued to the operating system on the device.

After the application store client has been installed on the device the device may send a message to the host computer to advise the host computer that the application store client has been successfully installed to the device.

Upon receiving the message from the device advising that the application has been successfully installed on the device the web based application store application may unlock additional features which require device communications. Such additional features may includes for example features allowing applications to be installed to the device and or features allowing the applications to be deleted from the device .

In at least some example embodiments the web based application store application may be configured for allowing a user of the host computer to browse or search for applications available through the application delivery server and to at the request of the user download such application to the device through the link .

That is the web based application store application provides an interface which allows a user of the host computer to connect to the application delivery server and to browse or search for applications available for download to the mobile communication device . The application store client permits users of the host computer to purchase applications for use on the mobile device .

The web based application store application may provide one or more tools to permit a user of the host computer to locate applications of interest. For example the web based application store application may provide a search tool which allows a user of the host computer to input one or more search parameters into the Internet browser and to receive search results corresponding to the one or more search parameters. The search parameters may in various example embodiments allow a user to specify any one or more of the following a name of the application a release date or date range associated with the application a category related to the application a cost or cost range associated with the application one or more keywords describing the function of the application. Other parameters may also be used.

It will be appreciated that the search will typically be performed by a back end server such as for example the application delivery server . That is the web based application store application on the host computer transmits the search parameters to the server such as the application delivery server which in response returns the results of the search.

The web based application store application may also permit the user of the host computer to browse available applications by category type. For example the web based application store application may provide one or more user selectable options within the Internet browser which allow a user to browse applications in a specific category. The categories may describe the nature of the functions of the applications contained in those categories. The categories may include for example a game category a productivity category an instant messaging category a social networking category and or a navigation category. Other categories are also possible.

Referring now to in at least some example embodiments the web based application store application may be configured to provide filtered results when searching or browsing to filter out applications that are not compatible with the device .

More particularly the web based application store application may contain instructions for causing a processor not shown associated with the host computer to perform the host computer specific steps. Similarly the web based application delivery server interface and or the application delivery server may contain instructions for causing a processor associated with either of these servers to perform the server specific steps. The application store client may contain instructions for causing the processor associated with the device to perform the device specific steps.

In order to provide this functionality the web based application store application may send a request step to the device to receive device configuration information from the device . The device may be configured to receive the request step for device configuration information and to return step to the host computer the requested device configuration information. The device configuration information may relate to the capabilities of the device and or the applications contained thereon. The device configuration information may in various example embodiments include operating software version information identifying the version number of operating system software currently installed on the device. In some example embodiments the device configuration information may include a model number associated with the device. In some example embodiments the device configuration information may specify whether specific hardware is installed on the device. In some example embodiments the device configuration information may specify whether specific hardware is enabled on the device. Other device configuration information is also possible.

The web based application store application may receive the device configuration information and provide filtered results during searching and or browsing. That is the results which are provided may be filtered so that only applications which are compatible with the device are displayed.

In some example embodiments in order to provide filtered search results the device configuration information may be provided steps and to the remote server such as the application delivery server which is powering the searching and or browsing functions.

Search parameters or browsing parameters may be received from an input mechanism of the host computer at the web based application store application at step and sent to the server at step . The server may receive the search and or browsing parameters step and return filtered results to the web based application store application . The filtered search results are received and displayed in the Internet browser of the host device at step . The filtered results may be filtered so that applications which are not compatible with the device are not displayed.

In at least some example embodiments the web based application store application may be configured to provide filtered results when searching or browsing to filter out applications that are already installed on the device .

In order to provide this functionality the web based application store application may send a request to the device for installed application information identifying applications installed on the device i.e. the device information requested at step may among other things be a request for a list of installed applications . The device may be configured to receive the request for installed application information and to return to the host computer the requested installed application information. The installed application information may include identifiers of all applications that are currently installed on the device . The installed application information may include version numbers associated with the applications installed on the device .

In some example embodiments filtered results may automatically be provided during searching and or browsing. In other example embodiments the host computer may present the user with a user selectable option allowing the user to filter results in the manner specified above. For example in some example embodiments this option may be provided in a window which allows search parameters for a search to be input.

Referring now to a process for triggering a transmittal of an application to a device connected to a host computer is illustrated. The process includes steps which may be performed by the host computer steps which may be performed by a server which may be the application delivery server and steps which may be performed by the device .

More particularly the web based application store application may contain instructions for causing a processor not shown associated with the host computer to perform the host computer specific steps. Similarly the web based application delivery server interface and or the application delivery server may contain instructions for causing a processor associated with either of these servers to perform the server specific steps. The application store client may contain instructions for causing the processor associated with the device to perform the device specific steps.

The web based application store application may present a user with a user selectable option on the host computer to download an application to the device . A user may input instructions through the Internet browser to download the application to the device by using an input mechanism associated with the host computer such as for example a mouse or other navigational input mechanism. The instructions are received by the host computer at step .

In response to receiving instructions to download the application to the device the web based application store application may transmit a request for the application to the application delivery server step receive the application from the application delivery server at the host computer step and transmit the application from the host computer to the device step .

The request for the application may be transmitted at step together with an identifier of the specific application related to the request. For example the request may be transmitted with a unique identification number assigned to the specific application. The application delivery server receives the request step for the application and in response retrieves the application related to the request from storage and transmits the application related to the request to the host computer step .

In at least some example embodiments upon receiving the application step the host computer may automatically transmit the application to the device step . That is the application may be transmitted to the device without further input required from the user. The application is received at the device at step . In some example embodiments while the application is being downloaded a progress indicator which indicates the progress of the download may be displayed on the host computer .

In at least some example embodiments the host computer may also automatically transmit an installation command step to the device to automatically install the application to the device. The installation command is received by the application store client of the device step and as a result the application store client automatically installs the application to the device step .

In at least some example embodiments upon transmitting the application the host computer may automatically transmit the installation command to the device . That is the step in which the installation command is transmitted to the device may be performed without further input required from the user.

In at least some example embodiments the device may be configured to provide installation progress information to the host computer step to advise the host computer of the progress of the installation. The installation progress information may for example quantify or otherwise indicate the progress of the installation. To this end the installation progress information may include percentage complete information and or installation time remaining information.

The installation progress information may be received by the web based application store application at step and used to display at step in the Internet browser an installation progress indicator to visually indicate to the user of the host computer the progress of the installation on the device .

In at least some example embodiments not shown the web based application store application may be configured to determine whether a downloaded application requires the device to be reset in order to function properly. In order to make this determination the web based application store application may rely on application information received from a server such as the application delivery server . The application information may specify whether the application requires or recommends the device to be reset. If the application information indicates that a reset is required or in some example embodiments recommended the web based application store application may determine whether installation is completed in accordance with installation progress information received from the device . After installation is completed if the application requires a reset of the device the web based application store application may send a reset command to the device to reset the device . The reset command may be received by the application store client . When the reset command is received by the application store client the application store client may reset the device .

In at least some example embodiments not shown the application delivery server may provide at least some applications which require payment in order to download install or use the applications on a device . In such example embodiments the web based application store application may allow users of the host computer to purchase such applications. In some example embodiments in order to purchase an application a user of the host computer inputs login information to the web based application store application on the host computer using an input mechanism associated with the host computer. The login information may be associated with a user account. The host computer may transmit the login information to a server such as the application delivery server where the login information is authenticated. Payment may then be charged to an account associated with the user. Other methods of payment are also possible.

In some example embodiments not shown the web based application store application may be configured to receive memory usage information from the device . When a user generated request to download an application is received at the host computer the web based application store application may be configured to determine whether there is sufficient memory on the device for the installation. The web based application store application may make the determination by comparing the memory usage information which indicates available memory on the device and application size information regarding the application. The application size information may be obtained from the application delivery server . If the amount of space after the installation of the software would be less than a predetermined threshold i.e. if available memory application size information

It will be appreciated that in some example embodiments at least some of the features or functions described above by the web based application store may be provided by another component or module on the host computer . For example in some example embodiments the plug in may provide for at least some of the download functions described above. That is the web based application store may interact with the plug in to provide some of the functionality described herein. In one example embodiments the web based application store may receive the request to download the application step and may send a request to the application delivery server for a location of the file on the application delivery server . The application delivery server may return the location of the file for example in the form of a URL to the web based application store which may pass the location to the plug in. The plug in may then send the request to download the application at step and may receive the application at step . The plug in may at steps and download the application over HTTP from the specified URL and deliver it to the device at step .

Referring now to the web based application store application may in some example embodiments include a remote storage interface which is configured to permit applications which have been removed from the device or in some example embodiments from a device associated with the same user to be reinstalled to the device following their removal.

The web based application store application may provide an interface to view applications that a user or device already has access rights to for example by virtue of a previous download or purchase. Applications that a user has rights to may in some example embodiments be viewed through in a separate portion of the web based application store application . This portion of the web based application store application may only display applications which a user or device has rights to so that a user may separately view applications which they already have rights to. That is applications which a user or device has rights to may be displayed within the Internet browser in a display window which does not also list other applications which are available for purchase which a user does not already have rights to.

A user may access the remote storage interface of the web based application store application by selecting an option entitled Digital Storage Locker Remote Applications Previously Downloaded Applications or My World or an option with another similar descriptor.

In order to determine which applications a user or device has rights to i.e. which applications have been previously purchased or downloaded the web based application store application may at step provide login information to a rights management server not shown which tracks access rights to applications. The rights management server may in some example embodiments be implemented on the application delivery server . That is the application delivery server may be configured to track downloads and or purchases in order to track the devices and or users which have already obtained installation rights for the application.

In some example embodiments in order to enter the remote store interface portion of the web based application store application a user of the host computer inputs login information to the web based application store application on the host computer using an input mechanism associated with the host computer. The login information may be associated with a user account. The host computer may transmit the login information to a server at step such as the application delivery server where the login information is authenticated. The application delivery server or other rights management server receives the login information step and in response transmits a list of applications that a user or device as the case may be has rights to step . In at least some example embodiments the list is a list of applications previously downloaded to a device associated with the login information.

The web based application store application receives the list of applications that the user has rights to and displays the applications in the list in the Internet browser step . The web based application store application displays at least one user selectable option to download at least one of the applications to the device .

If a user selects a selectable option to download an application to the device the application is retrieved from the application delivery server and installed to the device in the manner described above with reference to .

In at least some example embodiments the web based application store application may provide for other device management functions. Such functions may include for example the ability to uninstall and delete applications installed on the device.

The web based application store application may request that the device provide information about the applications currently installed on the device step . The request is received at step and installed application information is sent at step . This information is received at the host computer at step .

Based on this information the web based application store application may display at step in the Internet browser a list of at least some of the applications currently installed on the device together with one or more user selectable option to delete applications installed on the device .

A user of the host computer may select the user selectable option via an input mechanism associated with the host computer . If a user selects an option to delete an application installed on the device step a delete command may be transmitted from the host computer to the device step . The delete command is received by the application store client step which as a result of receiving the command uninstalls and or deletes the application from the device step . In at least some example embodiments not shown the application store client sends a message back to the host computer after the deletion to confirm that the application has been deleted.

In at least one example embodiment the remote storage process described above with reference to and the application deletion process described above with reference to may be accessed via a common device sync screen. illustrates an example screen shot of a device sync screen which provides remote storage capabilities and application deletion capabilities. The device sync screen displays a list of applications that a user has rights to for example a list of applications previously downloaded to a device associated with login information transmitted from the host computer . The web based application store application determines based on information about the applications currently installed on the device received from the device which of the applications in the list are not currently installed on the device. Based on the result of the determination the web based device management application displays in the Internet browser a user selectable option to provide instructions to the web browser to download the applications to the device which are available for download and which are not currently installed on the device.

The web based device management application also displays in the Internet browser a user selectable option to delete the applications which are currently installed to the device. In response to receiving instructs to delete the application from the device the web based device management application sends a command from the host computer to the device to delete the application.

In the example embodiment shown the device sync display screen displays each application which the user has rights to together with a user selectable indicator indicating whether the application should be installed to the device. The selectable indicator is populated based on the list of currently installed application on the device . For example the selectable indicator may be pre selected for all applications currently installed on the device. The user may deselect any one of the selected indicators to delete the application from the device. Similarly a user may select any one of the unselected indicators to install the application to the device.
