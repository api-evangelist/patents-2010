title: Underwater acoustic waveguide
abstract: A system and method for generating an underwater acoustic waveguide suitable for guiding acoustic energy between a source and a receiver to enable underwater communications. Electrolysis of water by electrically powered terminals continuously creates a bubble field having a volume fraction of less than 0.01% gas. The bubble field has a lower sound speed than the surrounding water, resulting in the bubble field acting as a waveguide to transmit sound over the length of the bubble field. By maintaining small bubble radii, the bubble field can be stable for long periods of time. By keeping the volume fraction and bubble radii small, the power requirements for the terminals are minimized.

The present invention relates to underwater communication and more particularly to a system and method for generating an underwater acoustic waveguide to guide acoustic energy between a source and a receiver.

It is known in the art that the attenuation of acoustic energy in water presents problems in long distance underwater communications. While very low frequency acoustic energy can be propagated over long distances the underwater environment is noisy in these bands.

At higher frequencies the attenuation is such that high power is needed to generate sufficiently strong acoustic energy needed for communication. For example spherical spreading losses lead to approximately 66 decibel dB attenuation at a range of approximately 2000 meters.

It is also known in the art that acoustic energy confined to a waveguide can travel over large distances without spherical spreading losses.

What are therefore needed are a system and method for generating an underwater waveguide such that acoustic energy can be transmitted through the waveguide over long distances. Accordingly the waveguide needs to be stable over time and needs to extend over long distances to provide underwater communication between widely separated platforms. For efficiency the power requirements for generating the waveguide need to be minimized.

It is therefore a general purpose and primary object of the present invention to provide systems and methods for generating an underwater acoustic waveguide suitable for guiding acoustic energy between a source and a receiver while suppressing acoustic energy propagation in directions other than that of the waveguide so as to enable secure underwater communications.

In the invention electrically powered terminals continuously create a bubble field by electrolysis. The speed of sound is reduced within the bubble field. As an example a volume fraction of 0.03 gas reduces the sound speed of the mixture by a factor of two. It is known that sound bends continuously towards a region of slower speed. Since the bubble field has a lower sound speed than the surrounding water refraction tends to keep the sound within the field. Thus as the bubble field transits through the water the bubble field acts as a waveguide to transmit sound over the length of the bubble field.

By keeping the volume fraction small the power requirements for the terminals are minimized. In addition generating bubbles via electrolysis permits good control over the bubble radii. By maintaining small bubble radii the bubble field can be stable for long periods of time.

For example a bubble in water having a radius of 0.1 millimeter mm will rise at a terminal velocity of 20 mm second mm s while a bubble radius of 0.03 mm leads to a terminal velocity of 2 mm s. At a velocity of 2 mm s the bubble field rises only 7 meters m per hour.

In one embodiment a system for underwater communication includes an underwater communication platform a second communication platform and a bubble field extending between the platforms. In one embodiment the bubble field has a volume fraction of less than 0.03 gas. In another embodiment the bubble field has a volume fraction of less than 0.01 gas. In yet another embodiment the system includes an acoustic transceiver at each of the platforms. The transceivers transmit and receive acoustic signals within the bubble field.

In one embodiment the system includes a bubble field generator aboard the underwater vehicle. The bubble generator can include a power source and two terminals connected respectively to a positive and a negative portion of the power source. The terminals are immersed in water and electrolysis of the water forms bubbles at the terminals.

Radii of the bubbles can be controlled to limit a terminal velocity of the bubbles rising in water. A length of the bubble field is dependent on the depth at which the bubble field is generated the terminal velocity of the bubbles and the speed at which the underwater platform transits through the water. The spacing between the terminals corresponds to a quarter wavelength of the acoustic signals transmitted within the bubble field.

In one embodiment an underwater communication system includes an underwater communication platform a second communication platform an electrolyzer aboard the underwater platform and a bubble field generated by the electrolyzer and extending between the underwater communication platform and the second communication platform. The system can allow movement of the second communication platform to maintain the bubble field connection between the communication platforms.

In one embodiment the bubbles forming the bubble field have an average radius of less than 0.1 millimeters. In another embodiment the bubbles have an average radius of less than 0.05 millimeters.

Referring to there is shown a schematic of an underwater vehicle UV in communication with a platform . For illustration but not limitation the platform is shown at a water surface . A generator aboard the UV generates a bubble field as the UV transits through water in the direction of arrow .

For communication between the UV and the platform the bubble field extends between the UV and the platform. As the UV generates the bubble field the bubble field rises towards the surface . Accordingly a trailing end of the bubble field furthest from the UV is closer to the surface than a forward end nearest to the UV.

Referring to there is shown the bubble field being generated via electrolysis of the water . An electrolyzer includes two terminals and . The terminals and are immersed in the water and connected to a power source such that the terminal is positive and the terminal is negative. The power source generates a current illustrated by a dotted arrow that passes between the terminals and . As is known in the art the current causes the water to split into constituent hydrogen and oxygen gasses designated as bubbles that as a group form the bubble field . For clarity of illustration only three of the bubbles have been so designated.

As previously discussed a bubble field with a bubble fraction of 0.03 gas has a lower sound speed than the surrounding water. To ensure a suitable waveguide the volume fraction for the bubble field can be less than 0.01 gas. Accordingly refraction will tend to keep sound within the bubble field . Hence the bubble field acts as a waveguide and spherical spreading losses are minimized. The bubble field as a waveguide confines most of the acoustic energy thereby enabling secure underwater communications with low power sources.

Typical acoustic waveguides have transverse dimensions on the order of a quarter wavelength. Accordingly spacing between the terminals and can be such that the transverse dimension t in of the bubble field corresponds to a quarter wavelength of the acoustic energy to be transmitted therethrough.

The length of the bubble field is limited by the depth at which the bubble field is generated by the terminal velocity of the individual bubbles that make up the bubble field and by the speed at which the UV moves through the water . Stokes Law governs the bubble terminal velocity 

The bubble field can be stable for long periods of time on the order of hours when the terminal velocity V is low. As an example a bubble having a radius of 0.1 mm will rise in the water at a terminal velocity of 20 mm s and a bubble with a radius of 0.03 mm has a terminal velocity of 2 mm s rising only 7 m per hour. Considering as an example a depth of 10 m for the UV it will take on the order of one and one half hours for a bubble of radius 0.03 mm to rise from the UV to the surface . For an exemplary speed of 5 kilometers km per hour for the UV the bubble field will have a length of over 7 km.

Thus an underwater vehicle with a power source and an electrical grid such as the UV with power source and terminals and can continuously create a bubble field waveguide such as the bubble field by electrolysis as the underwater vehicle transits through the water. By the underwater vehicle initiating the waveguide such that the waveguide intersects with a communications platform such as the platform the waveguide can enable a communications path between the platform and the underwater vehicle.

As the waveguide minimizes spherical spreading losses low power acoustic transceivers at the platform and the underwater vehicle such as transceivers and in can maintain long range communications through the waveguide. The low bubble volume fraction less than about 0.01 minimizes the power needed to generate the bubbles via electrolysis. The small radii of the bubbles required for a lengthy and stable waveguide e.g. radii of about 0.03 mm for a 7 km waveguide also minimize the power requirements for electrolysis. Additionally the radii of the bubbles can be optimized to obtain the desired length and duration for the bubble field based on Equation 1 .

What have thus been described are systems and methods for long range secure underwater communications. A bubble field is generated by an underwater vehicle via electrolysis. The bubble field extends between the underwater vehicle and a communications platform. The bubble field has a volume fraction of less than 0.01 gas such that acoustic energy is refracted within the bubble field.

As a result of the refraction within the bubble field acoustic energy losses from the bubble field are minimized. Thus the bubble field serves as a secure waveguide for the transmission of acoustic signals. In addition the radii of the bubbles making up the bubble field are controlled such that the terminal velocity of the bubbles rising within the water is optimized for the desired length and duration of the waveguide.

Obviously many modifications and variations of the present invention may become apparent in light of the above teachings. For example to maintain communication over longer periods the platform can move about the surface to remain in connection with the bubble field . Additionally the platform need not be a surface platform. The platform may be another underwater vehicle that intercepts the bubble field to initiate communication with the UV .

While electrolysis provides a preferred means for generating the bubble field due to both the low power requirements and the control over bubble radii other means can also be employed. As examples but not for limitation chemical interactions e.g. sodium bicarbonate and water or discharging compressed gas through a perforated plate can also generate suitable bubble fields.

In light of the above it is therefore understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.
