The present invention relates to an elastic wave device using a trapping energy effect and particularly relates to a technique to miniaturize the elastic wave device.

When controlling frequency or selecting frequency in a small sized high frequency communication device such as a portable terminal there is a is small sized high frequency communication device employing an oscillator or a filter using a trapping energy type resonator hereinafter the oscillator and the filter are generically called an elastic wave device .

A trapping energy type elastic wave device obtains a necessary frequency response by using resonance to occur by trapping energy of thickness vibration in a piezoelectric body of quartz crystal or the like. The thickness vibration to be used in the elastic wave device of this type vibrates at a frequency on a high frequency side in the vicinity of a cutoff frequency of the piezoelectric body. Thus electrodes for excitation are provided at center portions on an upper surface and a lower surface of for example a plate shaped piezoelectric body and a resonant frequency of thickness vibration in a region having the electrodes provided thereon is reduced by a mass loading effect of the electrodes to be lower than a cutoff frequency of the thickness vibration in a peripheral portion to thereby achieve trapping of the energy of the thickness vibration in the region having the electrodes provided thereon.

Here a cutoff frequency of a piezoelectric body is in inverse proportion to a thickness of the piezoelectric body so that it is necessary to thin the piezoelectric body in order to increase a resonant frequency of vibration to be obtained by trapping energy which is called a trapping energy mode and in combination with miniaturization and sophistication in performance of a portable terminal and the like the elastic wave device is rapidly miniaturized.

However when the piezoelectric body is thinned in order to increase the resonant frequency it is also necessary to thin the electrodes to be suitable for trapping energy. When the electrodes are thinned there is a fear that an insertion loss of the whole elastic wave device is increased due to an insufficiency of electric conductivity.

Normally however there is a high fear that masses of the electrodes constituted by metal and the like change with time due to oxidation corrosion or the like and the elastic wave device to have the electrodes directly provided on the region where trapping energy is performed which will be called a trapping energy portion hereinafter has a problem that the resonant frequency changes by an influence of a mass change in the electrodes.

Thus in order to suppress the above influence of the change with time in the electrode masses various types of elastic wave devices to have no electrode provided on a region where resonance is generated are proposed. In Patent Document 1 for example there is disclosed a resonator in which electrodes for excitation are provided at both right and left ends of a plate shaped piezoelectric body and a center region sandwiched between regions of both the right and left ends is not provided with an electrode to be set as a region to determine a resonant frequency and groove shaped cuts are provided between the region of the right end and the center region and between the region of the left end and the center region thereby separating the respective regions elastically and moderately. Further in Patent Document 2 and Non Patent Document 1 there is disclosed a piezoelectric vibrator in which electrodes for excitation are provided on regions of both right and left ends of a plate shaped piezoelectric substrate and an electrode is not provided on a center region sandwiched between these regions and by making a thickness of the region having no electrode provided thereon thicker than those of the regions of both the ends resonant frequencies of these regions are made approximately the same thereby enabling the respective regions to be coupled to one another acoustically.

Besides the above in Non Patent Document 2 and Non Patent Document 3 there is disclosed a resonator of a type in which a region without an electrode which is formed thicker than a periphery and called a mesa is provided at a center portion of a plate shaped piezoelectric body and electrodes for excitation are formed in a groove formed in a periphery of this mesa to obtain resonance by using the electrodes and a trapping energy effect to occur in the mesa surrounded by the electrodes.

These resonators the piezoelectric vibrator disclosed in Patent Document 1 Patent Document 2 and Non Patent Document 1 to Non Patent Document 3 by providing the region of a center side without an electrode being provided independently of the regions for excitation provided with the electrodes manage to have little effect of the change with time to occur in the electrodes on the region of the center side and thus increase long term frequency stability as a whole of the resonator or the piezoelectric vibrator the elastic wave device .

Incidentally in Patent Document 3 there is disclosed a technique in which thicknesses of regions of both ends with electrodes provided thereon of a vibration wave propagating medium to be a vibrator are thinned and on the other hand a thickness of a center region sandwiched between these regions and having no electrode provided thereon is thickened and further a length of the above center region is adjusted to satisfy a predetermined condition thereby taking out only a desired harmonic vibration from among a plurality of harmonics excited in the electrode on one side. As described above in the vibrator disclosed in Patent Document 3 an object of providing the center region without an electrode is different from that of stability of a resonant frequency.

Each elastic wave device disclosed in above described Patent Document 1 Patent Document 2 Non Patent Document 1 to Non Patent Document 3 is structured in a manner that an electrode is not provided on a center region to obtain resonance in order to suppress an influence on a resonant frequency based on a change with time in mass of an electrode. However these elastic wave devices are constituted as what is called a composite resonator composite vibrator type elastic wave device to generate resonance by using vibration in the same mode as a vibration mode generated in regions having electrodes provided thereon so that it is not possible to completely eliminate the influence that a frequency change in the vibration mode due to a mass change in the electrodes has on the resonant frequency to be obtained in the region having no electrode provided thereon.

Particularly when a piezoelectric body of the elastic wave device is thinned in order to obtain high frequency resonance a change rate of a mass loading effect increases even though a slight mass change of the piezoelectric body occurs. Thus the frequency change in the vibration mode to be excited in the regions having the electrodes provided thereon also increases resulting that the resonant frequency also changes significantly. Accordingly it is not possible to stabilize the resonant frequency sufficiently in conventional methods disclosed in above described respective Patent Documents and Non Patent Documents and the change with time in the electrode mass is still a significant obstacle to a further increase in frequency and miniaturization of the elastic wave device.

The present invention has been made under such circumstances and an object thereof is to provide an elastic wave device that is small sized and in which a frequency fluctuation due to aging hardly occurs and an electronic component using the above elastic wave device.

The above described elastic wave devices according to the first and second inventions may also include the following characteristics.

 c The first IDT electrode and the second IDT electrode are provided on a front surface of the piezoelectric material and the first elastic wave and the third elastic wave are surface acoustic waves.

 d The cutoff portion is formed to have a cutoff frequency being a frequency higher than that of the second elastic wave because a thickness of the elastic wave waveguide constituting the cutoff portion is thinner than that of the elastic wave waveguide constituting the trapping energy mode portion. e The elastic wave waveguide is formed in a manner that a thickness of an outer region of the cutoff portion is thicker than that of the cutoff portion. f The elastic wave waveguide is made of a piezoelectric material. g The piezoelectric material is a piezoelectric film provided on an upper surface side of an IDT electrode formed on an elastic wave waveguide made of a non piezoelectric material or is a piezoelectric film provided between an elastic wave waveguide made of a non piezoelectric material and an IDT electrode. h The trapping energy mode portion is formed in a flat plate shape. i The trapping energy mode portion is formed in a plano convex lens shape. j The trapping energy mode portion is formed in a manner that a planar shape thereof is a polygon with four or more angles or a circle or an ellipse. k At least one of the first IDT electrode and the second IDT electrode is made of a uni directional transducer electrode. l The elastic wave device includes two or more trapping energy mode portions whose peripheries are each surrounded by the cutoff portion and in which the trapping energy mode portions are provided adjacently to each other or one another in the propagation direction of the elastic wave in the propagation mode or in a direction perpendicular to the propagation direction to enable second elastic waves to be excited in the respective trapping energy mode portions to be coupled to each other or one another and thereby a multi mode coupled filter is constituted. m The second elastic wave is an elastic wave in a high order trapping energy mode. n An adsorption layer to adsorb a substance to be sensed is formed on a front surface of the trapping energy mode portion.

According to the present invention a first elastic wave being an elastic wave in a propagation mode such as for example a surface acoustic wave is propagated in an elastic wave waveguide and in a trapping energy mode portion provided in the elastic wave waveguide and whose periphery is surrounded by a cutoff portion a second elastic wave in a trapping energy mode is excited by a specific frequency component included in the first elastic wave and thereby a resonance response can be obtained without providing an electrode on the trapping energy mode portion. Accordingly a change in a frequency characteristic due to a mass change in an electrode does not occur in the trapping energy mode portion so that it is possible to obtain an elastic wave device in which further miniaturization thereof is easy to be performed and a frequency fluctuation due to aging hardly occurs.

Hereinafter a constitution of an elastic wave resonator being one example of an elastic wave device according to an embodiment will be explained with reference to to . As illustrated in a perspective view in the elastic wave resonator is constituted in a manner that first and second IDT electrodes are provided on both right and left sides in a longitudinal direction across a center portion of a piezoelectric body processed into a small piece shape and regions having these IDT electrodes provided thereon and a region sandwiched between both the IDT electrodes and are set as an elastic wave waveguide and at for example a center portion in the elastic wave waveguide a trapping energy mode portion for exciting an elastic wave in a trapping energy mode is provided.

The piezoelectric body is an AT cut quartz crystal piece for example and is processed in a manner that a length in an A A direction that corresponds to a direction in which elastic waves in propagation modes propagate and will be called the longitudinal direction hereinafter illustrated in is for example about several hundred m to several mm a length in a direction perpendicular to the A A direction which will be called a width direction hereinafter is for example about to half of the length in the longitudinal direction and a thickness that is described as h in is for example several ten m to several hundred m.

The elastic wave waveguide described already is provided on one surface that will be called a front surface hereinafter of the piezoelectric body and the first IDT electrode provided on for example the left region on the elastic wave waveguide is provided with a function to electro mechanically convert an electrical signal input to the first IDT electrode to excite for example a surface acoustic wave that will be called a SAW hereinafter being an elastic wave. On the other hand the second IDT electrode provided on for example the right region on the elastic wave waveguide serves to mechano electrically convert the SAW propagated through the elastic wave waveguide to take it out as an electrical signal.

The IDT electrodes are each provided with constitutions substantially similar to each other and thus the constitution of for example the first IDT electrode is explained simply. The first IDT electrode is a well known IDT Inter Digital Transducer electrode made of a metal film such as for example aluminum or gold and is constituted in a manner that a large number of electrode fingers are connected to a bus bar and a large number of electrode fingers are connected to a bus bar in an interdigitated manner and the two bus bars are disposed along a propagation direction of a SAW in the elastic wave waveguide for example. Each of the IDT electrodes illustrated in this embodiment is provided with for example the several ten to several hundred electrode fingers but in each of the drawings the number of the electrode fingers are omitted to be illustrated.

An interval d between the adjacent electrode fingers and in the first IDT electrode is adjusted to a length of for example a half wavelength of a SAW to be trapped in the trapping energy mode portion that will be described later for example. An input terminal of an electrical signal is connected to for example the bus bar on one side in the first IDT electrode and further the bus bar on the other side is grounded.

The second IDT electrode is constituted substantially similarly to the above described first IDT electrode and an output terminal of an electrical signal is connected to a bus bar on one side and a bus bar on the other side is grounded. A distance between the first IDT electrode and the second IDT electrode is set appropriately but the distance is required to be a distance such that a later described cutoff portion and the trapping energy mode portion are allowed to be disposed between these two IDT electrodes and . Further the second IDT electrode is preferable to be disposed at a position where a later described third elastic wave being the elastic wave in the propagation mode which is leaked from the above described cutoff portion is added to for example the electrode fingers in the second IDT electrode on an output side in an inphase or opposite phase manner.

When an electrical signal is input to the first IDT electrode a SAW is excited in the first IDT electrode and the SAW propagates toward the second IDT electrode on the output side in the vicinity of the front surface of the piezoelectric body as the elastic wave in the propagation mode. The elastic wave resonator according to this embodiment is structured to obtain resonance by using the above SAW. Hereinafter a detailed constitution for obtaining resonance by using a SAW will be explained.

The trapping energy mode portion and the cutoff portion serve to mode convert part of a SAW propagated in the piezoelectric body and to excite an elastic wave in a trapping energy mode. The trapping energy mode portion is a region where the elastic wave in the trapping energy mode is excited and the cutoff portion is a region to trap the above elastic wave in the trapping energy mode portion .

The trapping energy mode portion is one region in the piezoelectric body processed to have a thickness h capable of exciting the elastic wave in the trapping energy mode at a previously designed resonant frequency and is provided at substantially the center position between the first IDT electrode on an input side and the second IDT electrode on the output side in an example. The trapping energy mode portion is formed in a manner that a planar shape seen from for example an upper side is a quadrangle and one side thereof is for example about several hundred m in length. The trapping energy mode portion is disposed in a manner that for example two sides of the quadrangle that face to each other are parallel to a traveling direction of the SAW in other words the SAW is input perpendicularly to the remaining two sides of the quadrangle .

The trapping energy mode portion according to this example as illustrated in and is provided in a recessed portion formed at the center portion on a surface that is called a rear surface opposite to a side of the front surface of the piezoelectric body where the already described IDT electrodes are formed and is formed to project in a terrace shape mesa shape from a bottom surface of the recessed portion . A rectangular parallelepiped portion ranging from an upper surface of the region projecting in a terrace shape to the front surface of the piezoelectric body corresponds to the trapping energy mode portion .

The cutoff portion is one region in the piezoelectric body which is formed to surround the above described trapping energy mode portion and forms the recessed portion integrally with the trapping energy mode portion . The cutoff portion corresponds to an angular ring shaped portion ranging from the bottom surface of the recessed portion formed one step lower than the trapping energy mode portion to the front surface of the piezoelectric body .

Since the trapping energy mode portion and the cutoff portion are provided at substantially the center position of the piezoelectric body as illustrated in in this example when seen from the trapping energy mode portion and the cutoff portion a region on an upstream side in the propagation direction of the SAW corresponds to a first propagation mode portion and similarly a region on a downstream side thereof corresponds to a second propagation mode portion .

Here as explained in DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART a conventional trapping energy type resonator achieves trapping energy in regions having electrodes provided thereon by using a mass loading effect of the electrodes. In contrast in the trapping energy mode portion and the cutoff portion according to this embodiment the respective regions are formed in a manner that the thickness h of the trapping energy mode portion is thicker than a thickness h of the cutoff portion as illustrated in for example and thereby the elastic wave resonator has a significant characteristic with regard to a point on which trapping energy in the trapping energy mode portion is achieved by making a resonant frequency of thickness vibration in the trapping energy mode portion lower than a cutoff frequency in the cutoff portion .

Sizes of the trapping energy mode portion and the cutoff portion are illustrated in an exaggerated manner in each of the drawings such as and in order to make a state where the trapping energy mode portion projects in a terrace shape from the bottom surface of the recessed portion understandable but the elastic wave resonator whose resonant frequency is for example approximately 100 MHz is constituted as an extremely small sized device such that the thicknesses h h of the regions of the trapping energy mode portion and the cutoff portion in the piezoelectric body are about ten odd m and further a difference between the thicknesses of the trapping energy mode portion and the cutoff portion namely a height of the portion projecting in a terrace shape is for example about ten odd nm. Further at a resonant frequency that is a higher frequency such as a gigahertz the thicknesses h h of the trapping energy mode portion and the cutoff portion and the height of the terrace are further reduced.

There will be explained one example of a designing method to determine the sizes of the trapping energy mode portion and the cutoff portion . When standing waves of a thickness vibration wave whose wavelength is n 2 n is an integer are generated in the trapping energy mode portion and the cutoff portion having the thicknesses h h respectively as illustrated in it is possible to express a relationship between a cutoff angular frequency in the trapping energy mode portion and the thickness h by the following expression 1 and to express a relationship between an angular frequency of the standing wave to be formed in the trapping energy mode portion and a wave number thereof by the following expression 2 .

Further it is possible to express a relationship between a cutoff angular frequency in the cutoff portion and the thickness h by the following expression 3 and to express a relationship between an angular frequency of the standing wave to be formed in the cutoff portion and a wave number thereof by the following expression 4 .

At this time as schematically illustrated in when a thickness vibration wave in an Smode a symmetric mode being the trapping energy mode is excited in the trapping energy mode portion a resonant angular frequency thereof falls within a range of 

As described above in the expressions 1 to 4 the angular frequency of the standing wave satisfying a condition of the expression 5 corresponds to the resonant angular frequency .

A piezoelectric material to constitute the piezoelectric body is selected according to the relationships explained above and the resonant angular frequency of the elastic wave resonator is set to thereby obtain the thickness h and the length L of the trapping energy mode portion and the thickness h of the cutoff portion that enable the above resonant angular frequency to be obtained by for example trial and error by the expressions 1 to 5 and thereby the sizes of the trapping energy mode portion and the cutoff portion can be determined. Note that in the above described designing method one example of a way to obtain the sizes of the trapping energy mode portion and the cutoff portion is schematically described and the elastic wave resonator according to this embodiment is not limited to the trapping energy mode portion and the cutoff portion designed by the above designing method. It is a matter of course that by using for example a simulator or the like a condition capable of obtaining resonance in the trapping energy mode at the designed resonant angular frequency is searched and thereby the sizes of the trapping energy mode portion and the cutoff portion may be determined. Further if a structure simulator capable of calculating a frequency characteristic in an arbitrary shape such as a finite element method is used at this time it is possible to design the trapping energy mode portion and the cutoff portion simply.

The operation of the elastic wave resonator provided with the constitution explained above is explained. When an electrical signal is input to the first IDT electrode on the input side at present the electrical signal is electro mechanically converted in the IDT electrode and a SAW is excited and propagates in the vicinity of the front surface of the piezoelectric body in the elastic wave waveguide of the first propagation mode portion as illustrated in . The SAW being an elastic wave in a propagation mode which is excited in the first IDT electrode and propagates through the elastic wave waveguide is called a first elastic wave and the first elastic wave later reaches the region where the recessed portion is formed on the rear surface side.

As is the recessed portion in the elastic wave resonator according to this embodiment in the region where for example side peripheral walls of the recessed portion are formed substantially vertically and a shape of the piezoelectric body changes discontinuously most of the SAW propagated through the elastic wave waveguide is reflected in the above discontinuous region. However the SAW is an elastic wave propagating while focusing energy in the vicinity of the front surface of the piezoelectric body and thus there is sometimes a case that part of the SAW without being reflected in the discontinuous region further propagates through the flat region on the front surface side of the piezoelectric body and then is able to reach the region where the recessed portion is formed on the rear surface side.

The SAW that reaches the recessed portion passes through the cutoff portion to reach the trapping energy mode portion . At this time when a frequency component capable of exciting an elastic wave in an trapping energy mode in the trapping energy mode portion is included in the SAW being the first elastic wave that reaches the trapping energy mode portion part of the first elastic wave is mode converted to an elastic wave in a trapping energy mode that will be called a second elastic wave hereinafter in the trapping energy mode portion and resonance illustrated schematically in and is generated.

With respect to the second elastic wave excited in the trapping energy mode portion the cutoff portion formed in the periphery of the trapping energy mode portion has a cutoff frequency being a frequency higher than that of the second elastic wave so that energy that the second elastic wave has is brought into a state where it is trapped in the trapping energy mode portion . However the vibration energy of the second elastic wave is not brought into an off state of its on off in the cutoff portion in a rectangular function manner but it is attenuated exponentially as illustrated in .

Therefore the vibration energy of the part of the second elastic wave leaks into an outside region through the cutoff portion and is converted to a new elastic wave in a propagation mode. Then the above new elastic wave converted to a propagation mode for example the SAW which is called a third elastic wave propagates through the elastic wave waveguide on a side of the second propagation mode portion to reach the second IDT electrode on the output side. As a result in the second IDT electrode an electrical signal is taken out by mechano electrical conversion.

By the resonance of the second elastic wave to be excited in the trapping energy mode portion the elastic wave resonator according to this embodiment exhibits a frequency characteristic in which an admittance is made maximum at a resonant frequency f as illustrated in and can perform frequency control and frequency selection by using the above frequency characteristic.

Next there will be explained one example of a method of manufacturing the elastic wave resonator according to this embodiment with reference to to . First a resist is coated on a surface to be the rear surface of the piezoelectric body and the resist is patterned according to the planar shape of the recessed portion . Then the piezoelectric body by using anisotropic etching such as dry etching for example is shaved to for example the position of the height corresponding to an upper surface of the trapping energy mode portion to form the recessed portion .

Next the resist is coated on the surface of the piezoelectric body where the recessed portion is formed and the peripheral region of the trapping energy mode portion to project in a terrace shape is patterned in an angular ring shape to expose a region where the cutoff portion is formed . Then the exposed region is again shaved by dry etching or the like to form the trapping energy mode portion and the cutoff portion . Next on the front surface side of the piezoelectric body where the recessed portion is not formed the first and second IDT electrodes are patterned by using for example photolithography and the elastic wave resonator provided with the already described constitution is obtained.

The elastic wave resonator according to this embodiment has the following effect. The SAW being the first elastic wave in the propagation mode is propagated through the elastic wave waveguide and the second elastic wave in the trapping energy mode is excited by a specific frequency component included in the first elastic wave in the trapping energy mode portion provided in the elastic wave waveguide and whose periphery is surrounded by the cutoff portion and thereby a resonance response can be obtained without providing an electrode on the trapping energy mode portion . Therefore a change in a frequency characteristic due to a mass change in an electrode does not occur in the trapping energy mode portion so that an elastic wave device in which further miniaturization thereof is easy to be performed and a frequency fluctuation due to aging hardly occurs can be obtained.

Here in the elastic wave resonator the IDT electrode is provided on the input side of a frequency signal and the IDT electrode is provided on the output side of a frequency signal respectively. However even when these IDT electrodes oxidize or corrode to cause a change in their masses the first elastic wave SAW in this example to be excited in the piezoelectric body is little affected by the change. Then the trapping energy mode portion and the cutoff portion where resonance occurs are provided completely independently of the IDT electrodes and are not affected by the change in their masses so that a resonant frequency does not change with time and a stable frequency characteristic is exhibited.

Here as the operation of the above described elastic wave resonator has been explained by using as for the SAW being the first elastic wave that reaches the region where the recessed portion is formed on the rear surface side part of the SAW is converted to the second elastic wave in the trapping energy mode in the trapping energy mode portion but as for the SAW that is not converted to the second elastic wave part of the SAW further passes through the region where the recessed portion is formed and propagates through the second propagation mode portion to reach the second IDT electrode . If the SAW being the first elastic wave passes through the elastic wave waveguide as it is to be taken out as an electrical signal in the second IDT electrode in this manner there is sometimes a case that the first elastic wave becomes an unnecessary signal namely noise in detecting the third elastic wave leaked from the trapping energy mode portion .

Thus in order to suppress an influence of noise of the first elastic wave passing through the recessed portion an elastic wave resonator illustrated in is structured in a manner that an elastic wave waveguide for reference is provided adjacently to an elastic wave waveguide provided with a trapping energy mode portion and by differentiating both the elastic wave waveguides the noise is cancelled.

As for the elastic wave resonator illustrated in in a region R illustrated on a near side of an isolation zone made of for example a metal film or the like the elastic wave waveguide provided with first and second IDT electrodes and the trapping energy mode portion and a cutoff portion that are provided between the first IDT electrode and the second IDT electrode is formed similarly to the already described elastic wave resonator illustrated in to . On the other hand in a region R on a far side across the isolation zone the elastic wave waveguide for reference for reducing an influence of the above described noise is formed.

The elastic wave waveguide for reference formed in the region R is provided with a third IDT electrode and a fourth IDT electrode that are constituted substantially similarly to for example the first and second IDT electrodes at both ends of the elastic wave waveguide for reference and the third and fourth IDT electrodes are disposed in a manner that for example an interval between the third IDT electrode and the fourth IDT electrode is made the same as that between the first IDT electrode and the second IDT electrode on a region R side. Further on a rear surface side of the elastic wave waveguide for reference a second recessed portion is provided and the second recessed portion similarly to a recessed portion that is called a first recessed portion in an example the elastic wave resonator for distinction on the region R side is disposed at a substantially center position of the third IDT electrode and the fourth IDT electrode . Further a shape planar shape or depth of the second recessed portion is also constituted substantially similarly to that of the first recessed portion on the region R side but a point on which a trapping energy mode portion is not provided in the second recessed portion differs.

Thus when the first and third IDT electrodes are connected to a common input terminal and a frequency signal is input in the respective regions R R for example SAWs having substantially the same phases and amplitudes are excited in and propagate through the respective elastic wave waveguides because these IDT electrodes are constituted substantially similarly to each other and further are provided on a common piezoelectric body .

The SAW propagating through the elastic wave waveguide in the region R exhibits a behavior similar to that of the elastic wave resonator described already but on the other hand the SAW propagating through the elastic wave waveguide in the region R when reaching the second recessed portion exhibits a behavior similar to that in which the SAW propagating through the elastic wave waveguide in the region R is reflected in the first recessed portion and reaches the fourth IDT electrode without being affected by resonance in a trapping energy mode portion because only the second recessed portion is disposed and a trapping energy mode portion is not provided in the elastic wave waveguide in the region R. Then in this example the third IDT electrode and the fourth IDT electrode are disposed in a manner that the interval between the third IDT electrode and the fourth IDT electrode agrees with the interval between the first IDT electrode and the second IDT electrode on the region R side but a bus bar to be grounded in the fourth IDT electrode is set opposite that on a side of the second IDT electrode and thereby an electrical signal made after the SAW is converted in the fourth IDT electrode has an opposite phase to an electrical signal made after on the region R side the SAW passes through the trapping energy mode portion and the cut off portion to be converted in the second IDT electrode .

Thus by the sum of the electrical signal taken out of the second IDT electrode on the region R side and the electrical signal in opposite phase to the above electrical signal on the region R side taken out of the fourth IDT electrode on a region R side for reference namely by differentiating both the elastic wave waveguides it is possible to cancel the noise based on the first elastic wave reaching the second IDT electrode on the region R side. At this time the isolation zone serves to prevent the respective elastic waves of the two elastic wave waveguides from being coupled.

Here the interval between the IDT electrodes and an interval between electrode fingers a connection method of an input terminal and an output terminal and the like on a side of the elastic wave waveguide for reference are not limited to those in the above described example as long as an example has a constitution capable of canceling the noise by differentiating the two elastic wave waveguides the example can be modified appropriately. Further a constitution that the second recessed portion described already is not provided on the rear surface side of the elastic wave waveguide for reference may also be applied.

Next an elastic wave resonator illustrated in will be explained. The point on which the elastic wave resonator illustrated in is structured in a manner that independently of a first elastic wave to be excited in a first IDT electrode an elastic wave in a propagation mode reflected in a cutoff portion is taken out as a third elastic wave is different from the elastic wave resonator illustrated in in which the elastic wave in the propagation mode leaked from the trapping energy mode portion is set as the third elastic wave. The elastic wave resonator is constituted in a manner that the first IDT electrode to excite the first elastic wave and a second IDT electrode to take an electrical signal out of the third elastic wave are disposed to be for example parallel to each other and an isolation zone made of for example a metal film is disposed between the IDT electrode and the IDT electrode .

Then in a region on a near side from the isolation zone region R first elastic wave waveguide where the first IDT electrode on an excitation side is provided on a rear surface side of a piezoelectric body in the front of a propagation direction of a SAW the first elastic wave from the first IDT electrode a recessed portion provided with a trapping energy mode portion and the cutoff portion is disposed and the region having the first IDT electrode provided thereon and a region between the first IDT electrode and the cutoff portion are set as a first propagation mode portion through which the first elastic wave propagates.

The already described isolation zone is provided along the first propagation mode portion and in the isolation zone a cutout portion is formed at a position between for example the first IDT electrode and the cutoff portion . As a result it makes it possible to propagate part of the SAW propagating through a side of the region R toward a side of a region R second elastic wave waveguide having the second IDT electrode provided thereon through the cutout portion . In other words the region R constituting the second elastic wave waveguide is disposed adjacently in a direction perpendicular to a traveling direction of the first elastic wave in the region R being the first elastic wave waveguide.

The operation of the elastic wave resonator as constituted above will be explained with reference to . When an electrical signal is input the SAW first elastic wave excited in the first IDT electrode propagates through the first elastic wave waveguide region R where the first propagation mode portion is provided toward the recessed portion . Then the SAW having a resonant frequency in the trapping energy mode portion is mode converted to a second elastic wave in a trapping energy mode to resonate in the trapping energy mode portion .

At this time as for a reflected wave generated after the first elastic wave is reflected in the cutoff portion and the trapping energy mode portion a reflected amount thereof changes in accordance with a state of the resonance in the trapping energy mode portion so that a frequency characteristic in which the resonance in the trapping energy mode portion is affected can be obtained by receiving the above reflected wave in the second IDT electrode . The elastic wave resonator according to an embodiment operates based on such a principle and can be used for frequency control and frequency selection.

Returning to the explanation of the operation of the elastic wave resonator out of the first elastic wave the elastic wave in the propagation mode third elastic wave reflected in the cutoff portion spreads radially from the cutoff portion but out of the above most of the SAW propagating toward the region R second elastic wave waveguide where the second IDT electrode is provided is reflected in the isolation zone . However the cutout portion is provided in the isolation zone as described already and thus part of the SAW that reaches the isolation zone passes through the cutout portion to enter the region R.

The SAW third elastic wave that passes through the cutout portion in this manner propagates in the region R through the cutout portion . When the SAW reaches the second IDT electrode it can be taken out as an electrical signal independently of the first elastic wave.

In the elastic wave resonator according to by using difference in the propagation directions of the first elastic wave and the third elastic wave in this manner the third elastic wave is taken out independently.

That is in this example a region ranging from a position of an outer end of the recessed portion to a region where the second IDT electrode is provided through the cutout portion corresponds to a second propagation mode portion . Further the second IDT electrode is not limited to the case of being disposed on the left of the cutout portion as illustrated in and may also be disposed on the right. Further as illustrated in second IDT electrodes are provided on both the right and left when seen from a cutout portion and output may also be obtained from one side of either the second IDT electrode or the second IDT electrode

Still another variation of each of the elastic wave resonators and described above will be explained which is illustrated as a variation of the elastic wave resonator illustrated in in the following example . The cross sectional shape of the trapping energy mode portion as illustrated in and so on is not limited to the case when it is formed in a rectangular shape and as illustrated in an elastic wave resonator in for example a trapping energy mode portion may also be formed in a plano convex lens plano convex shape. As illustrated in the trapping energy mode being for example the Smode exhibits a bell shaped displacement distribution and thus when the trapping energy mode portion is formed in a shape corresponding to the above displacement distribution the elastic wave in the trapping energy mode second elastic wave can be excited efficiently. In the above case the plano convex lens shape may be formed in a manner to form an image sensor of a CCD Charged Coupled Device . Further it is a matter of course that the trapping energy mode portion is not limited to the plano convex lens shape and it may also be formed in a biconvex lens biconvex shape.

Further a trapping energy mode portion as illustrated in an elastic wave resonator in may also be formed in a recessed portion provided with tapered surfaces formed by for example anisotropic etching or the like or as illustrated in an elastic wave resonator in a trapping energy mode portion may also project in a terrace shape on a front surface opposite to a recessed portion . Further a recessed portion as illustrated in an elastic wave resonator in may also be formed to cross an entire bottom surface side of a region having a trapping energy mode portion and a cutoff portion provided therein of a piezoelectric body .

The planar shape of the trapping energy mode portion is also not limited to the quadrangle such as a square or a rectangle and as is an elastic wave resonator in it may also be a pentagon or a polygon with more than five sides a circle an elastic wave resonator in or an ellipse an elastic wave resonator in . In the case of the polygon such as the previously described quadrangle or a hexagon if the trapping energy mode portion is formed in a manner that respective sides of the planar shape come to the same dispositions in the case when the trapping energy mode portion is rotated to 180 seen from the upper surface side as well it is efficient to excite the elastic wave in the trapping energy mode. However the above does not exclude the case when the planar shape of the trapping energy mode portion is formed in a polygon having an odd number of sides such as a triangle.

Further when the IDT electrodes to be provided on the first and second propagation mode portions are constituted as a uni directional transducer electrode UDT electrode it is possible to propagate the SAW to the trapping energy mode portion efficiently. In an elastic wave resonator illustrated in floating electrode type UDT electrodes are illustrated as the first and second IDT electrodes but the type of the UDT electrode is not limited to the above and any type such as one provided with a distributed acoustic reflection transducer DART may also be applied. Further if at least one of the first and second IDT electrodes is also set as the UDT electrode the above effect can be obtained.

Further in the embodiment illustrated in and so on there is described an example where the first propagation mode portion and the second propagation mode portion are formed to sandwich the trapping energy mode portion and the cutoff portion and the IDT electrode for input is provided at the end of the first propagation mode portion and the IDT electrode for output is provided at the end of the second propagation mode portion respectively but the embodiment may also be constituted in a manner that the first propagation mode portion is used as the second propagation mode portion. In the above case such as an elastic wave resonator illustrated in it is only necessary that a bus bar on one side of a first IDT electrode provided on an upper surface on a first propagation mode portion side is connected to an input terminal and a bas bar on the other side is connected to an output terminal resulting that the elastic wave resonator can be further miniaturized.

Further the piezoelectric body is not limited to the case when it is formed on a side of lower surfaces of the IDT electrodes . As is an elastic wave resonator illustrated in for example it is also preferable that piezoelectric films are stacked on a side of upper surfaces of IDT electrodes and an interconversion of a SAW and an electrical signal is performed. In the above case each of a medium provided on a side of lower surfaces of the IDT electrodes and propagating a SAW therethrough a trapping energy mode portion and a cutoff portion is not necessary to be a piezoelectric body but any one may also be applied if it is a material capable of propagating an elastic wave therethrough such as a non piezoelectric material of for example silicon diamond sapphire titanium or stainless steel being a metallic material with a corrosion resistance or the like. Besides the above as is an elastic wave resonator illustrated in a constitution that piezoelectric films are provided on an upper surface of a medium propagating a SAW therethrough and IDT electrodes are formed on upper surfaces of these piezoelectric films is also included in technical scope of the present invention.

Next in there is illustrated an example where a multi mode coupled filter is constituted by using the elastic wave in the trapping energy mode oscillated by the above described principle. As for the trapping energy mode portion a plurality of trapping energy mode portions whose peripheries are surrounded by a cutoff portion which are for example three trapping energy mode portions and are provided in a propagation direction to be adjacent to one another and intervals of these trapping energy mode portions and are adjusted to a distance with such a degree that the trapping energy modes second elastic waves to be excited in the respective trapping energy mode portions and generate mode coupling. As a result it is possible to constitute a band filter by using difference in resonant frequencies of coupled modes a symmetric mode and an antisymmetric mode for example to be excited in the trapping energy mode portions and . The number of the trapping energy mode portions to be provided in the multi mode coupled filter is not limited to the case of three and it may also be for example two. Further these trapping energy mode portions may also be coupled in a direction perpendicular to a propagation direction of an elastic wave which is a lateral direction .

Further the first propagation mode portion and the second propagation mode portion are not limited to the case when they are formed thicker than the cutoff portion . For example a trapping energy mode portion projecting in a terrace shape may also be provided in a piezoelectric body formed to have the thickness h of the cutoff portion .

The elastic wave resonators to and the multi mode coupled filter explained above are each used as an oscillator by being incorporated in for example a well known Colpitts circuit and further the multi mode coupled filter is used as an electronic component having a function of a band filter in itself.

Further the piezoelectric material of the piezoelectric body is not limited to the quartz crystal and it may also be for example lithium tantalate lithium niobate langasite or the like. The elastic wave in the propagation mode to be used as the first and third elastic waves is also not limited to the SAW surface acoustic wave and a resonator of a type using for example an elastic boundary wave may also be applied.

Furthermore the trapping energy mode usable in the elastic wave resonator of the present invention is not limited to the case when the trapping energy mode of thickness extensional vibration in which the displacement in the thickness direction of the elastic wave resonator has a distribution in the longitudinal direction as illustrated in is used. A trapping energy mode of for example thickness shear vibration with displacement in the longitudinal direction of the elastic wave resonator or of thickness torsional vibration with displacement in the width direction of the elastic wave resonator may also be used. For example is an example schematically illustrating an elastic wave resonator using the trapping energy mode of the thickness shear vibration. As illustrated in the drawing the order of the trapping energy mode is also not limited to the case when a minimum order mode a fundamental mode in the example of is used and a higher order trapping energy mode may also be used. It is also possible to excite trapping energy modes of not only odd number order modes the fundamental mode a third order mode . . . but also even number order modes a second order mode . . . and these even number order modes are also included in the higher order second elastic wave.

As for a method to design the trapping energy mode portion capable of exciting the high order trapping energy modes the case in which a simulation is performed by appropriately changing the thicknesses h h of the trapping energy mode portion and the cutoff portion the length L of the trapping energy mode portion selection of a material a crystal direction of the material and so on to thereby search a condition that a trapping energy mode of a targeted order is excited or the like can be considered.

Further in the case when the thickness shear vibration is used the thickness h of the trapping energy mode portion becomes thicker as the order of the trapping energy mode becomes higher so that manufacturing and handling of the elastic wave resonator become easy to be performed compared to the case when for example the minimum order mode is used. Further since it is possible to thicken the trapping energy mode portion as described above a ratio V S of a volume V of the trapping energy mode portion to a surface area S of both the upper and lower surfaces of the trapping energy mode portion can be taken large. Even in the case when the elastic wave waveguide is constituted by for example a non piezoelectric body material that is likely to deteriorate with time or the like it is possible to suppress a change in a resonant frequency of the trapping energy mode accompanied by a volume change due to deterioration with time or the like when a value of V S is increased. Further the high order trapping energy modes usable in the elastic wave resonator of the present invention are not limited to the example of the thickness shear vibration illustrated in and it is a matter of course that high order energy tapping modes of the thickness extensional vibration or the thickness torsional vibration may also be used.

Next in there will be illustrated an example where a microbalance is constituted by using an elastic wave waveguide which may be a piezoelectric body or a non piezoelectric body in an embodiment. As for the microbalance a QCM Quartz Crystal Microbalance in which a change in a natural frequency ascribable to adsorption of a substance to be sensed to a quartz crystal vibrator is detected to specify an adsorption amount of the substance to be sensed or the like has been known but the microbalance according to this example specifies an adsorption amount of a substance to be sensed by using a change in a resonant frequency of the trapping energy mode. The microbalance illustrated in similarly to the elastic wave resonator illustrated in the drawings for example has a projecting portion in a terrace shape of a trapping energy mode portion provided in a recessed portion . Accordingly on a surface opposite the projecting portion a flat surface without concavity and convexity is formed from a first propagation mode portion to a second propagation mode portion .

Then on a region corresponding to the trapping energy mode portion of the above flat surface an adsorption layer to adsorb a substance to be sensed is provided. When a specific antigen in blood or serum or the like is sensed as the substance to be sensed for example an antibody selectively reacting with and binding to the substance to be sensed or the like is used for the adsorption layer . Then when the substance to be sensed is adsorbed to the above adsorption layer by a mass loading effect a thickness of the trapping energy mode portion apparently increases in view of a high likelihood of vibration. As a result a cutoff frequency of the trapping energy mode portion is reduced. A resonant frequency of the trapping energy mode is also reduced in proportion to the above reduction in the cutoff frequency so that it is possible to specify an amount of the substance to be sensed adsorbed to the adsorption layer based on a correspondence relation between a reduction amount of the resonant frequency and an adsorption amount of the substance to be sensed .

A constitution example of the microbalance is explained by using as above but for example the adsorption layer may be provided on a projecting portion side of the trapping energy mode portion or a microbalance constituted similarly to the elastic wave resonators and illustrated in and so on may be used.
