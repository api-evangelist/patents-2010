A printer is a hardware device that converts files e.g. documents into hardcopy form for example on physical print media such as paper. A printer may be connected to a computer as a local peripheral device. Additionally or alternatively a printer may have a network interface that enables the printer to be connected to multiple computers over a local area network LAN or a private corporate or enterprise intranet.

A hosted printing service executes on a system of one or more computing devices e.g. servers . This hosted printing service is accessible to one or more remote computing devices and one or more remote printers over a network connection e.g. the Internet . The hosted printing service is configured to receive requests from the remote computing devices to print files e.g. documents at specific ones of the remote printers and to relay such received requests to the appropriate printers for fulfillment. In this manner the hosted printing service may enable a user to fulfill a request to print a file at a printer that otherwise may not be available to the user for instance because the printer resides on a private network perhaps behind a firewall and is not accessible to the user s device over a public network connection and or because the user s device is not configured to submit print requests directly to the printer.

For example a businessperson who is traveling on business may view a file using an e mail client application executing on a Smartphone and then decide that he she would like to have a hardcopy of the file for the remainder of his her trip. However the businessperson s Smartphone may be blocked from accessing the network on which the printers available at the businessperson s hotel reside and or the businessperson s Smartphone may not be appropriately configured to submit print requests to the printers available at the businessperson s hotel for instance because the businessperson s Smartphone lacks the necessary drivers required to transmit print requests the printers. Nevertheless the hosted printing service which may be accessible by the businessperson s Smartphone over the Internet may be configured to be able to establish connections with the printers available at the businessperson s hotel. As such the hosted printing service may enable the businessperson to print the file at the businessperson s hotel by submitting a request to print the file from the businessperson s Smartphone over the Internet to the hosted printing service which in turn relays the printing request to one of the printers available at the businessperson s hotel.

In addition to being accessible to one or more remote computing devices the hosted printing service also is accessible to one or more other hosted services e.g. web services executing on one or more computing devices e.g. servers responsive to other remote computing devices. Furthermore the hosted printing service is configured to receive requests from these hosted services to print files at specific ones of the remote printers and to relay such received requests to the appropriate printers for fulfillment. In this manner the hosted printing service may enable a user who is using a computing device to access a web service to print a file from the web service at a desired printer irrespective of whether the desired printer is accessible to the user s computing device over a network connection and or the user s computing device is configured to submit print requests directly to the desired printer. Moreover even if the user s computing device is connected to the desired printer and the user s computing device is appropriately configured to submit print requests to the desired printer the hosted printing service may enable the user to print the file from the web service without requiring the user to download the file from the web service to the user s computing device and thereafter submit a request to the desired printer to print the downloaded file.

For example a parent may be using the parent s home computer to access a photograph sharing web service to process photographs of the parent s children that the parent previously uploaded to the photograph sharing web service and that now are hosted by and accessible through the photograph sharing web service. While browsing the photographs of his her family hosted by and accessible through the photograph sharing web service the parent may decide that he she wants to print a hardcopy of one of the photographs. However the parent s home computer may not be connected to a printer or the parent may desire to have the photograph printed on a printer that has better photograph printing capabilities than a printer connected to the parent s home computer. Nevertheless the hosted printing service may be accessible to the photograph sharing web service such that the parent may use the parent s home computer to instruct the photograph sharing web service to interact with the hosted printing service to submit a print request to the printer at which the parent desires to print the photograph even if the desired printer is not accessible to the parent s home computer over a network connection the parent s home computer is not configured to submit print requests directly to the desired printer and or the photograph sharing web service does not have access to the desired printer over a network connection.

While the hosted printing service may provide access to users to many printers to which the users otherwise would not have access be such access directly through the hosted printing service or indirectly through a web service that has access to the hosted printing service it also may subject the printers with which it collaborates to fulfill print requests to many print requests to which these printers otherwise would not be exposed. Therefore the hosted printing service independently or in conjunction with the printers with which it collaborates employs mechanisms for processing print requests that are intended to restrict the print requests that are fulfilled by the printers to print requests that are authorized by one or both of the hosted printing service and the owners of the printers.

For example in some implementations the hosted printing service may require a user to authenticate him herself with the hosted printing service before relaying a print request received on behalf of the user via an electronic device associated with the user to a particular printer. Additionally or alternatively when the hosted printing service receives a print request on behalf of a user who has not been authenticated by the hosted printing service the hosted printing service may relay the print request to a designated printer with an indication that specifies that the print request is not to be fulfilled until authorized locally by an entity at the printer. In such cases the printer may be coupled to an interactive computing device that includes a display and the printer may solicit authorization or denial of the pending print request from an associated user by causing the display to generate a visual indication of the pending print request and or the identity of the submitter of the pending print request. Only after receiving authorization to proceed may the printer fulfill the print request. Furthermore the hosted printing service only may allow web services with whom previously established trusted relationships exist to submit print requests via the hosted printing service. In this manner the hosted printing service may regulate the print requests that are relayed to and fulfilled by the printers with which the hosted printing service collaborates in an effort to reduce the undesired or unauthorized print requests fulfilled by the printers.

As illustrated in hosted printing service is accessible to a number of electronic user devices and a number of printers over a network . In some implementations network may be a public network and electronic user devices may reside on or have access to network through one or more corresponding private networks. Similarly printers may reside on or have access to network through one or more corresponding private networks. As such electronic user devices may not be able to access printers over a public network connection.

Electronic user devices may include one or more general purpose computers capable of responding to and executing instructions in a defined manner e.g. personal computers including desktop laptop tablet and netbook computers Smartphones and personal digital assistants PDAs one or more special purpose computers and or one or more combinations of general purpose and special purpose computers.

Individual electronic user devices typically have internal or external storage components for storing data and programs such as an operating system and one or more application programs. Examples of application programs include authoring applications e.g. word processing programs database programs spreadsheet programs or graphics programs capable of generating documents or other electronic content client applications e.g. e mail clients capable of communicating with other computer users accessing various computer resources and viewing creating or otherwise manipulating electronic content and browser applications capable of rendering standard Internet content and in some cases also capable of supporting a web based e mail client.

Furthermore individual electronic user devices also typically include central processing units CPUs for executing instructions stored in storage and or received from one or more other electronic devices for example over network . Individual electronic user devices also usually include communication devices for sending and receiving data. One example of such communications devices is a modem. Other examples include antennas transceivers communications cards and other network adapters capable of transmitting and receiving data over network through a wired or wireless data pathway.

Hosted printing service may be implemented using one or more computing devices e.g. servers configured to provide a service to one or more client devices e.g. electronic user devices connected to hosted printing service over network . The one or more computing devices on which hosted printing service is implemented may have internal or external storage components storing data and programs such as an operating system and one or more application programs. The one or more application programs may be implemented as instructions that are stored in the storage components and that when executed cause the one or more computing devices to provide the features of the hosted printing service described herein.

Furthermore the one or more computing devices on which hosted printing service is implemented each may include one or more processors for executing instructions stored in storage and or received from one or more other electronic devices for example over network . In addition these computing devices also typically include network interfaces and communication devices for sending and receiving data.

Network may provide direct or indirect communication links between hosted printing service electronic user devices and printers irrespective of physical separation between any of such devices. As such individual ones of hosted printing service electronic user devices and printers may be located in close geographic proximity to one another or alternatively individual ones of hosted printing service electronic user devices and printers may be distributed across vast geographic distances. Examples of network include the Internet the World Wide Web WANs LANs analog or digital wired and wireless telephone networks radio television cable satellite and or any other delivery mechanisms for carrying data.

In addition to enabling electronic communications between hosted printing service and electronic user devices as well as printers network also enables communications between hosted printing service and one or more web services .

Web services typically are computing applications that are executed on computing devices e.g. servers responsive to interaction with and instruction from remote and distinct computing devices e.g. electronic user devices that are capable of communicating with the web services over a network e.g. network . In this manner web services may be said to provide services to the one or more remote and distinct computing devices responsive to which the web services execute. For example as illustrated in electronic user device accesses web service over network in order to take advantage of a service provided by web service . One convenience of web services is that the computing devices on which they are implemented may be separated by vast geographic distances from the remote computing devices responsive to which they are executing and yet the web services still are able to provide these computing devices with the functionality and processing power required to perform desired tasks for the remote computing devices.

There are a multitude of different types of web services but to name only a few examples web services may provide photograph processing and sharing functionality business marketing material design functionality and word or data processing to remote computing devices. In many cases a web service may enable users who are accessing the web service using remote electronic user devices to access manipulate or otherwise interact with data or files that are stored by the web service as opposed to by storage that is local to the electronic user devices the users are using to access the web service. For example photograph processing and sharing web services may enable users to access and manipulate photographs that are stored by the web services while business marketing design web services may enable users to generate and manipulate business marketing materials that are stored by the web services and word or data processing web services may enable users to generate and manipulate documents spreadsheets and other files that are stored by the web services.

In such cases it may be advantageous to a user of such a web service for the web services to provide the user with the ability to print data or files that are stored on behalf of the user by the web service. For example it might be advantageous to a user of a photograph sharing web service to be able to print one or more photographs stored by the web service through the web service. Similarly it might be advantageous to a user of a business marketing design web service to be able to print business marketing materials stored by the web service through the web service while it also might be advantageous to a user of a word or data processing web service to be able to print a document spreadsheet or other file stored by the web service through the web service. However a web service itself might not have the capability to interface with printers in order to print data or files that are stored on the web service on behalf of users of the web service. Therefore hosted printing service may be configured to collaborate with a web service such as for example web service in order to provide printing services for the web service .

Hosted printing service is configured to receive print requests from both electronic user devices and one or more web services and as appropriate to relay these print requests to specific ones of printers for fulfillment. In this manner hosted printing service enables electronic user devices to submit and have print requests fulfilled by specific ones of printers irrespective of whether electronic user devices are able to access individuals ones of printers over a network connection and or whether electronic user devices properly are configured to submit print requests to or otherwise communicate with individual ones of printers .

There may be many reasons why a particular electronic user device may be unable to access a particular printer over a network connection. For example the particular electronic user device may be a Smartphone or tablet computer that has access to the Internet over a wireless connection e.g. a wireless LAN WLAN including a WLAN based on the IEEE 802.11 standard a radio frequency based wireless network and or a cellular or mobile telephony network provided by a wireless service provider made available by a private service provider and the particular printer to which the user of the electronic user device wants to print a file may reside on a different private LAN that is connected to the Internet through a firewall not shown that blocks incoming communications from unknown or unauthorized devices such as the electronic user device .

Similarly there may be many reasons why a particular electronic user device may not be configured appropriately to submit a print request to or otherwise communicate with a particular printer . For example the required drivers for electronic user device may not be installed on the electronic user device and or the electronic user device may not know the correct network address e.g. IP address for the printer even if the electronic user device and the particular printer reside on the same private network not shown .

Hosted printing service electronic user devices web service and printers may employ various different techniques in order to communicate with each other and to fulfill print requests submitted by electronic user devices and or web service .

For example in some implementations hosted printing service provides an application programming interface API that electronic user devices web service and printers may utilize to communicate with hosted printing service to submit and fulfill print requests. In certain implementations the API may be a Representational State Transfer REST API. The REST framework specifies resources that are referenced by global identifiers such as uniform resource identifiers or URIs . To manipulate such resources hosted printing service and printers may communicate using a standardized interface such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP .

The API provided by hosted printing service may includes various API routines or methods that can be invoked by applications executing at printers and or at the hosted printing service . Using the REST API may facilitate integration since the API routines can be used to perform communications associated with performing print related services without having to address conflicts or inconsistencies that may arise due to use of different operating systems in different nodes e.g. electronic user devices the computing devices on which hosted printing service is implemented and or printers . Also using the REST API may make it unnecessary for printer device drivers to be installed on electronic user devices to enable access to printers or other print related services.

One issue that may be encountered by electronic user devices when accessing a hosted printing service such as hosted printing service is that differences in platforms document format variances unavailability of software and or other problems may prevent recognition of documents such that printing or other print related services are difficult or impossible to be performed. Therefore in some cases format conversion may be performed to address this issue. In such cases format conversion may be performed at any of electronic user devices hosted printing service and or printers .

User electronic devices and or web service may utilize the REST API in order to submit print requests to hosted printing service . Upon receiving a print request from one of electronic user devices or web service hosted printing service may identify which of printers was identified as the printer to fulfill the print request and then hosted printing service may add the print request to a print request queue corresponding to the particular printer requested to fulfill the print request.

Intermittently e.g. periodically individual ones of printers may utilize the REST API to query hosted printing service to determine whether any print requests are pending for the individual printers at hosted printing service . Responsive to such queries hosted printing service determines whether a print request queue corresponding to a printer from which a query was received includes any pending print requests for the querying printer and in response to determining that the queue does include one or more print requests for the printer hosted printing service transmits for example using the REST API the one or more pending print requests for the printer to the printer for fulfillment.

Using the REST API to query hosted printing service for pending print requests and thereafter to receive pending print requests from hosted printing service may enable individual ones of printers to receive print requests from hosted printing service even if the printers reside on private networks behind firewalls that otherwise would block inbound communications from being relayed to printers .

While hosted printing service provides electronic user devices and web service with access to many printers which otherwise may not be accessible to electronic user devices and web service thereby providing users of electronic user devices and web service with greater flexibility when it comes to printing files from electronic user deices or web service hosted printing service consequently also subjects printers to the potential of receiving many more print requests than they otherwise might receive. Therefore hosted printing service either independently or in conjunction with printers may enforce one or more policies in an effort to prevent individual ones of printers from being made target of spam printing campaigns and to ensure that individual ones of printers only receive and ultimately fulfill those print requests that their corresponding owners or operators intend to be fulfilled.

In particular one mechanism that hosted printing service employs is an authentication service that authenticates users and or the electronic user devices used by the users to access hosted printing service before fulfilling print requests submitted by the electronic user devices . For example as illustrated in electronic user device has established an authenticated communications session with hosted printing service .

Various different techniques may be employed by hosted printing service in order to authenticate users and or the electronic user devices that users use to access hosted printing service . For example in some implementations hosted printing service may require that a user submit a registered user name or other identifier e.g. account number and verified password to hosted printing service in order to establish an authenticated communications session with hosted printing service . Additionally or alternatively hosted printing service may require an electronic user device to submit a verified digital certificate to hosted printing service and or to engage in a challenge and response authentication scheme in order to establish an authenticated communications session with hosted printing service .

Whatever the case after electronic user device has established an authenticated communications session with hosted printing service hosted printing service may enable electronic user device to have print requests fulfilled by one or more printers accessible through hosted printing service . In some implementations after electronic user device has established an authenticated communications session with hosted printing service hosted printing service may enable electronic user device to have print requests fulfilled by all printers accessible through hosted printing service .

In alternative implementations after electronic user device has established an authenticated communications session with hosted printing service hosted printing service only may enable electronic user device to have print requests fulfilled by a subset of less than all of the printers accessible through hosted printing service . For example hosted printing service may offer subscriptions to use hosted printing service that entitle users to be able to access only a certain class of printers e.g. printers having certain limited or specified capabilities or printers in a certain geographic area. Additionally or alternatively hosted printing service may enable electronic user device to access only a certain subset of the printers accessible through hosted printing service that the owners or operators of the printers have designated as being available to the user of electronic user device . For example hosted printing service only may enable electronic user device to have print requests fulfilled by those printers accessible through hosted printing service that are owned by the employer of the user of electronic user device and or those printers accessible through hosted printing service that are owned by a commercial service with whom the user of the electronic user device has an account that entitles the user to have print requests fulfilled by printers owned by the commercial service.

In some cases hosted printing service may accept print requests submitted by electronic user devices and or users of the electronic user devices that have not been authenticated. For example as illustrated in electronic user device has established a communications session with hosted printing service but that communications session has not been authenticated by hosted printing service . In this case hosted printing service may accept print requests from electronic user device and even relay these print requests on to individual ones of the printers specified by electronic user device . However in so doing hosted printing service may indicate to the individual ones of the printers to which the print requests are relayed that the print requests have not yet been authenticated. Therefore before fulfilling these print requests the implicated printers may require manual authorization from a user to fulfill the print requests.

For example printers may include or be coupled to interactive electronic devices capable of displaying messages to and receiving input from a user. When one of printers receives a print request from hosted printing service identified as not yet having been authenticated the printer may defer fulfillment of the print request and instead cause a message to be displayed on the interactive electronic device that provides details about the unauthenticated print request. Only after a user provides input to the interactive electronic device confirming that the print request should be fulfilled may the printer fulfill the unauthenticated request. In the event that a user provides input to the interactive electronic device indicating that the unauthorized request should be denied or more than a predefined period of time elapses without receiving instructions the printer may cancel the unauthenticated print request.

As described above hosted printing service may enable web service to submit print requests to hosted printing service for fulfillment by one or more of the printers accessible through hosted printing service . However in order to reduce the risk that printers will be inundated with illegitimate print requests from web service hosted printing service may employ one or more different mechanisms that regulate the fulfillment of print requests received from web service .

In some implementations hosted printing service only may enable web services with which hosted printing service previously has established a trusted relationship to submit print requests to hosted printing service for fulfillment by one of the printers accessible through hosted printing service . For example as illustrated in web service previously has established a trusted relationship with hosted printing service . In order to demonstrate that it previously has establish a trusted relationship with hosted printing service hosted printing service may require a web service to transmit a digital certificate to hosted printing service .

As part of the process of or in addition to establishing a trusted relationship with a web service hosted printing service may require that the web service only submit print requests to hosted printing service that have been generated during the course of communications sessions with electronic user devices or users that have been authenticated by the web service. For example as illustrated in electronic user device has established an authenticated communications session with web service . In this manner hosted printing service may use the authentication of electronic user device and or its user performed by web service as a proxy for authenticating electronic user device and or its user itself.

Various different techniques may be employed by web service to authenticate electronic user device and or its user including those that were described above in connection with the authentication performed by hosted printing service .

Due to the fact that web service previously established a trusted relationship with hosted printing service and web service authenticated the communications session established with electronic user device hosted printing service may relay print requests received from web service that were generated as a result of interaction with electronic user device to individual ones of the printers accessible through hosted printing service for fulfillment. In some implementations hosted printing service may accept print requests from web services with which hosted printing service has not previously established a trusted relationship and or hosted printing service may accept print requests that originated from web services with which hosted printing service previously has established a trusted relationship but which were the result of unauthenticated interaction by the trusted web services with electronic user devices and or their users. However as with print requests received by hosted electronic communications system directly from electronic user devices with which authenticated communications sessions have not been established these print requests may be relayed to the appropriate ones of printers with an indication that they have not been authenticated such that the implicated printers do not fulfill the print requests until receiving local authorization or confirmation to do so.

As illustrated in hosted printing service includes a network interface for communicating with one or more remote electronic user devices web services and or printers a computer memory storage system storing application instructions for providing the functionality made available by hosted printing service and one or more processors for executing instructions for example from computer memory storage system and or one or more other electronic devices. As described above when the application instructions stored in computer memory storage system are executed by processor s they cause hosted printing service system to receive print requests from one or more remote electronic user devices and or one or more other web services and relay these requests to one or more appropriate printers for fulfillment.

Hosted printing service also includes a computer memory storage system storing a printer registry a computer memory storage system storing a user registry and a computer memory storage system storing a web service registry.

Hosted printing service may perform a printer registration process each time a new printer indicates a desire to make itself available to hosted printing service in order to fulfill print requests received by hosted printing service from electronic user devices. For example hosted printing service may expose an API and or a user interface that enables printers or resources affiliated with such printers e.g. personal computers having administrator privileges for the printers to register with hosted printing service such that the printers thereafter can collaborate with hosted printing service to fulfill print requests received by hosted printing service .

As part of this registration process when a new printer registers with hosted printing service hosted printing service may collect a variety of information about the new printer including for instance a network address e.g. IP address and or media access control MAC address for the new printer a location e.g. latitude and longitude coordinates GPS coordinates street address building name number building floor floor location of the new printer capabilities e.g. formats supported printing technology e.g. inkjet or laser pages per minute color or black and white page sizes resolution of the new printer protocols for communicating with the new printer manufacturer and model of the new printer textual description of the new printer e.g. a printer name an owner operator of the new printer and or access rights specifying rules about who is allowed to submit print requests to the new printer.

This information gathered by hosted printing service then may be recorded in the printer registry stored in computer memory storage system which records information about the different printers with which hosted printing service is configured to and authorized to collaborate to fulfill print requests received from remote electronic user devices and or web services. Thus for each printer with which hosted printing service is configured to and authorized to collaborate the printer registry stored in computer memory storage system may store a network address a location indications of capabilities provided information about communication protocols for communicating with the printer an indication of the manufacturer and model of the printer a textual description about the printer an indication of the owner operator of the printer and or rules about who is allowed to submit print requests.

Hosted printing service also may perform a user registration process each time a new electronic user device and or user of a new electronic user device indicates a desire to take advantage of the services provided by hosted printing service . For example hosted printing service may expose an API and or a user interface that enables electronic user devices and or users of electronic user devices to register with hosted printing service in order to access the services provided by hosted printing service .

As part of this user registration process when a new user of an electronic user device and or a new electronic user device registers with hosted printing service hosted printing service may collect a variety of information about the new user and or electronic user device including for instance in the case of a new user a name of the new user a street address of the new user authentication information e.g. a user name or other identifier and a corresponding password a digital certificate for the new user billing information e.g. credit card information for the new user e.g. in case the user desires to have print requests fulfilled at printers that charge a fee to do so an indication of printers registered with hosted printing service that the new user is allowed to access printer preference information e.g. information about preferred types and capabilities of printers and or identifying information for different devices the new user may use to access hosted printing service .

This information gathered by hosted printing service then may be recorded in the user registry stored in computer memory storage system which records information about the different users of electronic user devices and or electronic user devices that have registered with hosted printing service so as to be able to access the services provided by hosted printing service . Thus for each user registered with hosted printing service the user registry stored in computer memory storage system may store the user s name street address authentication information billing information an indication of printers registered with hosted printing service that the user is allowed to access printer preference information and or identifying information for different devices the user may use to access hosted printing service .

As discussed above hosted web service is configured to receive print requests from other web services and to collaborate with printers to fulfill such print requests received from these web services. As also discussed above hosted web service may require the formation of a trusted relationship with another web service before accepting print requests from the web service. To facilitate the formation of such trusted relationships with web services hosted printing service may perform a web service registration process each time a new web service indicates a desire to be able to access the services provided by hosted printing service . For example hosted printing service may expose an API and or a user interface that enables web services or resources affiliated with such web services e.g. personal computers having administrator privileges for the web services to register with hosted printing service such that the web services thereafter can access the services provided by hosted printing service . In some implementations hosted printing service may require that a web service authenticate users who access services provided by the web services before establishing a trusted relationship with the web service.

As part of this registration process when a new web service registers with hosted printing service hosted printing service may collect a variety of information about the new web service including for instance a name of the new web service authentication information for the new web service and or communication protocols for communicating with the new web service.

This information gathered by hosted printing service then may be recorded in the web service registry stored in computer memory storage system which records information about the different web services with which hosted printing service maintains a trusted relationship. Thus for each web service with which hosted printing service maintains a trusted relationship the web service registry stored in computer memory storage system may store a name of the web service authentication information for the web service and or communication protocols for communicating with the web service.

Hosted printing service also includes a computer memory storage system configured to store print request queues for each printer with which hosted printing service is configured to collaborate with to fulfill print requests received from electronic user devices. When hosted printing service receives a print request to be fulfilled by a specific printer hosted printing service stores the print request in the print request queue corresponding to the specific printer and exposes this print request queue to the specific printer so that the specific printer is aware of the pending print request.

In some implementations hosted printing service may maintain multiple different print request sub queues for each printer with which it is configured to collaborate. For example as illustrated in each print request queue maintained by hosted printing system includes three sub queues an approved requests from trusted web services sub queue an approved requests from user devices sub queue and an unapproved requests from user devices sub queue .

When hosted printing service receives a print request to be fulfilled by a specific printer from a trusted web service and hosted printing service determines that the print request is authorized hosted printing service adds the print request to the approved requests from trusted web services sub queue for the specific printer. Similarly when hosted printing service receives a print request to be fulfilled by a specific printer from an authenticated user and or electronic user device hosted printing service adds the print request to the approved requests from user devices sub queue for the specific printer and when hosted printing service receives a print request to be fulfilled by a specific printer from an unauthenticated user and or electronic user device hosted printing service adds the print request to the unapproved requests from user devices sub queue for the specific printer.

In alternative implementations hosted printing service may not maintain separate print request sub queues within the print request queues for individual printers for print requests from different origins and or having different authorization statuses. Instead hosted printing service may maintain a single print request queue for each printer but include information about the origins and or approval statuses of the print requests within the communications transmitted to the printers.

At block a request to print a file is received by the hosted printing service. In response at block the hosted printing service determines from where the request was received. If the hosted printing service determines that the request was received from a trusted web service the hosted printing service proceeds to block whereas if the request was received from an electronic user device the hosted printing service proceeds to block . In the event that the request was received from an entity other than a trusted web service or an electronic user device the hosted printing service proceeds to block where the hosted printing service denies the request.

Hosted printing service may employ a variety of different techniques in order to determine whether a request to print a file was received from a trusted web service. For example in some implementations a request to print a file received from a web service may include an encrypted digital signature. In such implementations when the hosted printing service receives a request to print a file from a web service the hosted printing service may decrypt the encrypted digital signature and compare the decrypted digital signature to information stored in a web service registry e.g. the web service registry stored on computer memory storage system illustrated in to determine whether the decrypted digital signature corresponds to that of a trusted web service. If the hosted printing service finds a match in the web service registry the hosted printing service may determine that the request to print the file was received from a trusted web service. Instead of using an encrypted digital signature for authentication the hosted printing service may require a password or other authentications information e.g. a digital certificate from the web service for authentication purposes.

Additionally or alternatively the hosted printing service also may confirm that the print request received from the trusted web service originated from a user who had been authenticated by the web service prior to or as part of the submission of the print request e.g. via verification of a valid user name or other identifier and a corresponding password . In some implementations the hosted printing service only may establish trusted relationships with web services that only submit print requests on behalf of users whom the web service has authenticated. Alternatively in other implementations the hosted printing service may query the web service after receipt of a print request to confirm that the print request originated from an authenticated user or the web service may include an indication that the print request originated from an authenticated user with the initial transmission of the print request to the hosted printing service.

In the event that the hosted printing service determines that the web service from which the print request was received is not trusted by the hosted printing service and or the print request originated from a user who has not been identified by the web service the hosted printing service may deny the print request.

In contrast after determining that a print request was received from a trusted web service at block the hosted printing service proceeds to block where the hosted printing service identifies the printer specified in the print request as the printer at which the file is to be printed. From block the hosted printing service proceeds to block where the hosted printing service adds the print request to a queue of print requests for the identified printer that includes approved print requests that have been received from trusted web services e.g. approved requests from trusted web services sub queue stored on computer memory storage system illustrated in .

In some implementations one or more web services having trusted relationships with the hosted printing service only may be eligible to have print requests fulfilled by a subset of less than all of the printers with which the hosted printing service is configured to collaborate. In such cases when the hosted printing service identifies at block the printer specified in the print request as the printer at which the file is to be printed the hosted printing service also may consult with one or both of a printer registry e.g. printer registry stored on computer memory storage system illustrated in and a web service registry e.g. web service registry stored on computer memory storage system illustrated in to determine if the web service is authorized to have a print request fulfilled by the identified printer. In the event that the web service is not authorized to have a print request fulfilled at the identified printer the hosted printing service may deny the print request. Alternatively if the web service is authorized to have a print request fulfilled at the identified printer the hosted printing service may proceed to block where as discussed above the hosted printing service adds the print request to the print request queue for the identified printer. The hosted printing service then ultimately informs the identified printer of the pendency of this print request and potentially other print requests that have been added to the same queue for example by exposing the print request queue to the printer by way of the REST API.

Returning to block when the hosted printing service determines that a print request was received from an electronic user device the hosted printing service proceeds to block where the hosted printing service determines if the communications session with the electronic user device from which the print request was received was an authenticated communications session.

The hosted printing service may employ a variety of different techniques in order to authenticate a communications session with an electronic user device. For example in one implementation the hosted printing service may require that a user of an electronic user device use the electronic user device to submit a user name or other identifier along with a password to the hosted printing service for authentication purposes. Upon receipt of a user name or other identifier and a corresponding password from the user the hosted printing service may consult a user registry e.g. the user registry stored on computer memory storage system to confirm that the user name or other identifier and password match authentication information for a user stored in the user registry. If the user name or other identifier and password match authentication information for a user stored in the user registry the hosted printing service may authenticate the communications session with the electronic user device. In contrast if the user name or other identifier and password do not match authentication information for a user the hosted printing service may refuse to authenticate the communications session with the electronic user device.

When the hosted printing service determines at block that a print request received from an electronic user device was received by way of an authenticated communications session the hosted printing service proceeds to block where the hosted printing service identifies the printer specified in the print request as the printer at which the file is to be printed. Thereafter having identified the printer at which the file is to be printed at block the hosted printing service adds the print request to a queue of print requests for the identified printer that includes approved print requests that have been received from user devices by way of communication sessions that have been authenticated by the hosted printing service e.g. approved requests from user devices sub queue stored on computer memory storage system illustrated in . The hosted printing service then ultimately informs the identified printer of the pendency of this print request and potentially other print requests that have been added to the same queue for example by exposing the print request queue to the printer by way of the REST API.

In some implementations one or more users who have registered with the hosted printing service only may be eligible to have print requests fulfilled by a subset of less than all of the printers with which the hosted printing service is configured to collaborate. In such cases when the hosted printing service identifies at block the printer specified in the print request as the printer at which the file is to be printed the hosted printing service also may consult with one or both of a printer registry e.g. printer registry stored on computer memory storage system illustrated in and a user registry e.g. user registry stored on computer memory storage system illustrated in to determine if the user is authorized to have a print request fulfilled by the identified printer. In the event that the user is not authorized to have a print request fulfilled at the identified printer the hosted printing service may deny the print request. Alternatively if the user is authorized to have a print request fulfilled at the identified printer the hosted printing service may proceed to block where as discussed above the hosted printing service adds the print request to the print request queue for the identified printer.

Returning to block if the hosted printing service determines that a print request received from an electronic user device was received from the electronic user device by way of an unauthenticated communications session the hosted printing service proceeds to block where the hosted printing service identifies the printer specified in the print request as the printer at which the file is to be printed.

Thereafter the hosted printing service determines at step whether the printer specified in the print request corresponds to a valid printer with which the hosted printing service is configured to collaborate to fulfill print requests. For example in some implementations the hosted printing service may be configured to receive print requests from electronic user devices by way of unauthenticated communications sessions that specify a network address or other identifier for a printer. In such implementations therefore before relaying the print request to the specified printer the hosted printing service first confirms that the specified printer is valid and that the hosted printing service is configured to collaborate with the specified printer to fulfill print requests.

If the hosted printing service determines at block that the specified printer is not valid and or that the hosted printing service is not configured to collaborate with the specified printer the hosted printing service proceeds to block and denies the request. Alternatively if the hosted printing service determines at block that the specified printer is valid and or that the hosted printing service is configured to collaborate with the specified printer to fulfill print requests the hosted printing service proceeds to block where the hosted printing service adds the print request to a queue of print requests for the specified printer that require approval prior to fulfillment by the printer e.g. unapproved requests from user devices sub queue stored on computer memory storage system illustrated in .

When such print requests received from electronic user devices by way of unauthenticated communications sessions are added to a queue of print requests requiring approval prior to fulfillment additional information about the print requests such as for example the user and or electronic user device from which the print request originated or the number of pages to be printed may be included with e.g. appended or prepended to or otherwise associated with the print request so as to provide the entity ultimately responsible for authorizing the print request with information that may be helpful in determining whether or not to authorize the request.

As discussed above in some implementations a printer that is configured to collaborate with a hosted printing service to fulfill print requests intermittently e.g. periodically or aperiodically may query the hosted printing service to determine whether any print requests are pending for the printer at the hosted printing service. In some implementations the hosted printing service and the printer both may be configured to utilize the REST API to enable such communications between the hosted printing service and the printer.

At block the printer queries the hosted printing service for pending print requests for example using one or both of the GET and RETRIEVE REST API methods. If there are print requests pending for the printer at the hosted printing service the hosted printing service relays the pending requests for example using the REST API to the printer at block the printer receives the pending print requests from the hosted printing service.

Thereafter at block the printer determines whether an individual one of the received print requests already has been approved by the hosted printing service. For example as discussed above the hosted printing service may pre approve a print request for the printer if the print request was received by the hosted printing service from an electronic user device by way of an authenticated communications session with the electronic user device or if the print request was received by the hosted printing service from a trusted web service.

If the printer determines at block that the print request already has been approved by the hosted printing service the printer fulfills the print request at block converting the electronic version of the file into hardcopy form by rendering a visual representation of the file on a tangible substrate.

In contrast if the printer determines at block that the print request has not already been approved by the hosted printing service the printer at block requests manual approval of the print request. For example in some implementations the printer may include an incorporated display device or have access to an external display device. In such implementations the printer may cause the display device to display information about the heretofore unapproved print request and request manual instruction from a user as to whether the print request should be fulfilled.

Referring again to if at block the printer receives an indication that the print request has been approved the printer proceeds to block and fulfills the print request. Alternatively if at block the printer receives an indication that the print request has been denied or a predetermined period of time elapses and no decision regarding the status of the print request has been received the printer proceeds to block and cancels the print request.

In either case after either fulfilling the print request at block or canceling the print request at block the printer proceeds to block where the printer determines if more print requests received at the printer from the hosted printing service remain pending. If more print requests received at the printer from the hosted printing service do in fact remain pending the printer returns to block and repeats the process for each of the remaining pending print requests. Alternatively if no print requests received at the printer from the hosted printing service remain pending the printer returns to block where the printer once again queries the hosted print service for pending print requests.
