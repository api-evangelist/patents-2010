A new generation of optoelectronic devices such as organic thin film transistors OTFTs organic light emitting transistors OLETs organic light emitting diodes OLEDs printable circuits organic photovoltaic OPV devices electrochemical capacitors and sensors are built upon organic semiconductors as their active components. To enable high device efficiencies such as large charge carrier mobilities needed for transistor circuit operations or efficient exciton formation splitting that is necessary for OLED OPV operations it is desirable that both p type and n type organic semiconductor materials are available. In addition certain optoelectronic devices such as light emitting transistors require a semiconductor material which can transport both types of charge carriers efficiently. Furthermore these organic semiconductor based devices should exhibit satisfactory stability in ambient conditions and should be processable in a cost effective manner. For example a benchmark polymer regioregular poly 3 hexylthiophene rr P3HT can provide hole mobilities 0.1 cm Vs and current modulation 10 close to amorphous silicon but only under inert atmosphere.

Accordingly the art desires new organic semiconductor materials particularly those that can have good charge transport characteristics processing properties and stability in ambient conditions.

Also provided are associated devices and related methods for the preparation and use of these compounds. The present compounds can exhibit properties such as excellent charge transport characteristics in ambient conditions chemical stability low temperature processability large solubility in common solvents and processing versatility e.g. via various solution processes . As a result field effect devices such as thin film transistors that incorporate one or more of the present compounds as the semiconductor layer can exhibit high performance in ambient conditions for example demonstrating one or more of large charge carrier mobilities low threshold voltages and high current on off ratios.

The electron donating or electron withdrawing properties of several hundred of the most common substituents reflecting all common classes of substituents have been determined quantified and published. The most common quantification of electron donating and electron withdrawing properties is in terms of Hammett values. Hydrogen has a Hammett value of zero while other substituents have Hammett values that increase positively or negatively in direct relation to their electron withdrawing or electron donating characteristics. Substituents with negative Hammett values are considered electron donating while those with positive Hammett values are considered electron withdrawing. See Lange s Handbook of Chemistry 12th ed. McGraw Hill 1979 Table 3 12 pp. 3 134 to 3 138 which lists Hammett values for a large number of commonly encountered substituents and is incorporated by reference herein.

It should be understood that the term electron accepting group can be used synonymously herein with electron acceptor and electron withdrawing group .

Examples of electron donating groups include OH OR NH NHR N R and 5 14 membered electron rich heteroaryl groups where Ris a Calkyl group a Calkenyl group a Calkynyl group a Caryl group or a Ccycloalkyl group.

Various unsubstituted heteroaryl groups can be described as electron rich or excessive or electron poor or deficient . Such classification is based on the average electron density on each ring atom as compared to that of a carbon atom in benzene. Examples of electron rich systems include 5 membered heteroaryl groups having one heteroatom such as furan pyrrole and thiophene and their benzofused counterparts such as benzofuran benzopyrrole and benzothiophene. Examples of electron poor systems include 6 membered heteroaryl groups having one or more heteroatoms such as pyridine pyrazine pyridazine and pyrimidine as well as their benzofused counterparts such as quinoline isoquinoline quinoxaline cinnoline phthalazine naphthyridine quinazoline phenanthridine acridine and purine. Mixed heteroaromatic rings can belong to either class depending on the type number and position of the one or more heteroatom s in the ring. See Katritzky A. R and Lagowski J. M. John Wiley Sons New York 1960 .

In particular embodiments the one or more biheteroaryl units each comprise two 3 substituted heteroaryl units that are head to head H H in orientation to each other. While semiconducting compounds reported in the literature have typically avoided H H linkages due to the general belief that steric interactions will cause significant backbone torsion thereby precluding backbone planarity and disrupting packing it has been found surprisingly that certain compounds having H H disubstituted biheteroaryl linkages can exhibit extended conjugation and close intermolecular stacking.

For example the present teachings can exclude certain polymers where Mincludes an unsubstituted phenyl group a phenyl group substituted with one or more electron withdrawing groups or an unsubstituted pyridinyl group. In particular the present teachings can exclude the following polymers 

Another aspect of the present teachings relates to monomeric oligomeric and polymeric compounds having one or more biheteroaryl units that are identical or different and have the formula 

More specifically the present teachings can relate to oligomeric and polymeric compounds including H H substituted biheteroaryl units where the oligomeric or polymeric compounds have a highest occupied molecular orbital energy HOMO energy or E of less than about 4.8 eV i.e. more negative than about 4.8 eV for example less than about 4.9 eV or less than about 5.0 eV. For example the present compounds can have an Ebetween about 4.8 eV and about 7.0 eV.

As used herein the highest occupied molecular orbital energy Ein eV of a compound is calculated from its oxidation potential Ein V . Further as used herein the Eof a compound is determined by cyclic voltammetry. Specifically cyclic voltammetry measurements are performed on thin films of the semiconducting compound deposited on a working electrode using a 2 w w toluene solution of the compound. All the measurements are carried out with a BAS CV 50W voltammetric analyzer under a nitrogen atmosphere in a 0.1 M solution of tetra n butylammonium hexafluorophosphate in dry actonitrile as the supporting electrolyte. The supporting electrolyte solution is thoroughly purged with Nbefore the CV measurements. A platinum disk working electrode a platinum wire counter electrode and a silver wire reference electrode are employed and Fc Fc is used as the reference for such measurements. A scan rate of 50 mV S is used. The measured Evalue and the corresponding Evalue are further referenced based on the corresponding values of regioregular poly 3 hexylthiophene rrP3HT . Specifically the Eof a compound e.g. a polymer reported herein is determined using the following equation compound 3 based on literature compound 3 For example the Eof rrP3HT is typically reported to be 4.9 eV based on cyclic voltammetry measurements see e.g. Osaka I. Zhang R. Sauve G. Smilgies D. M. Kowalewski T. McCullogh R. D. 2009 131 2521 29 . Therefore the equation above becomes compound 4.9 eV polymer 3 Using the setup described above the Eof rrP3HT was determined to be 0.25 V vs. Fc Fc and the Emeasured for polymer P2 was determined to be 0.34 V vs. Fc Fc. Therefore E P2 4.9 0.34 0.25 4.99 eV. Such a 0.1 eV lowering of Erelative to rrP3HT should be sufficient to improve the ambient stability of OFETs see Ong B. S. Wu Y. Liu P. Gardner S. 2004 126 3378 79 .
