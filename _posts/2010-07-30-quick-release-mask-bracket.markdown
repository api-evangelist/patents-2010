title: Quick release mask bracket
abstract: An assembly for securing an apparatus to a facemask includes a U-shaped frame extending along similarly shaped portions of the facemask. Removable attachment clips secure the frame to the facemask. Two cylindrical pins with circumferential radiused grooves are attached to and extend from the top portion of the frame. The pins mate with bores in a clevis assembly, to which the apparatus can be attached. A spring-loaded bar spans between the bores. The bores in the clevis assembly receive the pins and the spring-bias causes the bar to engage with the grooves to secure the clevis assembly to the frame. A lever is rotatably attached to the clevis assembly. Pivoting the lever works against the spring-bias to lift the bar out of the grooves, disengaging the pins, and allowing the clevis assembly to be disengaged from the frame and facemask.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.

The present invention relates to an improvement for facemasks worn by divers firefighters or the like. More particularly the present invention relates to an improvement for a bracket structure mountable on the outside of a facemask to secure an external apparatus to the facemask.

Divers firefighters first responders and other workers that wear facemasks frequently need to be apprised of environmental and status information for the successful and safe completion of their work assignments. Such information can include details of their surroundings environmental and ambient conditions and data regarding depth orientation or status of their life support breathing apparatus.

Typically a diver is supplied with separate timers pressure gauges and other displays for monitoring such critical information. In order to access the information divers may need to rapidly attach or remove various accessories or apparatuses to their facemasks including such devices as lights cameras head mounted displays HMDs thermal imagers night vision devices and the like.

Some HMDs have been hard mounted to a helmet or a full facemask but these HMDs have not been usable with single strap Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus SCUBA type facemasks. Some specialized masks have been manufactured with one type or another of display made as an integral part. However such specialized masks can be costly and may not be suitable for other tasks or other work conditions.

Consequently many different expensive masks would have to be kept in inventory for the different applications. As the technology for HMDs advances so does their use. Thus an inventory of expensive specialized masks can become obsolete after a relatively short time.

In addition new safety and job requirements are evolving that require divers to use HMDs while wearing certain mask types. The divers must still be able to quickly remove the HMD systems e.g. for safety reasons or to pass the systems to other divers. However removal of a facemask underwater to make this removal or transfer is unacceptably hazardous so that further development and improvements of this technology are needed.

Recent bracket designs for securing HMDs make it possible to mount a HMD to a facemask using strap assemblies in addition to the facemask straps. However such designs are cumbersome and difficult to attach or remove underwater.

Thus a need has been recognized in the state of the art for a means for securely positioning or indexing displays of information and other visual aids in the field of view of a wearer of a facemask that can be fitted onto and removed from the facemask to improve safety and operational effectiveness without unduly encumbering the facemask.

It is therefore a general purpose and primary object of the present invention to provide systems and methods for mounting an external apparatus to a facemask. An index bracket assembly securely positions an external apparatus on a facemask.

The assembly includes a U shaped frame having top and side portions. The frame extends along the similarly shaped top and side portions of the facemask. Removable attachment clips tailored for the specific facemask secure the frame to the facemask.

A quick release clevis mechanism interconnects the U shaped frame and the external apparatus. The external apparatus connects to the clevis mechanism using a friction design in a manner known in the art to provide for flipping the accessory up and down swiveling the accessory or rotating the accessory with one hand.

Two cylindrical holding pins are spaced apart and affixed at the top portion of the frame. The pins extend orthogonally from the top portion of the frame away from the facemask and have a circumferential radiused groove at a distance from the facemask. The ends of the pins distant from the facemask have a frusto conical shape.

The pins mate with bores in leg portions of the clevis mechanism. A spring loaded bar spans between the leg portions transverse to the axis of the bores. The ends of the bar are contained within slots parallel to the bar. The slots extend into the leg portions to intersect the bores with the base of the slots being offset from the bore axis. The spring biases the bar against the base of the slot such that the bar partially extends into the bore.

As the clevis mechanism is moved toward the frame the pins extend into the bores and the ends of the pins displace the bar from the bore. Continuing to move the clevis mechanism toward the frame results in the pins further advancing into the bores until the spring bias causes the bar to engage with the grooves on the pins so as to secure the clevis mechanism to the frame.

A lever is rotatably attached between the leg portions of the clevis mechanism. When pivoted about an axis parallel to the bar axis the lever contacts the bar and works against the spring bias to lift the bar out of the pin grooves. With the bar disengaged from the grooves the clevis mechanism can be moved away from the frame to retract the pins from the bores and disengage the clevis mechanism from the frame.

In one embodiment an index bracket assembly for positioning an external apparatus on a facemask having top and side rim portions includes a U shaped frame having top and side portions consistent in shape with the top and side rim portions of the facemask. At least one clip is secured to the frame and removably compresses the top and or side rim portions between the frame and the clip. Two or more holding pins are spaced apart and affixed to the frame. The pins extend orthogonally from the frame in a direction away from the facemask. A clevis mechanism has bores formed therein and each of the pins is accepted into one of the bores. The pins are releasably secured within the bores. The apparatus is secured to the clevis mechanism.

In one embodiment a circumferential radiused groove is formed in each of the pins at a distance from the frame and the ends of the pins distant from the frame are frusto conically shaped. A movable retaining bar is positioned transverse to and intersecting the bores in the clevis mechanism. The retaining bar is spring biased to reside at least partially in the bores. As the ends of the pins are moved into the bores the ends displace the retaining bar from the bores. As the pins advance further into the bores the bar engages with the groove in each pin to secure the clevis mechanism to the frame. A lever is pivotally attached to the clevis mechanism with a first end of the lever in contact with the bar. Pivoting the lever results in the first end of the lever disengaging the bar from the grooves.

In one embodiment the clevis mechanism includes a base portion housing the bores and positioned adjacent the frame when the pins are secured within the bores. Appendages extend orthogonally from the base portion with the bores extending through the base portion into the appendages. An apparatus bolt removably extends through the appendages and secures the apparatus between the appendages.

In one embodiment a movable retaining bar spans transverse to and between the appendages. The ends of the bar extend into slots formed on opposed faces of the appendages. The slots and the ends of the bar intersect the bores in the appendages. At least one spring is positioned in each of the slots to bias the bar to reside at least partially in the bores. Movement of the frusto conical ends of the pins into the bores displaces the retaining bar from the bores against the spring bias. The spring biases the bar to engage the grooves in the pins when the grooves are positioned in the slots. The engagement of the grooves by the bar secures the clevis mechanism to the frame.

In one embodiment each clip includes a first leg orthogonal to the frame and positioned adjacent to the top or side rim portions of the facemask and having at least one threaded bore formed therein. The clip includes a second leg orthogonal to the first leg and extending a distance in a direction toward the facemask so as to position the top or side rim portion between the frame and the second leg. A compression bolt extends through the frame and engages with each of the threaded bores. Threading the bolt into the bore compresses the top or side rim portion between the frame and the second leg.

Referring now to there is shown a schematic side view of index bracket assembly attached to a representative SCUBA facemask shown in phantom . It will be understood by those of skill in the art that the exact configuration of index bracket assembly will depend on the specific facemask to which assembly will be attached. However the features of assembly described hereinafter apply equally to a multitude of facemask configurations.

U shaped frame of assembly has a top portion and side portions that generally conform to the shape of facemask . Frame is configured such that when pressed against facemask the obstruction of the diver s view through facemask is minimized.

Referring also to there is shown a top view of the assembly with frame attached to mask . Clips are removably attached to and extend a distance along leg portions of frame and secure frame to facemask . For the exemplary embodiment illustrated in but not for limitation clips are L shaped having first legs orthogonal to frame and second legs distant from frame and extending in a plane parallel to the plane of frame .

A width of leg portions is such that leg portions and first legs of clips extend beyond the perimeter of facemask . Bolts extend through leg portions and mate with threaded bores in first legs . As bolts are tightened into threaded bores second legs are drawn towards frame such that rim portions of facemask are compressed between second legs and frame leg portions . In this manner frame is held securely against facemask .

It will be understood by those of skill in the art that the exact configuration of clips will depend on the specific facemask to which frame is attached. In addition the foregoing description is not intended to limit the manner in which clips secure frame to facemask . Additional examples by which clips secure frame include clips being spring loaded clips draw bolt latch clips cam latch clips or other clip designs known in the art.

Two cylindrical holding pins are spaced apart and affixed at top portion of frame . Pins extend orthogonally from top portion in a direction away from facemask . Circumferential radiused grooves are formed in pins at a distance from facemask . Ends of pins distant from facemask have a frusto conical shape.

Pins mate with bores in clevis mechanism not shown in for clarity . External accessory is secured between clevis appendages in a manner known in the art to provide for flipping accessory up and down swiveling accessory or rotating accessory with one hand.

Referring also to there is shown a cross sectional view taken at line of . For clarity only a part of side portion of frame is shown and facemask is not shown in . For the exemplary embodiment shown in bolt secures accessory between appendages . Spring loaded bar spans between appendages transverse to axis X X of bores . Ends of bar are contained within slots formed in appendages parallel to bar . Slots extend into appendages to intersect bores with base of slots being offset from axis X X of bores . Spring biases bar against base of slot such that bar partially extends into bores .

As clevis mechanism is moved toward frame in the direction of arrow pins extend into bores until frusto conical ends of pins encounter bar . Further movement of clevis mechanism toward frame results in frusto conical ends displacing bar from bores . Continuing to move clevis mechanism toward frame results in pins further advancing into bores until spring biases bar to engage with grooves on pins so as to secure clevis mechanism to frame with clevis base being held against frame .

Lever is rotatably attached between appendages of clevis mechanism so as to pivot about axis Y Y parallel to and offset from bar . When pivoted about axis Y Y in a direction indicated by arrow end of lever contacts bar and works against the bias of spring to lift bar out of grooves on pins . With bar disengaged from grooves clevis mechanism can be moved away from frame to retract pins from bores and disengage clevis mechanism from frame .

What have thus been described are systems and methods for securing external apparatuses camera light compass head mounted display or the like to a facemask while retaining the ability to remove the apparatuses quickly without dislodging or removing the mask. Index bracket assembly provides a means to give facemask wearers an option for selectively viewing information e.g. data provided by the external apparatuses that can help in the performance of a task. Different external apparatuses can be connected to index bracket assembly for different tasks and the requirement for an inventory of different facemask structures is eliminated. Therefore index bracket assembly as disclosed herein is not to be construed as limiting but rather is intended to be demonstrative of this inventive concept.

Unlike prior art index brackets the quick release feature embodied in pins bores bar and lever allows an operator to put on or remove an apparatus with one hand and without removing his her mask. Each apparatus can be mounted on a clevis mechanism ready for operation without requiring the cumbersome underwater operation of unbolting the apparatus from the clevis mechanism.

Additionally clips provide for rigid attachment of the index bracket to the facemask. Clips provide a significant improvement over securing the index frame with head straps as in prior art index brackets. The head strap method can allow excessive movement of the apparatus relative to the dive mask and in the case of critical alignment requirements allows too much slop and movement for practical functionality.

Many modifications and variations of the present invention may become apparent in light of the above teachings. For example with some facemask configurations bar may be readily accessible to the user. With such configurations the user can directly move bar against the bias of spring without the need for lever to lift bar out of grooves . Further as described hereinbefore the configuration of clips can be varied to suit the particular facemask to be used and the connection of clevis mechanism to apparatus can be varied to suit the particular apparatus to be used.

It will be understood that many additional changes in details materials steps and arrangements of parts which have been described herein and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims.
