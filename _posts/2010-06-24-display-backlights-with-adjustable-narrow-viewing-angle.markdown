title: Display backlights with adjustable narrow viewing angle
abstract: Display components (e.g., liquid crystal displays (LCDs)) are viewable at different viewing angles, for example, by a first user positioned directly in front of the display and by a second user positioned to one side of the display. Many displays present a consistent display across a wide range of viewing angles, but these displays may consume energy and/or compromise user privacy. Presented herein are configurations of backlights for display devices featuring an adjustable viewing angle, such that a user may select a narrower viewing angle in usage scenarios involving power consumption or privacy, and may select a wider viewing angle in usage scenarios involving plentiful power and fewer privacy concerns. Such configurations may include multiple banks of backlight lamps generating backlight at different viewing angles; an electrowetting electrode as an adjustable collimator; adjustable diffusers that may adjustably scatter light passing therethrough; and/or a combination of such adjustable elements.

Within the field of electronics many devices feature a display component that may present visual output of the device with the assistance of a backlight. For example in a liquid crystal device LCD an array of liquid crystals may be electrically switched between a transparent state and a reflective or absorptive state that correspondingly transmits or blocks light emitted from a backlight positioned behind the liquid crystal array thereby permitting the display of visual units such as pixels in order to present visual output. Various display configurations and backlights may confer upon the display device various features e.g. display brightness or contrast power conservation color depth high resolution or refresh rate or visual depth associated with a three dimensional presentation.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

A particular feature of display devices that may be of relevance to various users is the viewing angle of the display device. The visual output of a display device may vary based on the angle of incidence of the viewer with the display surface e.g. a first user positioned directly in front of the display and viewing the display at a zero degree angle may perceive enhanced brightness contrast and or color saturation than a second user positioned to the side of the display and viewing the display at a nonzero degree angle. Many configurations of display devices seek to expand the relevant viewing angle e.g. by achieving more consistent distribution of light passing through the liquid crystal array at various angles in order to promote a good visual presentation of the display device across a wider range of viewing angles. However display devices often consume a considerable share of the power utilized by the device and promoting bright and consistent presentations of the display device at a wide range of viewing angles may increase the power consumption of the device thereby reducing battery life.

Presented herein are several configurations of the components of a display and in particular the components of backlight of the display e.g. those behind the liquid crystal display that may promote conservation of power and may extend battery life as well as improve the privacy of the user by including the capability of narrowing the viewing angle of the display device. Moreover this narrowing may be achieved in an adjustable way such that the user or operating system may specify a desired viewing angle based on various user preferences and details of the computing environment e.g. the viewing angle of the backlight may be reduced in order to conserve power or may be expanded to improve the quality of the visual presentation for users viewing the display at a nonzero angle. Several components within the display may achieve this adjustable narrowing e.g. an electrowetting electrode may be included to serve as an adjustable collimator that narrows or expands the orientation of light passing through the liquid crystal array based on a variable electric voltage or several banks of backlight lamps may be included where each bank provides light to the liquid crystal array at a different degree of directedness. The availability of an adjustable viewing angle may thereby improve the power conservation and or privacy of the user in usage scenarios where such aspects are advantageous while permitting a higher quality display in other usage scenarios.

To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects advantages and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.

The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident however that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.

Within the field of electronics many devices feature a display such as a liquid crystal display LCD which may render visual output of the device. Such displays may exist in many shapes orientations sizes and resolutions and may render the visual output in two tone grayscale or various depths of color. Some display devices often present advanced features such as stereoscopic or three dimensional viewing improved performance in bright and or dim environments power savings rotatable orientations that may present the visual output in either portrait or landscape mode and high refresh rates for such applications as gaming.

Display devices often include a backlight that is positioned to illuminate the visual elements of the display such as an array of liquid crystals that upon electrical activation or deactivation transition between transparent and opaque properties in order to allow the light from the backlight to pass through the liquid crystals. Some display devices may rely on the backlight to illuminate the display whereas other display devices may rely on ambient light such as by positioning a reflector behind the liquid crystal array to reflect ambient light through the liquid crystal array. Hybrid transflective display devices may also be devised that comprise both a backlight and a reflector thereby illuminating the liquid crystal array with both generated and ambient light. Moreover the transflectivity of such display devices may be adjustable e.g. by increasing the power of the backlight when ambient light is low and or power is plentifully available to the display device and by decreasing or terminating power to the backlight when ambient light is high and or power is limited and advantageously conserved.

A significant property of display devices which may involve the backlight component is the viewable angle of the display. In many display devices the appearance of the visual output when viewed by a user positioned directly in front of the display e.g. at a zero degree angle from the center of the display may appear of high quality but the appearance may differ from that viewed by a user positioned to the side of the display e.g. at a nonzero degree angle from the center of the display. For example as a user positioned in line with the center of the display moves laterally the appearance may lose brightness contrast color saturation or clarity. This reduced quality often arises from the configuration of the display device and in particular the backlight such that the light delivered by the backlight onto the display surface e.g. a liquid crystal array is inconsistent with more light being emitted directly through the display surface at a zero degree angle than being emitted at an angle through the display surface at a nonzero degree angle. Furthermore the amount of light comprising the visual output may continue to diminish as the user continues to move laterally further reducing the quality of the presentation to unviewable quality levels e.g. visual output with such low contrast that shapes and text cannot be accurately or fully perceived. 

In the exemplary scenario of the lamps emit light in many directions. The light passing through the display surface at an angle allows a user positioned along the same angle to view the visual presentation . However the lamps often do not emit light in many directions at the same brightness. For example light emitted directly toward the display surface may be brighter than light emitted toward the display surface at a moderate angle which may be brighter than light emitted toward the display surface at a steep angle. Accordingly the first user positioned at a zero degree angle with respect to the center of the display may perceive the visual presentation at full brightness color saturation and or contrast however the second user positioned at a moderately nonzero viewing angle with respect to the center of the display may perceive the visual presentation with reduced quality e.g. black colors may appear less black light colors may appear dimmer colors may appear less saturated and contrast between shapes may be reduced and the third user positioned at a large nonzero viewing angle with respect to the center of the display may perceive the visual presentation with greatly reduced quality.

The inconsistent quality of the visual presentation at various viewing angles is often perceived as a drawback of the display . For example the users in the exemplary scenario of may wish to view the visual presentation together such as an audience of a video shown on an LCD display and users seated at the peripheries of the viewing area may perceive a significantly lower quality visual presentation than users seated in the center of the viewing area. In order to reduce this inconsistency displays may be designed in alternate ways such as with lamps that emit light at consistent power in many directions and or diffusers positioned between the lamps and the display surface that redistribute the light across a range of directions in order to promote the consistent quality of the visual presentation at different viewing angles . Such components may involve additional cost and design complexity and may consume more power but the improved consistency of the visual presentation may be considered an advantage.

However in some scenarios this consistency may not be advantageous and may actually be disadvantageous where the user prefers to restrict the quality of the visual presentation to a small viewing angle . As a first example the user may desire privacy while operating the device attached to the display in public environments and may therefore prefer that the display not be easily viewable or perceived by other users who are not positioned directly in front of the display . As a second example it may be appreciated that the display of a mobile device and in particular the generation of light by the lamps of the backlight often utilizes a large percentage of the power provided to the device and that techniques for reducing the power consumption of the display may improve the battery life of the device. Accordingly it may be appreciated that restricting the viewing angle of the visual presentation may permit the lamps to present the same visual presentation at a zero degree viewing angle while operating at a lower power since less light is emitted at various nonzero viewing angles . Moreover while the user may prefer a restricted viewing angle in some computing scenarios at other times the user may prefer a broader viewing angle e.g. when sharing a video with other users positioned at various viewing angles around the display . Therefore it may be desirable to configure the display to feature an adjustable viewing angle which may be achieved through various configurations of the backlight . For example the display may adjust the visual presentation to promote a narrow viewing angle when the device is presenting sensitive information in a public environment and or when the device is operating in a power conserving mode e.g. when disconnected from an external power source and running on a battery and to promote a wide viewing angle when the device is operated in a private environment and or in a non power conserving mode e.g. when connected to an external power source. It may be further advantageous to configure the display as adjustable across a wide range of viewing angle such that the viewable angle of the visual presentation may be selected among many settings according to a current preference of the user .

In accordance with these scenarios presented herein are techniques for configuring a display to feature an adjustable viewing angle . In particular presented herein are various configurations of backlights that may be incorporated in a display to achieve an adjustable viewing angle of the visual presentation thereof. These and similar backlights may be incorporated in many types of devices and may be controlled in many ways including e.g. hardware processes incorporated in the display and or other components of the device software processes executing on a processor of a device attached to the display and or a user of a device. 

Several variations of this first embodiment may be devised. As a first example the various lamps may be deployed within the backlight in many ways e.g. as an alternating array of lamps having different properties or as a bank of wide beam lamps positioned along a first edge of the backlight and a bank of narrow beam lamps positioned along a second edge of the backlight . As a second example the wide beam lamps and or the narrow beam lamps may both be activated either with equal power or with different power in order to adjust the visual presentation for a moderate viewing angle that is greater than the narrow viewing angle achieved by powering only the narrow beam lamps and less than the wide viewing angle achieved by powering only the wide beam lamps . A similar effect may be achieved by powering only some of the wide angle lamps and or the narrow beam lamps and leaving some lamps of either bank unpowered. As a third example more than two banks of lamps may be incorporated e.g. the backlight may comprise at least one moderate beam lamp configured to emit light at an angle less than the wide angle of the wide beam lamp and greater than the narrow angle of the narrow beam lamp and may be activated by the light angle selector to activate one or more of the wide beam lamps the moderate beam lamps and the narrow beam lamps . Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many variations of the first embodiment of these techniques illustrated in .

Other embodiments of the techniques presented herein may achieve an adjustable viewing angle through the inclusion of one or more collimators and or diffusers. A collimator may be positioned between one or more lamps and the display surface to align narrow and or focus the direction of the light in a particular direction e.g. toward the display surface whereas a diffuser may be positioned between one or more lamps and the display surface in order to distribute the light across a wider angle across the display surface . As one example the optical light guide may comprise a film of optical plastic which may have a thickness of a millimeter or less. Light entering the optical light guide may be captured through total internal reflection but may be extracted through the use of a sheet of prisms with tips that contact the surface of the optical light guide thereby providing an extraction of light from within the optical light guide at the locations whereby the prisms contact the surface thereof. The prisms may also serve as a collimator of the transmitted light e.g. by including a lens focused at the tip of each prism to provide a focusing effect.

While components such as collimators may be utilized in many types of displays the light focusing and or distributing properties of such components are often not adjustable and therefore such conventional displays cannot adjust the viewing angles of the visual presentation achieved by the display. By contrast in some embodiments of these techniques an adjustable collimator and or an adjustable diffuser may be included to enable an adjustable viewing angle .

In these and other embodiments the adjustable diffuser may be unpowered to cause the light focused and or narrowed by the collimator to pass through to the display surface in order to achieve a narrow display angle of the visual presentation or may be powered to cause the light to diffuse more broadly across the display surface in order to achieve a wide viewing angle of the visual presentation . Accordingly in a first state of this embodiment illustrated in the left half of the adjustable diffuser positioned along the path of light between the collimator and the display surface is powered and the angles of the light passing therethrough is more widely distributed across the display surface . The embodiment in this state may achieve a wide range of viewing angles such that a first user positioned at a zero degree viewing angle with respect to the center of the display perceives the visual presentation of similar quality to a second user positioned at a nonzero degree viewing angle with respect to the center of the display . By contrast in a second state illustrated in the right half of the adjustable diffuser is unpowered such that the light remains collimated and is presented in a focused and or narrowed beam upon the display surface . The light may therefore pass through the display surface predominantly at a zero degree angle and may achieve a narrow range of viewing angles such that a first user positioned at a zero degree viewing angle with respect to the center of the display perceives the visual presentation of significantly higher quality than a second user positioned at a nonzero degree viewing angle with respect to the center of the display . 

The foregoing presentation of three embodiments respectively illustrated in present a few components that may achieve an adjustable viewing angle according to the techniques presented herein. It may be appreciated that other techniques may be utilized to generate an adjustable viewing angle . Alternatively or additionally a combination of components may be included in a backlight of a display e.g. a display may include a backlight that includes two or more banks of lamps generating light with different beam angles an adjustable collimator and an adjustable diffuser all of which may be operated in order to achieve a broad range of selectable viewing angles in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

Additional variations of these techniques relate to other components that may be included in various embodiments to confer additional advantages and or reduce disadvantages thereof. As a first variation some embodiments of these techniques may implement the display surface as a twisted nematic TN liquid crystal display comprising an array of liquid crystals having a twisted shape such that light having a first polarity is rotated while passing through the array to a second polarity. However electrical activation of an area of liquid crystals may alter the degree of twisting to lead to a degree of polarity of the transmitted light different than the second polarity. The front edge of the display surface may then include a second polarizer that passes only light having the desired second polarity thereby improving the contrast between the transmission of light through electrically deactivated areas and the blocking of light through electrically activated areas of the twisted nematic liquid crystal array. In accordance with this first variation a backlight configured according to the techniques presented herein may include a forward polarizer which may be positioned between at least one lamp and the adjustable collimator and may be configured to transmit light having a light polarity approximately equal to a desired light polarity. In non reflective polarizers light not having the desired polarity may be absorbed thereby causing a loss of efficiency and or an undesirable absorption of heat by the polarizer. However in other embodiments the forward polarizer may comprise a reflective forward polarizer which also reflects backwardly any light having a light polarity not approximately equal to a desired light polarity e.g. the first polarity of light desirably entering the twisted nematic liquid crystal array. Light not having the correct polarity may be reflected backward and may reflect through the enclosed structure of the backlight and such reflections may alter the polarity of the light . Accordingly the reflected light may have the desired polarity upon encounter the reflective forward polarizer a second time and may therefore pass through to the display surface .

As a second variation some embodiments of these techniques may position one or more lamps along a side of a backlight and or display . This configuration may be advantageous e.g. for reducing the profile of the display . Although the lamps may be oriented to emit light laterally e.g. parallel with the display surface the optical light guide may redirect the light to a perpendicular direction and may diffuse or distribute the emitted light consistently across the display surface . However the orientation of the lamps may not be fully focused upon the optical light guide and a portion of the emitted light may instead contact other interior surfaces of the display thereby causing a loss of efficiency due to unused light and or an undesirable absorption of heat by the surfaces of the display . In order to reduce these effects embodiments of these techniques may include a back reflector which may be positioned around at least one lamp and configured to reflect light toward the display surface .
