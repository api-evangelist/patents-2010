The present invention relates to novel cycloalkene derivatives and organic electronic devices using the same.

An organic electronic device means a device that requires exchanging of electric charges between electrodes using holes and or electrons and organic materials. The organic electronic device may be largely divided into the following two categories according to an operation principle. First there is an electronic device in which an exiton is formed in an organic material layer by a photon that flows from an external light source to the device the exiton is separated into electrons and holes and the electrons and the holes are transferred to the different electrodes respectively and used as a current source voltage source . Second there is an electronic device in which holes and or electrons are injected into an organic material semiconductor forming an interface in respect to the electrode by applying voltage or current to two or more electrodes and the device is operated by the injected electrons and holes.

As examples of the organic electronic device there are an organic light emitting diode an organic solar cell an organic photoconductor OPC an organic transistor and the like and these device s require a hole injection or transport material an electron injection or transport material or a light emitting material in order to drive the device.

Hereinafter an organic light emitting diode will be mainly described in detail. However in the organic electronic devices the hole injection or transport material the electron injection or transport material or the light emitting material are operated on the basis of the similar principle.

In general an organic light emitting phenomenon means a phenomenon that converts electric energy into light energy by using an organic material. The organic light emitting diode using the organic light emitting phenomenon has a structure which generally includes an anode a cathode and an organic layer disposed therebetween. Herein most organic material layers have a multilayered structure that includes different materials in order to increase efficiency and stability of the organic light emitting diode and may include for example a hole injection layer a hole transport layer a light emitting layer an electron transport layer an electron injection layer and the like. In the organic light emitting diode structure if voltage is applied between two electrodes holes are injected from an anode to the organic material layer and electrons are injected from a cathode to the organic material layer and when the injected holes and the electrons meet each other an exciton is formed and light is emitted when the exciton falls to a bottom state. It is known that this organic light emitting diode has properties such as magnetic light emission high brightness high efficiency low driving voltage a wide viewing angle high contrast high speed response and the like.

In the organic light emitting diode the material that is used as the organic material layer may be classified into a light emitting material and an electric charge transport material for example a hole injection material a hole transport material an electron transport material an electron injection material and the like according to a function thereof. The light emitting material may be classified into a high molecule type and a low molecule type according to the molecular weight and a fluorescent material derived from a singlet excitation state of an electric field and a phosphorescent material derived from a triplet excitation state of an electric field according to a mechanism of light emission. In addition the light emitting material may be classified into blue green and red light emitting materials according to the emission color and yellow and orange light emitting materials in order to implement better natural colors.

Meanwhile in the case where only one material is used as the light emitting material a maximum light emitting wavelength may be moved to a long wavelength by interaction between molecules and a color purity may be decreased or efficiency of the diode may be decreased by a light emitting reduction effect. Accordingly in order to increase color purity and increase emission efficiency through transferring of energy a host dopant system may be used as the light emitting material. The principle is that if a small amount of dopant that has a smaller energy band gap than a host forming the light emitting layer is mixed with the light emitting layer the exciton that is generated from the light emitting layer is transported to the dopant to emit light at high efficiency. In this case since the wavelength of the host is moved to the wavelength bandwidth of the dopant a desired wavelength of light may be obtained according to the kind of used dopant.

In order to allow the organic light emitting diode to sufficiently show the above excellent properties a material constituting the organic material layer in the diode for example the hole injection material the hole transport material the light emitting material the electron transport material the electron injection material and the like should be supported by stable and efficient materials. However the development of a stable and efficient organic material layer material for organic light emitting diodes has not yet been made. Therefore there is a demand for developing a novel material and the necessity for developing the novel material is similarly applied even to another organic electronic device described above.

The present invention has been made in an effort to provide a novel stable and efficient cycloalkene derivative and an organic electronic device using the same.
