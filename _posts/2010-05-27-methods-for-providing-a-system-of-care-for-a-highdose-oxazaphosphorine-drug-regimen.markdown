Aldehyde dehydrogenases ALDHs are intracellular enzymes responsible for oxidizing aldehydes. Substrates for ALDHs include acetyldehyde an intermediate in ethanol metabolism and biogenic amines produced during catecholamine catabolism. Russo et al. 48 2963 2968 1988 . ALDH has also been reported to play a crucial role in the conversion of vitamin A to its active metabolite retinoic acid Labrecque et al. 71 85 89 1993 Yoshida et al. 46 239 244 1992 .

High enzymatic activity of ALDH has been shown to be a characteristic feature of primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells in mice and humans Kohn et al. 34 3465 3471 1985 Kastan et al. 75 1947 1950 1990 . ALDH activity has been used as a marker to identify and enrich hematopoietic stem cells Jones et al. 85 10 2742 2746 1995 and to assess the quality of cells as hematopoietic stem cell transplants Lioznov et al. 35 909 914 2005 . An assay based on ALDH activity useful in enumerating endogenous progenitor cells in peripheral blood has been described Povsic et al. 50 2243 2248 2007 .

Oxazaphosphorines e.g. cyclophosphamide are latent drugs that provide a chemically and pharmacologically inactive form of nitrogen mustards cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. Oxazaphosphorines are metabolized to their active forms in vivo. For example cyclophosphamide is a prodrug that requires metabolic activation to exhibit cytotoxic activity. The primary metabolite of cyclophosphamide 4 hydroxycyclophosphamide 4 OH CPA is in equilibrium with its open ring tautomer aldophosphamide which undergoes chemical decomposition to form phosphoramide mustard a bifunctional DNA alkylator and acrolein with phosphoramide mustard being the ultimate cytotoxic metabolite. Alternatively 4 OH CPA and aldophosphamide are detoxified by glutathione S transferase with thiols or sulfates and by ALDH to carboxycyclophosphamide respectively. Brock 78 3 542 47 1996 .

The dosage of oxazaphosphorines such as cyclophosphamide and their toxicity profiles vary widely depending on the clinical indication. Fifty years after it was first synthesized cyclophosphamide continues to be used for a wide array of diseases including solid tumors hematologic malignancies autoimmune disorders stem cell mobilization and as a conditioning regimen for bone marrow transplant Emadi et al. 6 638 647 2009 .

The chemotherapeutic properties of oxazaphosphorines have been demonstrated in a wide range of tumors. Brock 78 3 542 47 1996 . For example cyclophosphamide is one of the few drugs with a broad indication for cancer and has been included in various chemotherapeutic regimens as a monotherapy or in combination with other anti neoplastic drugs for example 40 50 mg kg over a period of 2 5 days 10 to 15 mg kg every 7 10 days or 3 5 mg kg twice weekly . Moreover high dose cyclophosphamide for example 50 mg kg day 4 days has been used for the treatment of certain autoimmune diseases such as for example severe aplastic anemia. High dose cyclophosphamide was originally used in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation because of its ability to break immune tolerance and facilitate engraftment. Santos et al. 4 559 564 1972 .

It has been observed that high levels of cytosolic ALDH produce cyclophosphamide resistance in tumor cell lines Russo J E and Hilton J 48 2963 1988 . It has been shown that measurable levels of some ALDH enzymes are found in some but not all tumor types. Furthermore in those tumor types where measurable ALDH levels are present e.g. carcinomas of the breast inter individual variation may exist ALDH levels may vary from patient to patient . Further it has been proposed that ALDH 1 and ALDH 3 levels activities in tumors can be used to predict the therapeutic potential of oxazaphosphorine chemotherapy regimens e.g. in breast cancer Sreerama L and Sladek N E 54 2176 2185 1994 Sladek N E 5 8 607 625 1999 Sladek N E et al. 49 4 309 321 2002 . Other proposed clinical strategies based on ALDH include sensitizing tumor cells to oxazaphosphorines by inhibiting synthesis of ALDH or ALDH activity and decreasing the sensitivity of vulnerable and essential normal cells such as pluripotent hematopoietic cells to oxazaphosphorines by increasing ALDH1 or ALDH3 through gene delivery Sladek N E et al. 2002 .

Despite the general knowledge regarding ALDH and oxazaphosphorine drugs it remains difficult to select suitable patients for safe and effective oxazaphosphorine therapy to select safe and effective dosages for oxazaphosphorine therapy and to predict whether a certain patient will experience treatment failure or disease relapse following oxazaphosphorine therapy. The present invention is based at least in part on the discovery of certain factors e.g. safety and efficacy factors which allow for the selection of an appropriate patient for the selection of an appropriate pharmacological agent for a patient for the selection of an appropriate dosage and or for the substantially accurate prediction of treatment results.

The chemotherapeutic properties of oxazaphosphorines have been demonstrated in a wide range of tumors and cyclophosphamide has been included in various chemotherapeutic regimens. Chemotherapy induced neutropenia low neutrophil count is a major dose limiting factor in the management of cancer patients. Clinicians currently assume that cyclophosphamide induced neutropenia is caused by increased levels of the active cyclophosphamide metabolite 4 hydroxycylophosphamide aldophosphamide due to increased cytochrome P450 CP450 activity in the liver whether by gene polymorphism or drug metabolism by CP450. Accordingly the conventional wisdom in clinical practice as reflected by the product label of cyclophosphamide Cytoxan is to adjust the dose of cyclophosphamide downward if the dose begins to cause neutropenia in the patient. However neutropenia may actually be due to one or a combination of multiple factors including reduced ALDH in the patient s granulocytes and or increased CP450 activity in the liver which causes more 4 OH cyclophosphamide aldophosphamide to be produced and exert its cytotoxic effect on both cancer cells and normal cells. There has been no prior appreciation of these opposing explanations for cyclophosphamide induced neutropenia and the conventional teaching in the clinical setting to reduce or withhold the dose of cyclophosphamide if neutropenia is occurring risks under treating the patient s cancer because the cause of the neutropenia could be reduced ALDH levels in the neutrophils increasing toxicity to them. Accordingly the dosing information provided to and relied upon by the clinicians is wrong and the methods of the invention should be adopted.

In some embodiments the method further comprises repeating the determining step one or more times by obtaining one or more additional samples e.g. serially over time and determining the number of WBC in a sample until complete immunosuppression is achieved or to monitor immunosuppression.

The present invention is based at least in part on the discovery that certain factors e.g. safety and efficacy factors are important considerations in the treatment of subjects with oxazaphosphorine drugs. For example the present invention is based at least in part on the fact that measurement and monitoring of ALDH levels in both high dose and low dose oxazaphosphorine treatment e.g. prior to and or during treatment leads to safer and more efficacious treatment regimens. Moreover the present invention is based at least in part on the discovery that certain pharmaceuticals and lifestyle attributes will influence the efficacy of oxazaphosphorine drugs. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory it is believed that this is due in part to the effect that such pharmaceuticals and lifestyle attributes exert on ALDH levels in peripheral lymphocytes. For example increased alcohol or tobacco use may lead to inhibition of ALDH levels or activity. Consequently conventional oxazaphosphorine treatment would lead to administration of more oxazaphosphorine than is necessary and desirable from both a safety and efficacy perspective. Similarly exposure to disulfiram or hormonal contraceptives may also lead to inhibition of ALDH levels or activity affording the same result. These variations in risk and efficacy due to the influence of modulators of ALDH level or activity should be taken into consideration for any treatment regimen utilizing an oxazaphosphorine drug.

Furthermore enhanced vulnerability of granulocytes to oxazaphosphorines due to ALDH inhibition by agents such as drugs diet e.g. alcohol and supplements that reduce ALDH activity could lead to greater risk and degree of unwanted and dangerous granulocytopenia. While this situation may increase the susceptibility of cancer cells to the oxazaphosphorine it increases the risk of infection so administration of a reduced dosage of oxazaphosphorine or administration of a non oxazaphosphorine cytotoxic agent would be more appropriate in such patients.

Another important consideration in the treatment of patients with oxazaphosphorines is rate of granulocyte recovery which is a function of hematopoietic progenitor stem cell activity. Inhibition of ALDH activity in a patient s hematopoietic progenitor stem cells due to the influence of ALDH inhibition agents can also cause an unanticipated delay in the recovery of granulocyte count following oxazaphosphorine treatment high dose or low dose oxazaphosphorine treatment . Thus measuring ALDH levels prior to and or during treatment and or determining the presence or absence or influence of an ALDH inhibition agent in a patient will facilitate safer and more efficacious treatment regimens.

Oxazaphosphorine drugs such as cyclophosphamide are lymphocytotoxic but normally spare hematopoietic progenitor stem cells because of high levels of ALDH in those cells. As a prodrug cyclophosphamide is converted to 4 hydroxycyclophosphamide 4HC and its tautomer aldophosphamide in the liver. These compounds diffuse into cells and are converted into the active compound phosphoramide mustard. Alternatively they are inactivated by the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase to form the inert carboxyphosphamide. Lymphoid cells including NK cells and B and T lymphocytes have low levels of aldehyde dehydrogenase and are rapidly killed by high doses i.e. lymphocytotoxic of cyclophosphamide. In contrast hematopoietic progenitor stem cells possess high levels of aldehyde dehydrogenase rendering them resistant to cyclophosphamide. Hilton 44 5156 5160 1984 Kastan et al. 75 1947 1950 1990 Zoumbos et al. 312 257 265 1985 Brodsky 2 1808 1815 2002 .

Increased and dependent ALDH activity has been identified as a mechanism of anti tumor drug resistance to cyclophosphamide. For example in vivo studies in mice have demonstrated that a cytosolic ALDH isozyme found in murine tumor tissue is responsible for conferring cyclophosphamide resistance. Russo et al. 2 65 79 1989 . Elevated levels of ALDH have also been characterized as being associated with cellular resistance to cyclophosphamide in L1210 murine lymphocytic leukemia model where a 200 fold higher cytosolic ALDH activity was reported in a cell line resistant to cyclophosphamide when compared to a sensitive cell line. DeWys 50 783 789 1973 . Additionally ALDH levels in the peripheral lymphocytes that are the targets of high dose oxazaphosphorine treatment may render those cells resistant to cyclophosphamide and other oxazaphosphorines and can lead to worsened clinical outcome or disease relapse.

Although ALDH has previously been used for enriching a cell population for hematopoietic progenitor stem cells ALDH can also be used for predicting successful outcomes with oxazaphosphorine treatment by using it as an indicator in methods for identifying those patients that may be suitable for oxazaphosphorine treatment as well as an indicator in methods for determining an appropriate dosage of oxazaphosphorine for therapy e.g. a low dose which will specifically target tumor cells but not peripheral lymphocytes or a high dose which will be lymphocytotoxic but not target hematopoietic progenitor stem cells. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory it is believed that this is especially useful in determining which patients are likely to most benefit from the administered therapy.

The present invention is also based at least in part on the discovery that WBC count may be used as an indicator for identifying patients that are suitable for initial oxazaphosphorine treatment as well as retreatment with oxazaphosphorine drugs.

The inventors recognize that determining the ALDH level or activity in peripheral lymphocytes from subjects determining the ALDH level or activity in hematopoietic progenitor stem cells from subjects and or determining the number of WBC in subjects can be used to identify a safe and effective dose of oxazaphosphorine as well as to identify subjects in whom treatment will be safe and effective and to treat such subjects.

In order that the present disclosure may be more readily understood certain terms are first defined. Additional definitions are set forth throughout the detailed description.

As used herein the term ALDH or aldehyde dehydrogenase refers to an enzyme or a class of enzymes which are capable of oxidizing aldehydes. Aldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH Enzyme Commission 1.2.1.3 is an enzyme responsible for oxidizing intracellular aldehydes and plays an important role in metabolism of ethanol vitamin A cyclophosphamide and other oxazaphosphorines. Substrates for ALDH include acetyldehyde and biogenic amines produced during catecholamine catabolism. Russo et al. 48 2963 2968 1988 . ALDH has also been reported to play a crucial role in the conversion of vitamin A to its active metabolite retinoic acid. Labrecque et al. 71 85 89 1993 Yoshida et al. 46 239 244 1992 . The ALDH level or activity can comprise the level or activity of one or multiple ALDH enzymes. Examples of ALDH enzymes in humans include ALDH1A1 ALDH1A2 ALDH1A3 ALDH1B1 ALDH1L1 ALDH1L2 ALDH2 ALDH3A1 ALDH3A2 ALDH3B1 ALDH3B2 ALDH4A1 ALDH5A1 ALDH6A1 ALDH7A1 ALDH8A1 ALDH9A1 ALDH16A1 ALDH18A1. As used herein phrases such as measuring ALDH is intended to mean measuring ALDH enzyme measuring ALDH activity or both.

In some embodiments the ALDH level or activity determined is selected from the group consisting of ALDH 1 e.g. ALDH1A1 ALDH1A3 ALDH1B1 ALDH1L1 ALDH1L2 ALDH 2 and ALDH 3 e.g. ALDH3A1 ALDH3A2 ALDH3B1 ALDH3B2 or a combination of two or more of the foregoing e.g. ALDH 1 and ALDH 3 . In some embodiments the ALDH level or activity determined is ALDH 1 and ALDH 3 e.g. ALDH1A1 and ALDH 3A1 . In some embodiments the ALDH level or activity determined is ALDH 2. In some embodiments the ALDH level or activity determined is ALDH 1 ALDH 2 and ALDH 3.

As of 2007 19 ALDH families have been so far identified. Russo et al. 48 2963 2968 1988 and the Aldehyde Dehydrogenase Gene Superfamily Resource at http www.aldh.org superfamily.php ALDH7 accessed August 2008 . Both hematopoietic progenitors and intestinal crypt stem cells display high levels of cytosolic ALDH and consequently are relatively resistant to cyclophosphamide. Although all hematopoietic progenitors are known to express relatively high levels of cytosolic ALDH both mouse as well as human hematopoietic stem cells HSCs appear to express even higher levels of ALDH than their less primitive counterparts. Accordingly primitive hematopoietic progenitors are generally more resistant to 4 hydroxycyclophosphamide than later progenitors.

The term ALDH level as used herein is inclusive of the amount of ALDH enzyme and the amount of ALDH enzymatic activity. Thus reference only to ALDH level should be read to mean the amount of ALDH enzyme the amount of ALDH enzymatic activity or both.

The terms oxazaphosphorine and oxazaphosphorine drug refer interchangeably to a class of drugs which act as alkylating agents and cause immunoablation. They are generally highly cytotoxic and are often used as chemotherapeutic agents. In some embodiments oxazaphosphorines include compounds of formula I 

wherein Rand Rare each independently selected from H CH Cl or CH SOCH provided that Rand Rare not both H 

and pharmaceutically acceptable salts solvates prodrugs and metabolites thereof. Examples of oxazaphosphorine drugs include but are not limited to cyclophosphamide ifosfamide perfosfamide trophosphamide trofosfamide and pharmaceutically acceptable salts solvates prodrugs and metabolites thereof. In some embodiments an oxazaphosphorine drug used in the methods described herein is cyclophosphamide which is sold under common trade names including PROCYTOX CYTOXAN and NEOSAR . As discussed above cyclophosphamide is converted to 4 hydroxycyclophosphamide and its tautomer aldophosphamide in the liver and is cytotoxic to cells that express low levels of the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase for example NK cells and T and B lymphocytes.

Ifosfamide MITOXANAO is a structural analog of cyclophosphamide and its mechanism of action is considered to be identical or substantially similar to that of cyclophosphamide. Perfosfamide 4 hydroperoxycyclophosphamide and trophosphamide are also alkylating agents which are structurally related to cyclophosphamide. For example perfosfamide alkylates DNA thereby inhibiting DNA replication and RNA and protein synthesis.

As used herein the phrase high dose oxazaphosphorine refers to a lymphocytotoxic non myeloablative amount of an oxazaphosphorine drug. The phrase low dose oxazaphosphorine refers to an amount that is less than a high dose amount. As used herein the phrase a lymphocytotoxic non myeloablative amount of an oxazaphosphorine drug refers to an amount of the drug which is immunoablative upon single or multiple dose administration to a subject such as a human patient suffering from an autoimmune disease an allergic reaction or transplant rejection thereby resulting in a substantial reduction in or complete elimination of mature circulating lymphocytes in the subject. In some embodiments administration of a lymphocytotoxic non myeloablative amount of a oxazaphosphorine drug results in treating preventing curing delaying reducing the severity of ameliorating at least one symptom of a disorder or recurring disorder or prolonging the survival of the subject beyond that expected in the absence of such administration. In some embodiments a lymphocytotoxic non myeloablative amount of an oxazaphosphorine drug refers to a dose of the drug administered to a subject in need thereof which results in eliminating or substantially reducing the number of circulating lymphocytes in the subject including those which are associated with an adverse immune reaction such as for example an autoimmune disease transplant rejection and allergic reaction while sparing the hematopoietic progenitor stem cells. For example in some embodiments a lymphocytotoxic non myeloablative amount of a oxazaphosphorine drug is a 50 mg kg day dose of cyclophosphamide or other oxazaphosphorine administered to a subject in need thereof for 4 consecutive days. The use of high dose oxazaphosphorine for the treatment of certain immune disorders is described for example in U.S. Publication No. 2007 0202077 the entire contents of which is incorporated herein by this reference.

The term non myeloablative as used herein refers to a property of a compound such as for example oxazaphosphorine e.g. cyclophosphamide whereby the compound does not have a cytotoxic effect on myeloid stem cells for example hematopoietic progenitor stem cells. In some embodiments a non myeloablative agent used in the methods described herein has a cytotoxic effect on the circulating mature lymphocytes e.g. NK cells and T and B lymphocytes while sparing the progenitor cells e.g. hematopoietic progenitor stem cells that are capable of reconstituting the immune system. In some embodiments a non myeloablative agent used in the methods of the invention kills cells which express low or sensitive levels of the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase e.g. NK cells and B and T lymphocytes while sparing cells which express high or resistant levels of the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase e.g. hematopoietic progenitor stem cells . In some embodiments a non myeloablative amount of oxazaphosphorine refers to a dose of cyclophosphamide or other oxazaphosphorine administered to a subject in need thereof which results in eliminating or substantially reducing the number of circulating lymphocytes in the subject including those which are associated with an adverse immune reaction such as for example an autoimmune disease transplant rejection and allergic reaction or which are associated with cancer while sparing the hematopoietic progenitor stem cells. For example in some embodiments a non myeloablative amount of oxazaphosphorine is a 50 mg kg day dose of oxazaphosphorine administered to a subject in need thereof for 4 consecutive days. In some embodiments a non myeloablative amount of oxazaphosphorine is a 50 mg kg day dose of cyclophosphamide administered to a subject in need thereof for 4 consecutive days a non myeloablative amount of cyclophosphamide .

The term hematopoietic progenitor stem cell as used herein refers to any type of cell of the hematopoietic system including but not limited to undifferentiated cells such as hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells which are capable of reconstituting the immune system following administration of a lymphocytotoxic non myeloablative amount of oxazaphosphorine e.g. cyclophosphamide to a subject identified using the methods described herein. Preferably the hematopoietic progenitor stem cells are hematopoietic stem cells HSC . In some embodiments the hematopoietic progenitor stem cells are hematopoietic progenitor cells. In some embodiments the hematopoietic progenitor stem cells are mature hematopoietic progenitor cells Gordon M. Y. et al. 9 1017 1021 1985 . In some embodiments the hematopoietic progenitor stem cells are primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells Gordon M. Y. et al. 1985 . In some embodiments the hematopoietic progenitor stem cells are both HSC and hematopoietic progenitor cells.

The terms peripheral lymphocyte differentiated lymphocyte and mature lymphocyte as used interchangeably herein refer to the immune system cells which are differentiated and distinct from the hematopoietic progenitor stem cells. These can include populations or individual cells of circulating differentiated lymphocytes e.g. NK cells and T and B lymphocytes .

The terms immunoablation and immunoablative as used herein refer to severe immunosuppression using a high dose i.e. lymphocytotoxic non myeloablative amount of oxazaphosphorine for example 50 mg kg 4 days of oxazaphosphorine e.g. cyclophosphamide which leads to substantial reduction in or elimination of the population of circulating lymphocytes including for example NK cells and B and T lymphocytes. Immunoablation as described herein results in complete or substantially complete reduction in autoreactive antibodies and memory cells responsible for an autoimmune response.

The term lymphocytotoxic as used herein refers to complete elimination of or substantial reduction in the number of circulating lymphocytes including those associated with an adverse immune reaction in a subject such as for example an autoimmune disease an allergic reaction a transplant rejection or cancer in a subject following administration of a high dose i.e. lymphocytotoxic non myeloablative amount of oxazaphosphorine such as for example 50 mg kg 4 days of oxazaphosphorine e.g. cyclophosphamide . Substantial reduction can be a reduction of about 5 10 15 20 25 50 75 90 95 98 99 of the circulating lymphocytes. The term lymphocytotoxic includes killing of those immune cells by a oxazaphosphorine drug which express low levels of the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase.

The term resistant ALDH refers to a level or activity of ALDH which confers resistance of cells to high dose oxazaphosphorine e.g. high dose cyclophosphamide . By resistance to oxazaphosphorine is meant that the cells for example hematopoietic progenitor stem cells or peripheral lymphocytes having an ALDH level or activity equal to or greater than a resistant ALDH survive exposure to high dose oxazaphosphorine. The term resistant ALDH also refers to a level or activity of ALDH which is higher than an ALDH level or activity in a cell or cells for example a hematopoietic progenitor stem cell or peripheral lymphocyte which do not survive exposure to high dose oxazaphosphorine e.g. high dose cyclophosphamide .

The terms non resistant ALDH and sensitive ALDH in cells refer to the level or activity of ALDH which confers sensitivity or does not confer resistance to high dose oxazaphosphorine e.g. high dose cyclophosphamide . By sensitivity to high dose oxazaphosphorine it is meant that a cell or cells for example hematopoietic progenitor stem cells or peripheral lymphocytes having an ALDH level or activity less than resistant ALDH are killed by exposure to high dose oxazaphosphorine e.g. high dose cyclophosphamide .

In some embodiments a subject identified as being suitable for high dose oxazaphosphorine treatment e.g. high dose cyclophosphamide treatment has an ALDH at least 10 fold or 20 fold or 30 fold or 40 fold or 50 fold or 60 fold or 70 fold or 80 fold or 90 fold or 100 fold or 150 fold or 200 fold or higher than resistant ALDH. 

In some embodiments various methodologies of the instant invention include a step that involves comparing ALDH in a sample derived from a subject to a suitable control also referred to interchangeably herein as an appropriate control. A suitable control or appropriate control is a predetermined value associated with ALDH useful for comparison purposes which can take many different forms. Exemplary forms include but are not limited to for example a transcription rate mRNA level translation rate protein level protein structure biological activity cellular characteristic or property genotype phenotype enzymatic activity etc. associated with ALDH. In one embodiment a suitable control is a predetermined ALDH activity which is compared to ALDH activity in a sample derived from a subject being identified as suitable or not suitable for high dose oxazaphosphorine treatment. In another embodiment a suitable control is a predetermined ALDH level which is compared to ALDH level in a sample derived from a subject being identified as suitable or not suitable for high dose oxazaphosphorine treatment. In another embodiment a suitable control is a predetermined ALDH level which is compared to ALDH level in a sample derived from a subject in which a clinical measure was achieved for example an ALDH level obtained from cells in a subject who reached or failed to reach a white blood cell count of 0 following oxazaphosphorine treatment.

In some embodiments a suitable control or an appropriate control can be a single cut off value such as a median or mean. A single cut off value can be established for example based upon comparative groups such as in groups having an ALDH level or activity which confers resistance to high dose oxazaphosphorine and groups having an ALDH level or activity which does not confer resistance to high dose oxazaphosphorine. For example hematopoietic progenitor stem cell samples or peripheral lymphocyte samples can be derived from various individuals or blood banks and an ALDH level or activity can be measured in each sample prior to being subjected to high dose oxazaphosphorine. Consequently a single cut off value can be based on the mean of an ALDH level or activity in samples which are resistant to high dose oxazaphosphorine e.g. cyclophosphamide . Another comparative group can be for example an ALDH level or activity in a group of individuals with a family history of successful treatment with high dose oxazaphosphorine and a group without such a family history. Another comparative group can be for example an ALDH level or activity in a group of individuals with a history of treatment with high dose oxazaphosphorine having achieved maximal immunosuppression and a group having not achieved maximal immunosuppression.

In some embodiments of the methods of the present invention a subject is identified as being suitable for oxazaphosphorine treatment if the ALDH measured in a hematopoietic progenitor stem cell sample a peripheral lymphocyte sample or a granulocyte sample derived from the subject is consistent with an appropriate control. By consistent with an appropriate control is meant that the ALDH is either equal or equivalent to higher than or lower than a predetermined ALDH control in case of a single cut off value or the ALDH falls within a range for a predetermined ALDH control. In some embodiments a subject is identified as being suitable for high dose oxazaphosphorine treatment if the ALDH measured in a hematopoietic progenitor stem cell sample derived from the subject is consistent with a resistant ALDH in hematopoietic progenitor stem cells. By consistent with a resistant ALDH is meant that the ALDH is either equal to or higher than a predetermined resistant ALDH in case of a single cut off value or the ALDH falls within a range for a predetermined resistant ALDH. In other embodiments a subject is identified as being suitable for high dose oxazaphosphorine treatment if the ALDH measured in a peripheral lymphocyte cell derived from the subject is consistent with a sensitive ALDH in peripheral lymphocytes. By consistent with a sensitive ALDH is meant that the ALDH is either equal to or lower than a predetermined sensitive ALDH in case of a single cut off value or the ALDH falls within a range for a predetermined sensitive ALDH.

The methods of treatment employ administration of a drug such as an oxazaphosphorine e.g. cyclophosphamide to a subject that may be identified using methods of the present invention for example a subject having an autoimmune disease an allergic reaction transplant rejection or cancer or who ultimately may acquire a disorder such as for example an autoimmune disease an allergic reaction transplant rejection or cancer. The drug is administered in order to prevent cure delay reduce the severity of or ameliorate one or more signs or symptoms of the disorder or recurring disorder or in order to increase time to relapse or in order to prolong the survival of a subject beyond that expected in the absence of such treatment.

The terms cure and curing as used herein refer to a complete remission of a disease in a subject identified using the methods of the present invention such as for example a subject having an autoimmune disease an allergic reaction transplant rejection or cancer by the administration of an oxazaphosphorine such as a lymphocytotoxic non myeloablative amount of oxazaphosphorine e.g. cyclophosphamide to the subject. The remission of a disease or the elimination of symptoms of a disease in a subject may be for at least about 1 year at least about 2 years at least about 3 years at least about 4 years or at least about 5 years. In certain embodiments a remission of a disease or an elimination of symptoms of a disease in a subject includes the absence of administering alternative methods of treatment such as immunosuppressants e.g. cyclosporine cyclophosphamide etc. and or steroids.

The terms subject patient and individual are used interchangeably to refer to a human of any age e.g. child adult and or gender e.g. male female .

The terms maximally immunosuppressive and maximal immunosuppression as used herein refer to a treatment which eliminates or reduces the mature lymphocytes of a patient but normally have little or no observable cytotoxic effect on myeloid stem cells for example hematopoietic progenitor stem cells. The treatment has a cytotoxic effect on the circulating mature lymphocytes e.g. NK cells and T and B lymphocytes while sparing the progenitor cells e.g. hematopoietic progenitor stem cells that are capable of reconstituting the immune system. In some embodiments a maximally immunosuppressive agent used in the methods of the invention kills cells which express low or sensitive levels of the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase e.g. NK cells and B and T lymphocytes while sparing cells which express high or resistant levels of the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase e.g. hematopoietic progenitor stem cells .

As used herein the terms ALDH inhibiting agent and ALDH inhibitor are used interchangeably to refer to an agent that limits or inhibits the enzymatic activity of one or more aldehyde dehydrogenases. ALDH inhibiting agents can exert their effects directly or indirectly by reducing the amount of available enzyme and or otherwise reducing the amount of ALDH enzymatic activity in one or more relevant cell populations e.g. hematopoietic progenitor stem cells peripheral lymphocytes granulocytes etc. . ALDH inhibiting agents include but are not limited to small molecules proteins polypeptides peptides antisense oligonucleotides RNA interference molecules RNAi ribozymes DNAzymes aptamers peptidomimetics substrate mimics decoys dominant negative mutants or other means for interfering with ALDH transcription and or translation. Examples of ALDH inhibiting agents include but are not limited to those listed in Table 1 and any of their metabolites or analogs exhibiting ALDH inhibiting activity. Certain anti cancer agents e.g. procarbazine antibiotics e.g. cephem antibiotics beta lactam antibiotics containing N methyltetrazolethiol NMTT and dietary constituents such as nutritional or dietary supplements e.g. daidzin have been identified as ALDH inhibiting agents.

Depending upon the circumstances e.g. the type of ALDH inhibiting agent the presence or absence of one or more ALDH inhibiting agents within a subject can be determined for example by questioning e.g. interviewing the subject by reviewing the subject s medical file or history or by carrying out an assay for the presence of the ALDH inhibiting agent or for a metabolite or other indicator of exposure to the ALDH inhibiting agent in a sample obtained from the subject e.g. blood sample . For example when interpreting a disulfiram blood level only a small proportion of ingested disulfiram appears in the blood as the parent compound due to rapid metabolism. Metabolites of disulfiram including diethyldithiomethylcarbamic acid and diethylthiomethylcarbamic acid can also be measured in the plasma. Kuffner E K et al. in Goldfrank s Toxicologic Emergencies 7Edition Chapter 65 Disulfiram and Disulfiram like Reactions Goldfrank L R et al. eds. p. 976 . Other surrogate markers of disulfiram ingestion include carbon disulfide on the breath and diethylamine in the urine.

As used herein the terms ALDH activating agent ALDH activator ALDH inducing agent and ALDH inducer are used interchangeably to refer to an agent that enhances or increases the enzymatic activity of one or more aldehyde dehydrogenases. ALDH activating agents can exert their effects directly or indirectly by increasing the amount of available enzyme and or otherwise increasing ALDH enzymatic activity in one or more relevant cell populations e.g. hematopoietic progenitor stem cells peripheral lymphocytes granulocytes etc. . Examples of ALDH activating agents include but are not limited to those listed in Table 2 and any of their metabolites or analogs exhibiting ALDH activating activity. Depending upon the circumstances e.g. the type of ALDH activating agent the presence or absence of one or more ALDH activating agents within a subject can be determined for example by questioning the subject by reviewing the subject s medical file or history or by carrying out an assay for the presence of the ALDH activating agent or for a metabolite or other indicator of exposure to the ALDH activating agent in a sample obtained from the subject e.g. blood sample .

The terms ALDH modulators and ALDH modulatory agents are used herein interchangeably to refer to both ALDH inhibiting agents and ALDH activating agents. ALDH modulators can be potentially any substance molecule element compound entity or combination thereof. The term agent in this context includes but is not limited to e.g. small organic molecules small inorganic molecules and macromolecules such as polysaccharides polynucleotides polypeptides glycoproteins lipoproteins and the like. An agent can be a natural product synthetic compound semi synthetic compound or a chemical compound or a combination of two or more substances. In some instances an oxazaphosphorine or its metabolite may act as an auto inducer or auto inhibitor of ALDH. In some embodiments the ALDH modulator is a non oxazaphosphorine and or not a metabolite of an oxazaphosphorine.

Within the context of determining the presence or absence of one or more ALDH modulators and determining whether the subject has otherwise been exposed to one or more ALDH modulators the term determining refers to quantitative or qualitative determinations and as such the term determining is used interchangeably herein with assaying measuring and the like. Depending upon the circumstances e.g. the type of ALDH modulator the availability of an assay for the ALDH modulator or its surrogate the reliability of the subject s response etc. the presence or absence of one or more ALDH modulators within a subject can be determined for example by questioning the subject by reviewing the subject s medical file or history or by carrying out an assay for the presence of the ALDH modulator or for a metabolite or other indicator of exposure to the ALDH modulator in a sample obtained from the subject e.g. blood sample . The time frame for which the presence use or exposure of an ALDH modulator or surrogate is relevant will depend upon the particular type of ALDH modulator. For example hormonal contraception can exert its ALDH inhibitory effect for a significant period of time after being taken.

One or more questions can be presented to the subject regarding ALDH modulator exposure such as verbal written e.g. as a questionnaire telephone survey fax survey Internet questionnaire to be submitted via the Internet or computer display and interface through which the subject directly inputs his her responses to the questions. Thus the determining step can be computer implemented. For example presenting the subject with one or more questions can involve providing the one or more questions from a server to a client over a computer network. In some embodiments presenting the one or more subjects with questions comprises presenting the one or more subjects with a questionnaire on a display on a computer such as a hand held computer laptop computer or desktop computer. In some embodiments presenting the one or more subjects with a questionnaire comprises presenting the one or more patients with the questionnaire over the Internet.

Any method that can distinguish the presence of the ALDH modulator or surrogate marker of the ALDH modulator such as a metabolite of the modulator in a subject or in a sample obtained from the subject can be used. Such methods include without limitation immunological assays that use a binding agent e.g. antibody antibody fragment receptor ligand etc. to detect the ALDH modulator or surrogate marker thereof. Such binding agents include without limitation antibodies or antibody fragments having specificity for the ALDH modulator or surrogate marker.

Assays can include suitable positive and or negative controls. A variety of other reagents may be included in the assay such as salts neutral proteins e.g. albumin detergents etc. including agents used to facilitate optimal enzyme activity and or reduce non specific or background activity. Reagents that improve the efficiency of the assay such as protease inhibitors nuclease inhibitors anti microbial agents etc. may be used. Screening assays may be designed a number of different ways where a variety of assay configurations and protocols may be employed. For example a binding agent or other component may be bound to a solid support and the remaining components contacted with the support bound component. For example an anti modulator or anti surrogate antibody or antibody fragment can be immobilized to a solid support a sample can be applied to the immobilized antibody fragment such that any free modulator surrogate is captured and a second labeled anti modulator antibody fragment can be used to detect any captured modulator surrogate. In these types of immunological assays a simple color reaction can be used for example.

A reduced dose refers to a dose that is below the normally administered dose below the standard therapeutic dose and or below the recommended dose. In some embodiments these latter terms are used interchangeably herein as a reference point to refer to the dose that is at the time of application of the pharmacologic agent e.g. oxazaphosphorine such as cyclophosphamide recommended for use in a given setting by authoritative sources in the pharmaceutical community including the Physician s Desk Reference 62Edition 2008 package inserts of the drug product and or the Food and Drug Administration. For example if the normally administered dose is 50 milligrams per kilogram of the subject s body weight per day 50 mg kg day for a particular setting a reduced dose is less than 50 mg kg day. In one embodiment the reduced dose is equal to about 75 or less of the normally administered dose.

Granulocytes also called polymorphonuclear leukocytes PMN or PML are white blood cells that are characterised by the presence of granules in their cytoplasm. The three types of granulocytes neutrophil granulocytes eosinophil granulocytes and basophil granulocytes are distinguished by their appearance under Wright s stain. Granulocytopenia an abnormally low concentration of granulocytes in the blood reduces resistance to infection and thus is typically an unwanted and dangerous complication of oxazaphosphorine use. In some aspects of the present invention the method includes monitoring or determining ALDH levels or activity in granulocytes. In some embodiments where a subject has low ALDH levels or activity in granulocytes or other white blood cells the dosage of oxazaphosphorine is lowered or the treatment with oxazaphosphorine is halted. However in some cases e.g. in cases where maximal immunosuppression is desired targeting of ALDH in the granulocytes is desired. Accordingly in some embodiments the dosage of oxazaphosphorine is adjusted based upon the level or activity of ALDH in the granulocytes.

In some aspects the invention is directed to methods for treating a subject in need thereof with a cytotoxic agent the method comprising a obtaining an ALDH level in a sample of granulocytes obtained from the subject and b administering i an oxazaphosphorine e.g. low dose oxazaphosphorine to the subject if the obtained ALDH level is consistent with a resistant ALDH level in granulocytes or ii a reduced dose of the oxazaphosphorine to the subject if the obtained.

In some embodiments the method further comprises obtaining an ALDH level in a sample of granulocytes obtained from the subject prior to b .

In some aspects the present invention provides method for treating a subject having a neurological immune disorder. In some embodiments the method includes administering a lymphocytoxic non myeloablative amount of a oxazaphosphorine drug to the subject such that the subject s immune system reconstitutes without stem cell transplantation and wherein the subject has substantial disability observable or equivalent to an Expanded Disability Status Scale EDSS score of between about 2 and about 6.5 at time of treatment.

Neurological immune disorders include any disorders of the immune system that effect the central nervous system brain and spinal cord the peripheral nervous system or the autonomic nervous system. In some embodiments the neurological immune disorder includes demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system such as multiple sclerosis and of the peripheral nervous system such as Guillain Barr syndrome and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy CIDP . In some embodiments the neurological immune disorder is chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. In some embodiments the neurological immune disorder is not chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. In some embodiments the disorder is an autoimmune disorder.

In some embodiments the disorder is multiple sclerosis MS . In some embodiments the disorder is relapsing remitting MS RRMS secondary progressive MS SPMS progressive relapsing MS PRMS or primary progressive MS PPMS . In some embodiments the disorder is RRMS. For example in some embodiments the disorder is RRMS in accordance with McDonald criteria. RRMS is typically characterized by unpredictable attacks relapses followed by periods e.g. periods of months to years of relative quiet remission with no new signs of disease activity. Deficits suffered during the attacks may either resolve or may be permanent. MS has a broad range of symptoms. Physicians take detailed histories and perform complete physical and neurological examinations. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI scans with intravenously administered contrast agents e.g. gadolinium can assist in identifying describing and in some instances dating lesions in the brain plaques . An electro physiological test can be used to examine impulses traveling through the nerves to determine if the impulses are moving normally or too slowly. Examining the cerebro spinal fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord may identify abnormal antibodies or cells associated with the presence of MS.

Signs and symptoms of MS include but are not limited to changes in sensation hypoesthesia and paresthesia muscle weakness muscle spasms or difficulty in moving difficulties with coordination and balance ataxia problems in speech dysarthria or swallowing dysphagia visual problems nystagmus optic neuritis or diplopia fatigue acute or chronic pain and bladder and bowel difficulties. Cognitive impairment of varying degrees and emotional symptoms of depression or unstable mood are also common. Uhthoff s phenomenon an exacerbation of symptoms due to an exposure to higher than usual ambient temperatures and Lhermitte s sign an electrical sensation that runs down the back when bending the neck are particularly characteristic of MS although not specific. The main clinical measure of disability progression and symptom severity is the Expanded Disability Status Scale EDSS .

In some embodiments the subject has sustained increase of equal to or greater than about 1.0 on the EDSS e.g. an increase for a time period equal to or greater than about 3 months.

In some embodiments the subject has substantial disability observable or equivalent to an EDSS score of between about 2 and about 6.0 at time of the oxazaphosphorine treatment.

In some embodiments the subject has undergone conventional immunomodulatory treatment for the neurological immune disorder. In some embodiments the subject has undergone conventional immunomodulatory treatment for the neurological immune disorder and has experienced clinical progression despite the conventional treatment.

In some embodiments the subject exhibits sustained improvement in disability following the oxazaphosphorine treatment. In some embodiments the sustained improvement comprises improvement that is observable or equivalent to a change in EDSS score of equal to or greater than a 1 point decrease for at least two consecutive assessments. In some embodiments the disorder remains in remission without administration of additional immunosuppressive agents.

In some embodiments the method further comprises identifying the subject as suffering from the neurological immune disorder.

In some embodiments oxazaphosphorine therapy is designed to eradicate the immune system. Accordingly subjects may undergo a time of immune deficiency e.g. deficiency which is most severe during the first three months post treatment with oxazaphosphorine. In some embodiments any one of the methods of the present invention may further include monitoring viral titers subsequent to oxazaphosphorine administration. Methods for monitoring viral titers are discussed in more detail below. In some embodiments any one of the methods of the present invention may further include monitoring viral titers for at least about 15 days subsequent to oxazaphosphorine administration. In some embodiments any one of the methods of the present invention may further include monitoring viral titers for at least about a month subsequent to oxazaphosphorine administration. In some embodiments any one of the methods of the present invention may further include monitoring viral titers for at least about 2 months subsequent to oxazaphosphorine administration. In some embodiments any one of the methods of the present invention may further include monitoring viral titers for at least about 3 4 5 6 7 8 or 9 months subsequent to oxazaphosphorine administration. In some embodiments evidence of improving and apparently adequate return of immune function will occur between about 6 and 9 months after treatment.

In some embodiments any one of the methods of the present invention may further include advising a subject to stay in an area local to the treating hospital for a time period subsequent to discharge e.g. at least about 10 20 30 40 50 or 60 days subsequent to discharge. In some embodiments any one of the methods of the present invention may further include advising a subject to wear a surgical mask when indoors e.g. in hospitals doctor s offices and when around non family persons a time period subsequent to treatment e.g. at least about 1 2 3 4 or 5 months post treatment.

In some embodiments any one of the methods of the present invention may further include advising a subject to receive antiviral therapy subsequent to treatment with oxazaphosphorine. In some embodiments any one of the methods of the present invention may further include treating a patient with an antiviral e.g. therapeutically and or prophylactically. In some embodiments the antiviral targets varicella zoster or interstitial pneumonia or any combination thereof. In some embodiments the antiviral is valacyclovir. In some embodiments the antiviral is varicella zoster immune globulin VZIG prophylaxis.

In some aspects the present invention provides methods for determining a safe and effective dose of an oxazaphosphorine for treatment of a subject in need thereof. In some embodiments the methods include obtaining information relevant to a sensitivity factor of a subject selected from the group consisting of white blood cell count ALDH in lymphocytes ALDH in hematopoietic progenitor stem cells or any combinations thereof and determining safe and effective dose of an oxazaphosphorine informed by one or more of the sensitivity factors.

In some embodiments the information to a sensitivity factor of a subject is obtained before a treatment is commenced or recommenced. In some embodiments the information to a sensitivity factor of a subject is obtained during treatment and the safe and effective dose is adjusted based on the information during treatment.

Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory it is believed that safe and effective high dose oxazaphosphorine treatment depends on both the ability of hematopoietic progenitor stem cells to resist high dose oxazaphosphorine as a result of their elevated ALDH and on a sufficiently weak or absent ALDH level in peripheral lymphocytes which renders those cells sensitive to treatment. Moreover it is believed that safe and effective low dose oxazaphosphorine treatment depends on a dosage that effectively targets tumor cells while not being high enough to overcome ALDH levels in peripheral lymphocytes which would effect the immune system .

In some embodiments a sample including hematopoietic progenitor stem cells for example a bone marrow aspirate can be derived from a subject and exposed to increasing amounts of oxazaphosphorine e.g. cyclophosphamide . A dose of oxazaphosphorine such as cyclophosphamide can be identified as being suitable for administration to the subject if hematopoietic progenitor stem cells survive when exposed to the dose however are killed when exposed to a dose higher than the dose at which they survive. Accordingly such a dose is identified as an effective dose for the particular subject.

In some embodiments a sample including peripheral lymphocytes e.g. CD4 positive peripheral lymphocytes for example a banked blood sample can be derived from a subject and exposed to increasing amounts of oxazaphosphorine such as cyclophosphamide. A dose of oxazaphosphorine can be identified as being suitable for administration to the subject if the peripheral lymphocytes are killed when exposed to a dose higher than the dose at which they survive. Another exemplary dose is a dose within a concentration between which a hematopoietic cell population isolated in a sample survives the treatment and the minimal dose required to kill all or a substantial fraction of the peripheral lymphocytes in a banked blood sample.

In some embodiments a sample including peripheral lymphocytes for example a banked blood sample can be derived from a subject and exposed to increasing amounts of oxazaphosphorine such as cyclophosphamide. A dose of oxazaphosphorine can be identified as being suitable for administration to the subject if the dose is within a previously determined range deemed sufficient to drive the subject s white blood cell count to 0 following administration of the therapy. This determination could for instance come from a sampling of the lymphocytes of a similar patient population as the subject or from family members of the subject or from a previous sampling from the subject or from a model or proxy of the metabolism of the drug by the aldehyde dehydrogenase in the subject.

Accordingly a dose is identified as an effective dose for a particular subject. The various compounds e.g. oxazaphosphorines and non oxazaphosphorine cytotoxic agents used in the methods described herein may be administered orally parenterally e.g. intravenously intramuscularly sublingually buccally rectally intranasally intrabronchially intrapulmonarily intraperitonealy topically transdermally and subcutaneously for example. The amount of compound administered in a single dose may be dependent on the subject being treated the subject s weight the manner of administration and the judgment of the prescribing physician. Generally however administration and dosage and the duration of time for which a composition is administered will approximate that which are necessary to achieve a desired result. In some embodiments the oxazophosphorine e.g. cyclophosphamide may be in a lyophilized form and combined with a diluent e.g. sterile water and or sterile sodium chloride solution prior to administration.

In some embodiments treating the subject includes intravenous administration the oxazaphosphorine drug. In some embodiments treating the subject includes intravenous administration of between about 25 mg kg to about 75 mg kg oxazaphosphorine in divided doses over a period of from about 1 to about 7 days e.g. between about 30 mg kg to about 60 mg kg in divided doses over a period of from about 2 to about 6 days e.g. between about 40 mg kg to about 50 mg kg in divided doses over a period of from about 2 to about 5 days. In some embodiments treating the subject includes intravenous administration of about 5 mg kg to about 20 mg kg oxazaphosphorine every 5 to 12 days e.g. about 10 mg kg to about 15 mg kg every 7 to 10 days. In some embodiments treating the subject includes intravenous administration of about 1 to about 10 mg kg of oxazaphosphorine once or twice weekly e.g. about 3 to about 5 mg kg twice weekly. In some embodiments treating the subject includes intravenous administration of about 10 mg kg to about 250 mg kg of oxazaphosphorine for 1 to 14 days e.g. 50 mg kg to about 250 mg kg for 1 to 10 days. In some embodiments treating the subject includes intravenous administration of about 100 mg kg to about 200 mg kg of oxazaphosphorine for 1 to 7 days. In some embodiments treating the subject includes intravenous administration of about 25 mg kg to about 100 mg kg of oxazaphosphorine for 2 to 6 days. In some embodiments treating the subject includes intravenous administration of about 25 mg kg to about 100 mg kg of oxazaphosphorine for 3 to 5 days. In some embodiments treating the subject includes intravenous administration of about 50 mg kg day of oxazaphosphorine e.g. about 50 mg kg day of oxazaphosphorine for 4 consecutive days.

In some embodiments treating the subject includes oral administration of the oxazaphosphorine drug. In some embodiments treating the subject includes oral administration of about 1 mg kg to about 5 mg kg daily for about 30 to about 120 days e.g. about 2 mg kg to about 4 mg kg daily for about 45 to about 105 days e.g. about 2.5 mg kg to about 3 mg kg daily for about 60 to about 90 days.

In some embodiments the method of treatment further includes administration of mesna an adjuvant used in cancer chemotherapy by any suitable route e.g. oral intravenous . Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory it is believed that mesna may reduce the incidence of haemorrhagic cystitis and hematuria in oxazaphosphorine therapy by neutralizing metabolites of oxazaphosphorines such as acrolein. In some embodiments mesna is administered at a total daily dosage of between about 10 mg kg and about 100 mg kg. In some embodiments mesna is administered at a total daily dosage of about 10 mg kg 20 mg kg 30 mg kg 40 mg kg 50 mg kg 60 mg kg 70 mg kg 80 mg kg 90 mg kg or 100 mg kg. In some embodiments mesna is administered in a bolus dosage. In some embodiments mesna is administered in a series of dosages. It is understood that in such series of dosages each individual dosage may be the same or different than each other individual dosage. Moreover the time span between each dosage may be the same or different than the time span between any two other dosages. For example in one embodiment mesna is administered in a 10 mg kg dosage prior to oxazaphosphorine administration followed by 10 mg kg dosages at 3 6 and 8 hours after the oxazaphosphorine administration such that the total daily dose is 40 mg kg. For example over the four days for a 70 kg patient the total dose of mesna could be about 11.2 grams.

In some embodiments the methods include a measuring ALDH in a sample including hematopoietic progenitor stem cells derived from the subject and b determining an effective dose of oxazaphosphorine based on comparison of ALDH to an appropriate standard. In some embodiments the methods include a measuring ALDH in a sample including peripheral lymphocytes derived from the subject and b determining an effective dose of oxazaphosphorine based on comparison of ALDH to an appropriate standard. In some embodiments the methods include a measuring ALDH in a sample including peripheral lymphocytes derived from the subject b measuring ALDH in a sample including hematopoietic progenitor stem cells derived from the subject and c determining an effective dose of oxazaphosphorine based on comparison of both ALDH measurements to corresponding appropriate standards.

As indicated above patients who achieved maximal immunosuppression following the therapy as indicated by their WBC count reaching 0 experience a better clinical outcome and lessened risk of disease relapse than patients whose WBC count did not reach zero following therapy. Therefore in another aspect the present invention provides a method for identifying a subject suitable for high dose oxazaphosphorine retreatment comprising determining the number of WBC in a blood sample derived from the subject that has previously undergone high dose oxazaphosphorine treatment wherein the subject is identified as being suitable for high dose oxazaphosphorine retreatment if the number of WBC is consistent with incomplete immunosuppression. In some embodiments incomplete immunosuppression is indicated by a WBC count of greater than zero. In the case of incomplete immunosuppression the method may further comprise re administration of high dose oxazaphosphorine e.g. high dose cyclophosphamide one or more times retreatment until the number of WBC is no longer consistent with incomplete immunosuppression. Likewise the patient is identified as not being suitable for high dose oxazaphosphorine retreatment if the number of WBC is consistent with complete or maximal immunosuppression e.g. a WBC count of zero . In some embodiments the method further comprises measuring ALDH in a sample including hematopoietic progenitor stem cells derived from the subject wherein the subject is identified as being suitable for high dose oxazaphosphorine treatment if a the ALDH is consistent with a resistant ALDH in hematopoietic progenitor stem cells and b the number of WBC is consistent with incomplete immunosuppression. In other embodiments the method further comprises measuring ALDH in a sample including peripheral lymphocytes derived from the subject wherein the subject is identified as being suitable for high dose oxazaphosphorine treatment if a the ALDH is consistent with a sensitive ALDH in peripheral lymphocytes and b the number of WBC is consistent with incomplete immunosuppression.

In some embodiments the subject is suffering from an immune disorder such as an autoimmune disease an allergic reaction or transplant rejection including graft versus host rejection GVHD such as those disclosed herein. In some embodiments the subject is suffering from or at risk of developing transplant rejection and the oxazaphosphorine is to be administered or delivered to prevent e.g. avoid or delay onset of transplant rejection. In some embodiments the subject is suffering from or at risk of developing graft versus host disease and the oxazaphosphorine is to be administered or delivered to prevent e.g. avoid or delay onset of graft versus host disease.

Without wishing to be bound by theory it is understood that methods described herein can be used for treating a subject with an oxazaphosphorine drug and or for identifying a subject suitable for high dose oxazaphosphorine e.g. cyclophosphamide treatment where the subject has any immune disorder in which it would be desirable to replace the circulating auto reactive lymphocytes with disease free immune cells. One of ordinary skill in the art can easily determine which diseases fall in this category for example by detecting auto reactive antibodies or antibodies which react with self antigens in a subject suffering from such a disease. Alternatively by detecting cells in a subject which are capable of mounting an immune response against a self antigen in the subject. Methods of diagnosing one or more autoimmune diseases encompassed by this disclosure are well known in the art and can easily be performed by a skilled artisan.

In addition to autoimmune diseases also encompassed by this invention are methods of treating a subject with an oxazaphosphorine drug and or for identifying subjects suitable for oxazaphosphorine e.g. cyclophosphamide treatment where the subject has an allergic reaction. Exemplary allergic reactions include but are not limited to systemic allergic reaction an allergic reaction to immunotherapy anaphylactic reaction atopic disease contrast allergy drug allergy food allergy hypersensitivity reaction insect sting allergy latex allergy penicillin allergy and radiocontrast medium allergy. Examples of food allergies include an allergic reaction to peanuts or shellfish for example.

In addition to autoimmune diseases and allergic reactions also encompassed by the methods of the present invention are methods of treating a subject having transplant rejection with an oxazaphosphorine drug and or methods for identifying subjects having transplant rejections as being suitable or not being suitable for oxazaphosphorine e.g. cyclophosphamide treatment. For example in some embodiments a subject has a transplant rejection which occurred during or following an allogenic antigen transplantation of organs tissues or cells into a host. In other embodiments a subject has a transplant rejection which occurred during or following a xenogenic transplantation of organs tissues or cells into a host. In yet other embodiments a subject has a transplant rejection which occurred during or following transplantation of autologous tissue organs or cells into a host.

Transplant cells may be administered to the subject by any effective route. In one embodiment the cells e.g. bone marrow cells are administered for treatment of a hereditary hemoglobinopathy such as sickle cell anemia or thalassemia and or for treatment of a hematologic malignancy. In one embodiment the transplant is a bone marrow transplant e.g. allogenic bone marrow transplant .

Also encompassed by the methods of the present invention are subjects which have a transplant rejection that occurred during or following a transplant of an organ tissue or cells from a half matched donor which usually results in graft versus host disease GVHD .

In a further embodiment of the present invention the subject has cancer. As used herein the term cancer refers to disorders characterized by deregulated or uncontrolled cell growth for example carcinomas sarcomas lymphomas. The term cancer includes benign tumors primary malignant tumors e.g. those whose cells have not migrated to sites in the subject s body other than the site of the original tumor and secondary malignant tumors e.g. those arising from metastasis the migration of tumor cells to secondary sites that are different from the site of the original tumor . In one embodiment of the present invention the subject does not have cancer.

Exemplary cancers include but are not limited to Hodgkin s Lymphoma Non Hodgkin s Lymphoma Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Mantle Cell Lymphoma and Multiple Myeloma.

In various aspects of the methods of the invention ALDH for example cytosolic ALDH is measured in a cell sample including hematopoietic stem cells for example a cell suspension of pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells pluripotent HSC that is substantially free of lineage committed cells. By definition pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells are those progenitor cells having the ability to repopulate lymphohematopoietic lineages on a long term basis.

In one embodiment hematopoietic progenitor stem cells are derived from a subject having an autoimmune disease. In another embodiment hematopoietic progenitor stem cells are derived from a subject having cancer. In yet other embodiments a subject has an allergic reaction or transplant rejection.

Preparation of cell samples containing hematopoietic stem cells can be found for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5 876 956 incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Alternatively a large proportion of differentiated cells may be removed in a cell sample by using for example a relatively crude separation. The source of the cells may be the bone marrow fetal neonate or adult or other hematopoietic cell source e.g. fetal liver or blood. For example magnetic bead separations may be used initially to remove large numbers of lineage committed cells namely major cell populations of the hematopoietic systems including such lineages as T cells B cells both pre B and B cells myelomonocytic cells or minor cell populations such as megakaryocytes mast cells eosinophils and basophils.

In some embodiments of the methods of the present invention a sample including hematopoietic progenitor stem cells includes a bone marrow aspirate derived from a subject.

In some embodiments ALDH is measured in a sample derived from a subject having cancer where the sample contains leukemia cells or other malignant cells.

In some embodiments a sample derived from a subject includes a substantially homogeneous population of hematopoietic progenitor stem cells e.g. hematopoietic stem cells. The term substantially homogeneous as used herein means that the sample derived from a subject being identified as being suitable or not suitable for high dose oxazaphosphorine e.g. cyclophosphamide treatment includes no more than about 1 or 2 or 5 or 10 of lineage committed cells. Hematopoietic progenitor stem cells can be isolated using any technique well known in the art or those described herein. For example hematopoietic stem cells can be characterized as having one or more of the following attributes for example having a small size generally from about 8 to 10 m expressing levels of ALDH from about 10 to about 30 nanomoles aldehyde oxidized mg protein min being substantially free from expression of markers specific for committed lymphohematopoietic lineages such as CD19 CD33 and CD5 and being negative for expression of c kit and Thy. In some embodiments a sample derived from a subject is enriched for hematopoietic stem cells for example by flow cytometry using anti CD34 antibody. Other markers that can be used for identification and isolation of hematopoietic stem cells include but are not limited to c kit and Thy.

In some embodiments a cell sample including hematopoietic progenitor stem cells can be obtained by isolating cells that express an intracellular enzyme which hydrolyzes a fluorescent non polar substrate. Preferably the enzyme is ALDH and the substrate is DAAA as described herein. In other embodiments the cell sorting step is performed using automated cell sorting such as fluorescence activated cell sorting FACS a high speed method of sorting fluorescent cells.

In various aspects of the methods of the invention ALDH for example cytosolic ALDH is measured in a cell sample including peripheral lymphocytes for example a cell suspension substantially enriched of lineage committed immune cells. By definition these lymphocytes originate from a common lymphoid progenitor and form the innate and humoral immune system. These cells are commonly referred to as T cells B cells and natural killer NK cells white blood cell and or dendritic cells. These include such lineages as T cells B cells both pre B and B cells myelomonocytic cells or minor cell populations such as megakaryocytes mast cells eosinophils and basophils.

In some embodiments the peripheral lymphocytes are CD4 positive also known as helper T cells CD4 positive lymphocytes or CD4 positive T cells . In addition to flow based assays e.g. flow cytometry such as fluorescence activated cell sorting FACS any of various non flow cytometric technologies may be utilized such as manual assays using optical or fluorescence microscopes e.g. Dynal immune bead based assay Coulter immune bead based assay etc. Pattanapanysat K et al. 2005 65 1 29 36 Pattanapanysat K. and Thakar M. R. 2005 121 4 539 549 Paxton H. et al. 1995 2 1 104 114 Jannosy G. et al. 2000 111 1198 208 Nicholsan J K. A. et al. 1994 177 43 54 .

Optionally to measure ALDH in a sample of peripheral lymphocytes purification of the sample for CD4 positive lymphocytes and or other target surface markers can be carried out using methods known in the art and ALDH contributed by CD4 positive lymphocytes can be measured for example.

In one embodiment peripheral lymphocytes are derived from a subject having an autoimmune disease. In another embodiment peripheral lymphocytes are derived from a subject having cancer. In yet other embodiments peripheral lymphocytes are derived from a subject having an allergic reaction or transplant rejection.

Preparation of cell samples enriched in peripheral lymphocytes can be obtained using known methods in the art including flow cytometry. The source of the cells may be the bone marrow fetal neonate or adult or other hematopoietic cell source e.g. fetal liver or blood. For example magnetic bead separations may be used initially to remove large numbers of lineage committed cells namely major cell populations of the hematopoietic systems including such lineages as T cells B cells both pre B and B cells myelomonocytic cells or minor cell populations such as megakaryocytes mast cells eosinophils and basophils.

In some embodiments ALDH is measured in a sample derived from a subject having cancer where the sample contains leukemia cells or other malignant cells.

In some embodiments of the methods of the present invention a sample including peripheral lymphocytes includes a banked blood sample from the patient.

In some embodiments a sample derived from a subject includes a substantially homogeneous population of peripheral lymphocytes. The term substantially homogeneous as used herein means that the sample derived from a subject being identified as being suitable or not suitable for high dose cyclophosphamide treatment includes more than about 1 or 2 or 5 or 10 of lineage committed cells. Hematopoietic stem cells can be isolated using any technique well known in the art or those described herein. For example peripheral lymphocytes can be characterized as having one or more of the following attributes for example expression of markers specific for committed lymphohematopoietic lineages such as CD19 CD33 and CD5 or being positive for expression of c kit and Thy.

Various methods known in the art and those described herein can be used for measuring ALDH in a cell sample including hematopoietic progenitor stem cells or peripheral lymphocytes. In some embodiments ALDH is measured using flow cytometry. In other embodiments ALDH is measured using western blot analysis.

In some embodiments ALDH activity is measured using a fluorescent substrate called dansyl aminoacetaldehyde or DAAA as a substrate. In another exemplary method ALDH activity is measured using BODIPY aminoacetaldehyde or BAAA as a substrate commercially available as ALDEFLUOR . In some embodiments of the various aspects of the present invention ALDH is measured by a contacting a sample including peripheral lymphocytes derived from a subject with DAAA and b measuring oxidation of DAAA. In some embodiments of the various aspects of the present invention ALDH is measured by a contacting a sample including hematopoietic progenitor stem cells derived from a subject with DAAA and b measuring oxidation of DAAA.

In some embodiments measurement of ALDH includes the steps of contacting a cell sample containing hematopoietic progenitor stem cells peripheral lymphocytes or granulocytes with a cell permeable non polar fluorescent aldehyde that is rendered polar by contact with ALDH for example by oxidation. Once rendered polar the fluorescent aldehyde is no longer permeable to the cell membrane and hence is trapped within only those cells in the cell mixture that express the intracellular marker. Cells containing the trapped polar non permeable fluorescent aldehyde so formed are identified by fluorescence using techniques and equipment well known to those of skill in the art. Exemplary fluorescence techniques include but are not limited to automated fluorescence cell sorting techniques that separate cells containing or having attached thereto a fluorescent marker such as Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting FACS . Such fluorescence cell sorting techniques are well known to those of skill in that art.

In some embodiments a fluorescent cell permeable aldehyde is a substrate for aldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH and is oxidized by contact with intracellular ALDH to a non permeable polar fluorescent molecule. When the fluorescent polar molecule is contacted by a light beam having the requisite wavelength to excite the molecule the fluorescent light emitted as the molecule drops back to its ground state is detected thereby indicating the presence of a cell or cell population containing intracellular ALDH. In some embodiments the fluorescent aldehyde is dansylaminoacetaldehyde DAAA a substrate for aldehyde dehydrogenase or analogs thereof. Dansyl fluorescence is excited at both 351.1 nm and 363.8 nm and is detected at about 521 nm. Description of the synthesis of DAAA can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 5 876 956 incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

A general method for producing a non polar fluorescent aldehyde for measuring ALDH is to react a physiologically compatible fluorescent molecule bearing an electrophilic group and a protected aldehyde such as a methyl or ethyl acetal having a nucleophilic group. For example the fluorescent electrophile may be a sulfonyl chloride such as dansyl chloride or Texas Red sulfonyl chloride an isothiocyanate such as fluorescein isothiocyantate an N hydroxysuccinimide such as N hydroxy succinimidorhodamine or a thiol reactive fluorescent derivative such as 5 iodoacetamidofluorescein. The protected aldehyde may contain one of a number of nucleophilic groups such as an amino hydroxyl phenolic or thiol group.

Without wishing to be bound by theory it is contemplated that any suitable characteristic associated with ALDH such as for example mRNA level polypeptide amount ALDH activity transcription rate translation rate etc. may be used as an indicator for identifying subjects that are suitable for high dose cyclophosphamide treatment. In some embodiments ALDH level for example amount of ALDH polypeptide present is used as an indicator for identifying subjects suitable for high dose cyclophosphamide treatment. In other embodiments ALDH activity is used as an indicator for identifying subjects suitable for high dose cyclophosphamide treatment.

In some embodiments ALDH levels or activity are measured in cancer cell populations e.g. breast cancer cells. In some embodiments ALDH levels or activity are measured in non cancer cell populations e.g. non breast cancer cells.

In some embodiments ALDH from peripheral lymphocytes determined to be CD4 positive e.g. by purification or separation is measured.

It also has been observed that in patients receiving oxazaphosphorine therapy for autoimmune diseases patients who achieved maximal immunosuppression following the therapy as indicated by their white blood cell WBC count reaching 0 zero per microliter or per cubic millimeter mm experience a better clinical outcome and lessened risk of disease relapse than patients whose WBC count did not reach zero following therapy. Analysis of the banked blood of a series of patients following high dose cyclophosphamide treatment demonstrated that patients who reached a white blood cell count of 0 and subsequently enjoyed a better clinical outcome had a much lower level of ALDH activity than the patient who relapsed without reaching a WBC of 0.

Accordingly it may be beneficial to monitor the WBC count of patients before during and or after oxazaphosphorine treatment and if the number WBC are consistent with incomplete immunosuppression retreating the subject with oxazaphosphorine. Thus another aspect of the invention is a method for identifying a subject suitable for oxazaphosphorine retreatment comprising determining the number of WBC in a blood sample derived from the subject wherein the subject is identified as being suitable for oxazaphosphorine retreatment if the number of WBC is consistent with incomplete immunosuppression. WBC numbers themselves can be used as an indicator or WBC numbers can be used in conjunction with ALDH measurement to determine a patient s suitability for oxazaphosphorine treatment or re retreatment.

In some embodiments incomplete immunosuppression is indicated by the existence of a WBC count of greater than zero. In some embodiments incomplete immunosuppression is indicated by the existence of a WBC count of greater than 4. In some embodiments incomplete immunosuppression is indicated by the existence of a WBC count of greater than 10. In some embodiments incomplete immunosuppression is indicated by the existence of a WBC count of greater than 12. In some embodiments incomplete immunosuppression is indicated by the existence of a WBC count of greater than 15. In some embodiments incomplete immunosuppression is indicated by the existence of a WBC count of greater than 20.

Various methods that are known in the art may be utilized in determining the number of WBC in a sample such as flow cytometry including fluorescence activated cell sorting FACS . Automated blood counting can be utilized using automated hematology analyzers for example. Typically blood counting machines aspirate a very small amount of the blood specimen through narrow tubing. Within the tubing are sensors that count the number of cells passing through it and can identify the cell flow cytometry . Automated blood counting machines that may be utilized include for example BECKMAN COULTER LH series SYSMEX XE 2100 SIEMENS ADVIA 120 and 2120 and the ABBOTT CELL DYN series.

Typically methods for estimating WBC in biological fluids are based on automated cell counting technologies in which the sample is diluted and cells of different sizes and shapes are counted in a flow cell. See for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 2 656 508 3 502 973 and 6 159 740. In addition U.S. Pat. No. 6 709 868 describes a method for measuring WBC count by capturing white blood cells from the fluid sample by a retainer removing red blood cells and other interfering substances by a wash solution and reading the result of a color reaction in which an ester which is present on the white blood cells cleaves a chromogenic substrate which produces a water insoluble dye. The apparatus for use in the method of U.S. Pat. No. 6 709 868 includes a retainer for white blood cells that has a dye substrate immobilized therein and an absorption layer that wicks and takes up all excess washing solution flowing past the sample. In addition to flow based assays any of various non flow cytometric technologies may be utilized such as manual assays using optical or fluorescence microscopes e.g. Dynal immune bead based assay Coulter immune head based assay etc. Pattanapanysat K et al. 2005 65 1 29 36 Pattanapanysat K. and Thakar M. R. 2005 121 4 539 549 Paxton H. et al. 1995 2 1 104 114 Jannosy G. et al. 2000 111 1198 208 Nicholsan J K. A. et al. 1994 177 43 54 . Though less efficient and subject to human error the WBC count can be carried out manually. For example a blood film or peripheral blood smear can be made which is a slide made from a drop of blood that allows the cells to be examined microscopically.

Optionally additional diagnostic tests can be carried out on the blood samples. For example the WBC count can be determined as part of the complete blood count CBC .

In some embodiments the blood sample is selected from among peripheral blood bone marrow aspirate and apheresis. In some embodiments the blood sample comprises a sample of banked blood.

Optionally the blood sample can be pre treated such as with an anti coagulant or other agent prior to determining the number of WBC e.g. with heparin ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid EDTA citrate or double oxalate or separated or purified.

In some embodiments the method further comprises re administering oxazaphosphorine to the subject one or more times if the WBC number is consistent with incomplete immunosuppression e.g. if the number of WBC are greater than zero per microliter of sample . In some embodiments the method further comprises ceasing high dose oxazaphosphorine re treatment once the number of WBC in a sample obtained from the patient are no longer consistent with incomplete immunosuppression e.g. the patient reaches maximal immunosuppression as indicated by a WBC count of zero per microliter of sample .

In some embodiments the methods of the present invention include determining the number of WBC in a plurality of blood samples derived from the subject over time and further includes administering oxazaphosphorine to the subject one or more times until the number of WBC are no longer consistent with incomplete immunosuppression.

In some embodiments retreatment alleviates or eliminates one or more symptoms associated with the immune disorder. In some embodiments the immune disorder is multiple sclerosis such as relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis or another autoimmune disorder and wherein the retreatment results in partial or full restoration of function which can be determined for example by multiple sclerosis functional composite MSFC score or Kurtzke expanded disability status scale EDSS .

In some embodiments the subject has previously undergone oxazaphosphorine administration and the blood sample is derived from the subject at a time point after the previous oxazaphosphorine administration. For example blood samples may be obtained from the subject and WBC number determined on a daily basis or semi daily basis for a number of days or weeks following oxazaphosphorine treatment. In some embodiments the one or more time points at which a blood sample is obtained from the subject and WBC number determined are within about two weeks of initiating oxazaphosphorine administration. Oxazaphosphorine can be re administered to the subject one or more times if the number of WBC is consistent with incomplete immunosuppression e.g. greater than zero WBC per microliter of blood sample .

In some embodiments the dosage of oxazaphosphorine drug administered before and or after incomplete immunosuppression is determined is 50 mg kg day. In some embodiments the oxazaphosphorine drug is administered to the subject for 4 days after incomplete immunosuppression is determined. In some embodiments the amount of oxazaphosphorine drug administered is 200 mg kg administered over 4 consecutive days. In some embodiments the amount of oxazaphosphorine drug administered before and or after incomplete immunosuppression is determined is 50 mg kg day administered for 4 days.

In some embodiments the oxazaphosphorine drug is selected from the group consisting of cyclophosphamide ifosfamide perfosfamide trophosphamide and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt solvate prodrug or metabolite thereof. In some embodiments the oxazaphosphorine drug is cyclophosphamide or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or metabolite thereof. In some embodiments the oxazaphosphorine drug comprises cyclophosphamide. In some embodiments the oxazaphosphorine drug is cyclophosphamide administered in the amount of 50 mg kg for 4 days before determining the WBC count and or after incomplete immunosuppression is determined.

In some embodiments the method further comprises measuring ALDH in a sample including hematopoietic progenitor stem cells derived from the subject wherein the subject is identified as being suitable for oxazaphosphorine treatment if a the ALDH is consistent with a resistant ALDH in hematopoietic progenitor stem cells and b the number of WBC is consistent with incomplete immunosuppression. In other embodiments the method further comprises measuring ALDH in a sample including peripheral lymphocytes derived from the subject wherein the subject is identified as being suitable for high dose oxazaphosphorine treatment if a the ALDH is consistent with a sensitive ALDH in peripheral lymphocytes and b the number of WBC is consistent with incomplete immunosuppression. The blood sample in which WBC number is determined and the sample in which ALDH is measured can be the same sample or different samples. Various methods known in the art and those described herein can be used for measuring ALDH in a cell sample including hematopoietic progenitor stem cells or peripheral lymphocytes.

In some aspects the present invention is directed to methods for selecting a subject suitable for oxazaphosphorine therapy. In some embodiments the methods include determining whether treatment with an oxazaphosphorine can be safe and effective for the subject based on one or more safety or efficacy factors and selecting a subject suitable for oxazaphosphorine therapy where it is determined that treatment can be safe and effective.

In some embodiments the safety or efficacy factors include an ALDH inhibition factor. ALDH inhibition factors include but are not limited to hormonal contraceptive use e.g. estrogen and or progestin via oral administration patch or injection tobacco use and chronic alcohol use. ALDH inhibition factors also include but are not limited to the use of ALDH inhibiting agents and or ALDH activating agent.

The ALDH inhibiting agent can be any of the ALDH inhibiting agents listed herein including but not limited to disulfiram calcium carbimide diazepam chlordiazepoxide isosorbide dinitrate nitroglycerine chlorpropamide tolazamide and cephalosporin. The ALDH activating agent can be any of the ALDH activating agents listed herein including calcium ions.

In some embodiments the method further includes periodically determining whether treatment with an oxazaphosphorine continues to be safe and effective for the subject based on one or more safety or efficacy factors. In some embodiments the method further includes monitoring white blood cell count before treatment during treatment after treatment or a combination of two or more of the foregoing.

In some aspects the present invention provides methods for delivering an oxazaphosphorine to subjects in need thereof while restricting access to the oxazaphosphorine by subjects for whom the drug may be contraindicated. In some embodiments the methods include obtaining subject information relating to the existence of one or more contraindication factors and permitting delivery of the oxazaphosphorine only after it has been determined that the subject can safely be treated based on the information relating to one or more contraindication factors.

In some embodiments the contraindication factors include one or more ALDH inhibition factors. ALDH inhibition factors include but are not limited to hormonal contraceptive use e.g. estrogen and or progestin via oral administration patch or injection tobacco use and chronic alcohol use. ALDH inhibition factors also include but are not limited to the use of ALDH inhibiting agents and or ALDH activating agent.

In some embodiments permitting delivery includes generating a prescription approval code to be retrieved by a pharmacy before a prescription is filled. In some embodiments permitting delivery includes allowing the shipment of a dosage to a pharmacy. In some embodiments permitting delivery includes allowing a patient to be treated with the oxazaphosphorine drug in a prepackaged dosage.

In some embodiments the methods further include counseling the patient as to risk avoidance measures in response to the information relating to the existence of one or more contraindication factors.

Subsequent to measuring ALDH in a sample containing hematopoietic progenitor stem cells and or peripheral lymphocytes derived from a subject the subject is identified as being suitable or not being suitable for oxazaphosphorine treatment e.g. high dose cyclophosphamide treatment by for example comparing the ALDH to a predetermined value.

In some embodiments a predetermined value is a resistant ALDH as described herein. Accordingly in some embodiments a subject is identified as being suitable for high dose oxazaphosphorine treatment e.g. high dose cyclophosphamide treatment if the ALDH e.g. level or activity of ALDH in a sample including hematopoietic progenitor stem cells derived from the subject is consistent with a resistant ALDH. A resistant ALDH is an ALDH e.g. level or activity of ALDH which is sufficient to confer resistance of a hematopoietic progenitor stem cell to high dose oxazaphosphorine e.g. high dose cyclophosphamide . In other words a resistant ALDH is that level or activity of ALDH in a hematopoietic progenitor stem cell or a sample containing hematopoietic progenitor stem cells at which the cell or cells survive exposure to oxazaphosphorine e.g. high dose cyclophosphamide . In other embodiments a subject is identified as not being suitable for high dose oxazaphosphorine treatment if the ALDH e.g. level or activity is not consistent with a resistant ALDH or if it is consistent with a sensitive ALDH for the stem cells.

It is understood that a resistant ALDH can be a single value or a range of ALDH which is sufficient for conferring resistance to oxazaphosphorine e.g. high dose cyclophosphamide . For example in one embodiment a resistant ALDH is a level of ALDH protein in a sample containing hematopoietic progenitor stem cells which survive exposure to one or more doses of oxazaphosphorine. In another embodiment a resistant ALDH is an activity of ALDH in a sample containing hematopoietic progenitor stem cells which survive exposure to one or more doses of high dose oxazaphosphorine.

It is understood that a resistant ALDH may either be a value known to one of ordinary skill in the art or it may be determined prior to measuring ALDH in a sample derived from a subject being identified as being suitable or not suitable for high dose oxazaphosphorine treatment e.g. high dose cyclophosphamide treatment .

For example in some embodiments a predetermined or resistant ALDH is at least 10 to about 30 nanomoles aldehyde oxidized mg protein min. Accordingly in some embodiments a subject having ALDH at least 10 to about 30 nanomoles aldehyde oxidized mg protein min or higher is identified as being suitable for high dose oxazaphosphorine treatment.

In some embodiments a predetermined ALDH is determined for example by expressing varying amounts of ALDH in cells for example in cell culture and exposing them to one or more doses of high dose oxazaphosphorine treatment e.g. high dose cyclophosphamide . Accordingly a resistant ALDH is the amount or activity of ALDH at which the cells are resistant to high dose oxazaphosphorine treatment e.g. high dose cyclophosphamide . ALDH in a sample derived from a subject being identified using the methods of the invention can subsequently be compared with the resistant ALDH to determine whether the subject is suitable or not suitable for high dose oxazaphosphorine treatment e.g. high dose cyclophosphamide treatment .

In some embodiments according to the present invention a subject is identified as being suitable or not being suitable for high dose oxazaphosphorine treatment e.g. high dose cyclophosphamide treatment based on the ALDH relative to an appropriate control.

For example in some embodiments a subject is identified as being suitable for high dose oxazaphosphorine treatment e.g. high dose cyclophosphamide treatment if a sample containing hematopoietic progenitor stem cells derived from the subject includes an ALDH e.g. level or activity which is consistent with appropriate control i.e. equal or higher than the control in case of a single cut off value or falling within the appropriate range . Conversely a subject is identified as not being suitable for high dose oxazaphosphorine treatment if the ALDH e.g. level or activity in a sample containing hematopoietic progenitor stem cells derived from the subject is not consistent with an appropriate control i.e. lower than the control in case of a single cut off value or not falling within the appropriate range .

It is understood that an appropriate control could be a single value or a range of ALDH which is known to confer resistance to high dose oxazaphosphorine treatment e.g. high dose cyclophosphamide treatment . An appropriate control known in the art may be used in the methods of the invention or it may be determined using one or more methods described herein and those that are known in the art.

For example in one embodiment an appropriate control is determined based on the response of a population of subjects to high dose cyclophosphamide. In some embodiments a number of samples containing hematopoietic progenitor stem cells are derived from a population of subjects for example at least 10 or at least 15 or at least 20 or at least 30 or at least 40 or at least 50 or at least 100 or more . Accordingly ALDH e.g. level or activity can be measured in various samples prior to treatment with high dose cyclophosphamide. An appropriate control can subsequently be determined as that ALDH e.g. level or activity sufficient for conferring resistance to high dose cyclophosphamide. In other words an appropriate control can be a single value e.g. mean or median of ALDH level or activity or a range of ALDH level or activity in the samples at which the hematopoietic progenitor stem cells survive exposure to high dose oxazaphosphorine i.e. resistant ALDH . Accordingly a subject is subsequently identified as being suitable for high dose oxazaphosphorine treatment e.g. high dose cyclophosphamide treatment if a sample containing hematopoietic progenitor stem cells derived from the subject includes an ALDH e.g. level or activity which is consistent with i.e. at least equal to or higher than the appropriate control. Conversely the subject is identified as not being suitable for high dose oxazaphosphorine treatment e.g. high dose cyclophosphamide treatment if the ALDH e.g. level or activity is lower than the appropriate control.

In some embodiments the methods include measuring ALDH in a sample including hematopoietic progenitor stem cells derived from the subject where the subject is identified as being suitable for high dose oxazaphosphorine treatment if the ALDH is consistent with a resistant ALDH standard in hematopoietic progenitor stem cells. Conversely a subject is identified as not being suitable for high dose oxazaphosphorine treatment if the ALDH is not consistent with a resistant standard or is consistent with a sensitive ALDH standard in hematopoietic progenitor stem cells.

In some embodiments the methods include measuring ALDH in a sample including peripheral lymphocytes derived from the subject where the subject is identified as being suitable for high dose oxazaphosphorine treatment if the ALDH is consistent with a sensitive ALDH standard in peripheral lymphocytes. Conversely a subject is identified as not being suitable for high dose oxazaphosphorine treatment if the ALDH is not consistent with a sensitive or is consistent with a resistant ALDH standard in peripheral lymphocytes.

In some embodiments the methods include measuring ALDH in a sample including peripheral lymphocytes derived from the subject where the subject is identified as being suitable for high dose oxazaphosphorine treatment if the ALDH is consistent with an ALDH standard demonstrated to allow maximal immunosuppression in the subject following administration of high dose oxazaphosphorine.

In some embodiments the methods include measuring ALDH in a sample including hematopoietic progenitor stem cells derived from a subject where the subject is identified as being suitable for high dose oxazaphosphorine treatment if the measured ALDH is consistent with an appropriate standard of ALDH. Conversely a subject is identified as not being suitable for high dose oxazaphosphorine treatment if ALDH is not consistent with an appropriate standard.

In some embodiments the methods include measuring ALDH in a sample including peripheral lymphocytes derived from a subject where the subject is identified as being suitable for high dose oxazaphosphorine treatment if ALDH is consistent with an appropriate standard. Conversely a subject is identified as not being suitable for high dose oxazaphosphorine treatment if ALDH is not consistent with an appropriate standard.

Additional methods for identifying a subject suitable for high dose can be found for example in WO 2008 034071 the contents of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by this reference.

Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory it is believed that administration of oxazaphosphorine e.g. high dose cyclophosphamide is contra indicated in patients who have successfully achieved a durable remission in tumors following vaccination with an autologous anti tumor anti idiotype vaccine. Thus patients who achieve a lasting remission with an autologous anti tumor anti idiotype vaccine e.g. BIOVAXID and or BIOVAXID boosters may be placed in jeopardy of a tumor relapse if the immunity due to the vaccine is either permanently or temporarily disrupted or modified e.g. following a course of oxazaphosphorine e.g. high dose cyclophosphamide therapy.

Accordingly in some aspects the present invention provides a method for determining whether a subject is suitable for high dose oxazaphosphorine therapy. In some embodiments the method includes determining whether the subject has undergone treatment with an autologous anti idiotype vaccine and selecting a subject as non suitable for high dose oxazaphosphorine therapy where it is determined that the subject has undergone treatment for a B cell malignancy with the autologous anti idiotype vaccine and has achieved complete remission following vaccination. In some embodiments the autologous anti idiotype vaccine is the BIOVAXID vaccine. BIOVAXID is a patient specific follicular lymphoma FL vaccine derived from an individual subject s cancerous cells.

In some aspects the present invention provides a system for ensuring the safety or efficacy of a treatment that includes oxazaphosphorine administration. In some embodiments the system includes selecting a set of safety and efficacy factors associated with the safe and effective treatment of a subject with an oxazaphosphorine drug defining a set of information to be obtained from a subject including information probative of the set of selected safety and efficacy factors associated with the safe and effective treatment of a subject with an oxazaphosphorine drug determining whether treatment that includes an oxazaphosphorine administration can be safe and effective for the subject based on the set of information and generating a prescription approval code if it is determined that the treatment including the oxazaphosphorine administration can be safe and effective.

In some embodiments the safety or efficacy factors include an ALDH inhibition factor. ALDH inhibition factors include but are not limited to hormonal contraceptive use e.g. estrogen and or progestin via oral administration patch or injection tobacco use and chronic alcohol use. ALDH inhibition factors also include but are not limited to the use of ALDH inhibiting agents and or ALDH activating agent.

The ALDH inhibiting agent can be any of the ALDH inhibiting agents listed herein including but not limited to disulfiram calcium carbimide diazepam chlordiazepoxide isosorbide dinitrate nitroglycerine chlorpropamide tolazamide and cephalosporin. The ALDH activating agent can be any of the ALDH activating agents listed herein including calcium ions.

In some embodiments the safety or efficacy factors include an ALDH level consistent with a resistant ALDH level in hematopoietic progenitor stem cells. In some embodiments the safety or efficacy factors include an ALDH level consistent with a resistant ALDH level in peripheral lymphocytes.

In some embodiments the method further includes periodically determining whether treatment with an oxazaphosphorine continues to be safe and effective for the subject based on one or more safety or efficacy factors. In some embodiments the method further includes monitoring white blood cell count before treatment during treatment after treatment or a combination of two or more of the foregoing.

In some embodiments a subject will be screened for pregnancy and to ensure they match all necessary inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria. If a subject meets all necessary inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria and is not pregnant they will be enrolled in the program e.g. through registration software to verify their eligibility and ensure each subject s cyclophosphamide dose for infusion is appropriately assigned and validated.

In some embodiments a female of childbearing potential will commit to use two forms of effective contraception simultaneously for one month before during and for one month after therapy. Similarly male subjects will commit to use latex condoms every time they engage in heterosexual sexual intercourse. In some embodiments a female of childbearing potential will have at least two negative urine or blood serum pregnancy tests before commencement of therapy. In some embodiments the patient will be re tested each month during therapy and receive a negative result prior to receiving each dosage. In some embodiments failure to receive a negative result on a pregnancy test will constitute grounds for suspension of therapy.

Inclusion criteria may include but are not limited to age criterion and active disease requirements e.g. subjects with one or more disease indications or relapses within the prior twelve months . Exclusion criteria may include but are not limited to any risk of pregnancy a history of hormonal contraceptives or disulfiram exposure e.g. exposure to hormonal contraceptives or disulfiram for the 120 days prior to commencement of therapy a cardiac ejection fraction of less than 45 a serum creatinine level of greater than 2.0 any indication of patient being pre terminal or moribund bilirubin levels of greater than 2.0 transaminase levels greater than twice the normal level presence of items which would hinder monitoring of disease disorder progression e.g. pacemakers and implants which would inhibit the use of MRIs WBC count less than 3000 cells l platelet count of less than 100 000 cells l untransfused active infections other serious medical illness. In some embodiments failure to meet all of the inclusions and or meeting any of the exclusion criteria will constitute grounds for suspension of therapy.

In some embodiments the system provides a validation system to ensure patients receiving therapy do not concurrently receive medications with known interactions with cyclophosphamide. Medications with known severe interactions with cyclophosphamide include but are not limited to cyclosporine etanercept allopurinol live bacillus of calmette and guerin vaccine tamoxifen smallpox vaccine live rubella virus vaccine live mumps virus vaccine live poliovirus vaccine live measles virus vaccine varicella virus vaccine yellow fever vaccine pentostatin typhoid vaccine St. John s wort trastuzumab and live rotavirus vaccine. Medications with known moderate interactions with cyclophosphamide include but are not limited to chloramphenicol ondansetron nevirapine succinylcholine digoxin hydrochlorothiazide and indomethacin.

Optionally the methods and systems of the invention further comprise virological monitoring including assaying a sample obtained from the subject e.g. blood urine saliva bronchioalveolar lavage specimens plasma other bodily fluids breath or tissues for the presence of viruses such as herpesvirus HSV before administration of the oxazaphosphorine e.g. high dose or low dose . In one embodiment low dose oxazaphosphorine e.g. low dose cyclophosphamide is administered for treatment of cancer. Examples of herpesviruses include but are not limited to herpes simplex virus 1 HSV 1 herpes simplex virus 2 HSV 2 varicella zoster virus VZV Epstein Barr virus EBV cytomegalovirus CMV herpesvirus 6 HHV 6 herpesvirus 7 HHV 7 and herpesvirus 8 HHV 8 also known as Kaposi s sarcoma associated herpesvirus KSHV . Other examples of viruses of concern include respiratory viruses e.g. adenovirus influenza respiratory syncytial virus RSV papovavirus e.g. papilloma polyomavirus such as BKV and JCV measles hepatitis A HAV hepatitis B HBV hepatitis C HCV enterovirus parvovirus rabies virus Rubella virus Coxsackievirus and human lymphotrophic virus.

Assaying for the presence of viruses e.g. monitoring viral titers can be done before during or after ALDH level is determined. In subjects determined to have low ALDH levels in the peripheral lymphocytes and thus more susceptible to infection a suitable antiviral agent can be administered in a timely fashion. Preferably a sample is obtained at one or more time points following administration of the oxazaphosphorine and assayed for viruses as well. Laboratory techniques that may be utilized for detection and quantification of virus include for example virus culture viral serology viral DNA detection by polymerase chain reaction PCR and viral RNA detection by reverse transcription PCR. Preferably assays are quantitative or semi quantitative. PCR and RT PCR detection methods are preferred as they generally offer the advantages of rapid turn around time high sensitivity and high specificity.

In some embodiments when all criteria are met software generates an approval code preferably with an expiration date that is transmitted to the filling facility or conveyed to the drug provider to communicate that the patient is approved for drug administration e.g. drug infusion . The terms approval code approval status code prescription approval code authorization code and prescription authorization code are used herein interchangeably and can comprise for example a label signal tone bar code number series of numbers color series of colors letter series of letters symbol series of symbols hologram s a combination of two or more of the foregoing or other form of communication. The approval code may be readable to humans computer readable or both. In some embodiments the approval code includes an indication of the oxazaphoshorine e.g. cyclophosphamide dose to be administered e.g. infused . The approval code may be transmitted or conveyed to the filling facility or the drug provider by any method such as telephone facsimile interne postal mail etc. In some embodiments the approval code includes the patient s unique identifier. In some embodiments the approval code is affixed to or otherwise associated with a container which includes the oxazaphosphorine e.g. cyclophosphamide . In some embodiments the container includes the oxazaphosphorine dosage. The oxazaphosphorine is then administered to the subject whose identity is associated with the approval code. The container to which the approval code is affixed or otherwise associated may be for example a flexible container such as an infusion bag or a rigid container such as that which may be used for lyophilized drugs. Lyophilized drugs may be reconstituted at an infusion facility for administration to the patient. Drug containers may be delivered or shipped to the filling facility or drug provider by any method such as mail or courier. In those embodiments in which the approval code is affixed to the drug container s the approval code may be directly or indirectly affixed to the drug container s . For example in some embodiments the approval code is affixed to or otherwise associated with a packaging that contains one or more containers containing oxazaphosphorine for the particular patient.

In some embodiments once the oxazaphosphorine container is received at the administration facility e.g. an infusion facility the patient s unique identifier is verified against the central database for a final status check. In some embodiments when an approval code is found to be valid the drug administration to the patient may proceed as described previously. In some embodiments treatment related adverse events are entered into the database.

In some embodiments any one of the methods or systems described herein is computer implemented. In some embodiments the present invention also provides a computer readable storage medium holding computer executable instructions for carrying out any of the methods or systems described herein.

In a further aspect the invention includes any combination of the following steps after administration of the first dose of the oxazaphosphorine drug 

It is to be understood that the steps need not be performed in the exact order listed herein. Additionally one or more of the steps may be performed more than once e.g. two three four or more times. Moreover when a step is repeated different variables may be used. For example the methods of the present invention may include step o 2 and step o 7 which may occur simultaneously consecutively or with one or more other steps in between.

By way of example the method for providing a system of care for an oxazaphosphorine drug regimen may include the following aforementioned steps step a or steps a and b or steps a b and c or steps a b c and d or steps a b c d e f and g or steps a b c d e f g and h or steps a b c d e f g h and i or steps a b c d e f g h i and j or steps a b c d e f g h i j and k or steps a b c d e f g h i j k and l or steps a b c d e f g h i j k l and m or steps a b c d e f g h i j k l m and n or steps a b c d e f g h i k l m n and o and so forth.

In an alternative embodiment from the steps shown in the patient is authorized for oxazaphosphorine therapy by 1 validating the patient for the pre treatment testing 2 computing an approval code and or registering an approval code in the central database 3 shipping the oxazaphosphorine drug to the physician or infusion facility and 4 having the infusion facility or physician s office check with the database provider for the patient s status. Thus the difference is in the authorization step where instead of the container e.g. bag or other container being shipped on a per patient basis the drug is shipped as a generic container and then labeled with the patient s ID at the administration facility by the administering physician staff member.

In some embodiments of the methods and systems of the invention one or more radiological assessments e.g. brain and or spinal cord imaging and or functional or quality of life assessments are conducted on the patient. In some embodiments the patient is suffering from a neurological autoimmune disorder suspected of having a neurological autoimmune disorder or at risk of developing a neurological autoimmune disorder and it is to be determined whether treatment that includes oxazaphosphorine administration can be safe and effective for the patient based at least in part on the radiological assessment and or functional assessment.

Nine patients were treated 50 mg kg day cyclophosphamide intravenously for four days on Day 3 to Day 0 . All 9 patients had aggressive relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis 8 of whom failed conventional therapy and 1 was untreated. Median age at time of entry was 29 years range of 20 to 47 years . The mean number of gadolinium enhancing lesions on baseline MRI was 6.5 range 3 11 . There was a 90 reduction in gadolinium enhancements at 6 months and subsequently a 94 reduction by 18 months following high dose cyclophosphamide treatment. Only one patient had an exacerbation during follow up and was started on conventional MS therapy at 18 months. At baseline 66 of patients had a disability score of 5.0 or more on the Expanded Disability Status Scale EDSS . A 50 reduction in disability was observed with 3 patients having no disability EDSS score of 0 and 1 patient with EDSS score of 1. This response rate reduction of disability is unprecedented. Similar results have been independently confirmed however those patients were more advanced in their disease and the absolute reduction in disability was less Gladstone D E et al. 2006 63 10 1388 1393 .

In the pilot study with an initial cohort of 9 patients with severe relapsing MS there have been no significant adverse outcomes. It appears that the dose of cyclophosphamide has variable effects in individual subjects in terms of the ability of high dose cyclophosphamide treatment to reduce the patient s white blood cell WBC count to 0. This appeared to affect the long term outcome with respect to the potential for disease reactivation as measured by the recurrence of gadolinium enhancing lesions .

On Day 6 six days after completion of high dose cyclophosphamide treatment patients received G CSF. is a table showing ALDH levels and WBC levels in the 9 human patients with aggressive relapsing remitting MS that received 50 mg kg day cyclophosphamide intravenously on Day 3 to Day 0.

The two patients whose WBC count went to 0 within two weeks of high dose cyclophosphamide treatment HiCy05 and HiCy13 had no gadolinium enhancing lesions GEL up to 24 months follow up FUGEL . Two additional patients HiCy09 and HiCy15 had 0 GEL and both had a minimum WBC count of 12. Patients who always had GEL on every follow up HiCy11 and HiCy19 never went to a 0 WBC count minimum WBC counts were 24 and 50 respectively . However. HiCy19 had only completed 6 months of follow up. Patients HiCy07 and HiCy14 who went to 0 GEL but on follow up magnetic resonance imagings MRIs had a single GEL had variable minimum WBC 6 and 31 . HiCy01 whose minimum WBC was 70 and never had GEL did not have any GEL at subsequent follow up visits. This patient had been hospitalized several times with new acute worsening of his neurologic status that was highly suspicious of exacerbations even prompting rituxan treatment despite no GEL.

As shown in the table of Spearman s correlation coefficient of geometric ALDH levels and the 6 day average minimal WBC level was 0.800 with a p value of 0.010 highly statistically significant . This represents the average ALDH activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC from the 9 patients in the study which was ascertained using ALDEFLUOR and fluorescence activated cell sorting FACS to identify the contribution of only CD4 positive cells. CD8 positive T cells showed no correlation in ALDH levels and mean minimal WBC count.
