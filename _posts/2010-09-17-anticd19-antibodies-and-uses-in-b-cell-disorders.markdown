This invention was made in part with government support under grant numbers CA1776 CA105001 and CA96547 awarded by the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health and under grant number AI56363 awarded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease of the National Institutes of Health.

The present invention is directed to methods for the treatment and or prevention of diseases and disorders using therapeutic antibodies that bind to the human CD19 antigen. Diseases and disorders include B cell disorders or diseases in human subjects including B cell malignancies and autoimmune conditions. The present invention is also directed to methods for treatment and prevention of graft versus host disease GVHD humoral rejection and post transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder in human transplant recipients. In a preferred embodiment the therapeutic anti CD19 antibodies of the compositions and methods of the invention mediate human antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ADCC . The present invention is further directed to compositions comprising human humanized or chimeric anti CD19 antibodies of the IgG1 and or IgG3 human isotype. The present invention is further directed to compositions comprising human humanized or chimeric anti CD19 antibodies of the IgG2 and or IgG4 human isotype that preferably mediate human ADCC. The present invention also encompasses monoclonal human humanized or chimeric anti CD19 antibodies.

B cell surface markers have been generally suggested as targets for the treatment of B cell disorders or diseases autoimmune disease and transplantation rejection. Examples of B cell surface markers include CD10 CD19 CD20 CD21 CD22 CD23 CD24 CD37 CD53 CD72 CD74 CD75 CD77 CD79a CD79b CD80 CD81 CD82 CD83 CD84 CD85 and CD86 leukocyte surface markers. Antibodies that specifically bind these markers have been developed and some have been tested for the treatment of diseases and disorders.

For example chimeric or radiolabeled monoclonal antibody mAb based therapies directed against the CD20 cell surface molecule specific for mature B cells and their malignant counterparts have been shown to be an effective in vivo treatment for non Hodgkin s lymphoma Tedder et al. 15 450 454 1994 Press et al. 221 240 2001 Kaminski et al. 329 459 465 1993 Weiner 26 43 51 1999 Onrust et al. 58 79 88 1999 McLaughlin et al. 12 1763 1769 1998 Reff et al. 83 435 445 1994 Maloney et al. 90 2188 2195 1997 Maloney et al. 15 3266 3274 1997 Anderson et al. 25 705 708 1997 . Anti CD20 monoclonal antibody therapy has also been found to ameliorate the manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus erythematosus idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and hemolytic anemia as well as other immune mediated diseases Silverman et al. 48 1484 1492 2002 Edwards et al. 40 1 7 2001 De Vita et al. 46 2029 2033 2002 Leandro et al. 61 883 888 2002 Leandro et al. 46 2673 2677 2001 . The anti CD22 monoclonal antibody LL 2 was shown to be effective in treating aggressive and relapsed lymphoma patients undergoing chemotherapeutic treatment Goldenberg U.S. Pat. Nos 6 134 982 and 6 306 393 . The anti CD20 IgG1 antibody RITUXAN has successfully been used in the treatment of certain diseases such as adult immune thrombocytopenic purpura rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune hemolytic anemia Cured et al. WO 00 67796 . Despite the effectiveness of this therapy most acute lymphoblastic leukemias ALL and many other B cell malignancies either do not express CD20 express CD20 at low levels or have lost CD20 expression following CD20 immunotherapy Smith et al. 22 7359 7368 2003 . Moreover the expression of CD20 is not predictive of response to anti CD20 therapy as only half of non Hodgkin s lymphoma patients respond to CD20 directed immunotherapy.

The human CD19 molecule is a structurally distinct cell surface receptor that is expressed on the surface of human B cells including but not limited to pre B cells B cells in early development i.e. immature B cells mature B cells through terminal differentiation into plasma cells and malignant B cells. Unlike CD20 the CD19 antigen was thought to be expressed at higher levels and internalized by cells when bound by an anti CD19 antibody. The CD19 antigen has been one of the many proposed targets for immunotherapy. However the perceived unavailability as a target due to cellular internalization was thought to have presented obstacles to the development of therapeutic protocols that could be successfully used in human subjects.

CD19 is expressed by most pre B acute lymphoblastic leukemias ALL non Hodgkin s lymphomas B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias CLL pro lymphocytic leukemias hairy cell leukemias common acute lymphocytic leukemias and some Null acute lymphoblastic leukemias Nadler et al. 131 244 250 1983 Loken et al. 70 1316 1324 1987 Uckun et al. 71 13 29 1988 Anderson et al. 198463 1424 1433 1984 Scheuermann 18 385 397 1995 . The expression of CD19 on plasma cells further suggests it may be expressed on differentiated B cell tumors such as multiple myeloma plasmacytomas Waldenstrom s tumors Grossbard et al. 102 509 15 1998 Treon et al. 30 248 52 2003 . The CLB CD19 antibody anti CD19 murine IgG2a mAb was shown to inhibit growth of human tumors implanted in athymic mice Hooijberg et al. 55 840 846 1995 . In another study the monoclonal murine antibody FMC63 IgG2a was chimerized using a human IgG1 Fc region. Administration of this chimeric antibody to SCID mice bearing a human B cell lymphoma xenotransplantation model did not induce complement mediated cytotoxicity or ADCC but resulted in significant killing of the transplanted tumor cells Geoffrey et al. 41 53 60 1995 In addition to favorable internalization and greater efficiency in depleting B cells anti CD19 antibody therapy was not recognized for the depletion of serum immunoglobulin levels.

The results obtained using xenotransplantation mouse models of tumor implantation led to studies using murine anti CD19 antibodies in human patients. The murine CLB CD19 antibody was administered to six patients diagnosed with a progressive non Hodgkin s lymphoma who had failed previous conventional therapy chemotherapy or radiotherapy . These patients were given total antibody doses ranging from 225 to 1 000 mg Hekman et al. 32 364 372 1991 . Although circulating tumor cells were temporarily reduced in two patients after antibody infusion only one patient achieved partial remission after two periods of antibody treatment. No conclusions regarding therapeutic efficacy could be drawn from this small group of refractory patients.

Subsequently these investigators showed that the anti tumor effects of unconjugated CD20 mAbs are far superior to those of CD19 mAbs in transplantation models Hooijberg et al. 55 840 846 1995 and Hooijberg et al. 55 2627 2634 1995 . Moreover they did not observe additive or synergistic effects on tumor incidence when using CD19 and CD20 mAbs in combination Hooijberg et al. 55 840 846 1995 . Although the xenotransplantation animal models were recognized to be poor prognostic indicators for efficacy in human subjects the negative results achieved in these animal studies discouraged interest in therapy with naked anti CD19 antibodies.

The use of anti CD19 antibody based immunotoxins produced equally discouraging results. In early clinical trials the B4 anti CD19 antibody murine IgG1 mAb was conjugated to the plant toxin ricin and administered to human patients having multiple myeloma who had failed previous conventional therapy Grossbard et al. 102 509 515 1998 advanced non Hodgkin s lymphoma Grossbard et al. 5 2392 2398 1999 and refractory B cell malignancies Grossbard et al. 79 576 585 1992 . These trials generally demonstrated the safety of administering the B4 ricin conjugate to humans however results were mixed and response rates were discouraging in comparison to clinical trials with RITUXAN Grossbard et al. 5 2392 2398 1999 . In addition a significant portion of the patients developed a human anti mouse antibody HAMA response or a human anti ricin antibody HARA response.

In another trial seven low grade non Hodgkin s lymphoma patients previously treated with conventional therapy were treated with the murine CLB CD19 antibody in combination with continuous infusion of low dose interleukin 2 Vlasveld et al. 40 37 47 1995 . A partial remission occurred in one leukemic patient and a greater than 50 reduction of circulating B cells was observed. Circulating B cell numbers were not changed in 4 of 5 remaining patients assessed. Thus the therapeutic evaluation of murine anti CD19 antibodies and anti CD19 antibody based immunotoxins in humans generated anecdotal data that could not be evaluated for efficacy.

Due to the relatively recent appreciation of the role of humoral immunity in acute and chronic graft rejection current therapeutic agents and strategies for targeting humoral immunity are less well developed than those for targeting cellular immunity.

Both cellular T cell mediated and humoral antibody B cell mediated immunity are now known to play significant roles in graft rejection. While the importance of T cell mediated immunity in graft rejection is well established the critical role of humoral immunity in acute and chronic rejection has only recently become evident. Consequently most of the advances in the treatment and prevention of graft rejection have developed from therapeutic agents that target T cell activation. The first therapeutic monoclonal antibody that was FDA approved for the treatment of graft rejection was the murine monoclonal antibody ORTHOCLONE OKT3 muromonab CD3 directed against the CD3 receptor of T cells. OKT3 has been joined by a number of other anti lymphocyte directed antibodies including the monoclonal anti CD52 CAMPATH antibodies CAMPATH 1G CAMPATH 1H alemtuzumab and CAMPATH 1M and polyclonal anti thymocyte antibody preparations referred to as anti thymocyte globulin or ATG also called thymoglobin or thymoglobulin . Other T cell antibodies approved for the prevention of transplant rejection include the chimeric monoclonal antibody SIMULECT basiliximab and the humanized monoclonal antibody ZENAPAX daclizumab both of which target the high affinity IL 2 receptor of activated T cells.

The importance of humoral immunity in graft rejection was initially thought to be limited to hyperacute rejection in which the graft recipient possesses anti donor HLA antibodies prior to transplantation resulting in rapid destruction of the graft in the absence of an effective therapeutic regimen of antibody suppression. Recently it has become evident that humoral immunity is also an important factor mediating both acute and chronic rejection. For example clinical observations demonstrated that graft survival in patients capable of developing class I or class II anti HLA alloantibodies also referred to as anti MHC alloantibodies was reduced compared to graft survival in patients that could not develop such antibodies. Clinical and experimental data also indicate that other donor specific alloantibodies and autoantibodies are critical mediators of rejection. For a current review of the evidence supporting a role for donor specific antibodies in allograft rejection see Rifle et al. 2005 79 S14 S18.

The available strategies for targeting humoral immunity include antibody depletion regimens and anti B lymphocyte directed antibodies. For a recent review of immunological strategies for targeting humoral immunity see Snanoudj et al. 2005 79 S33 35. Examples of antibody depletion regimens include treatment of the recipient with intravenous immunoglobulin the removal of donor reactive antibodies by immunoadsorption and plasmapheresis. Most reports of anti B lymphocyte directed antibodies have focused on anti CD20 antibodies and particularly the chimeric mouse human anti CD20 monoclonal antibody RITUXAN rituximab which is FDA approved for the treatment of some B cell malignancies. More recently rituximab has been evaluated for use in transplantation related therapeutic regimens. For example rituximab has been reported for use in a pre transplant conditioning regimen in a treatment regimen for acute rejection and to reduce the anti ABO antibody titer for ABO incompatible kidney transplantation with mixed results. Sinder et al. 2004 13 55 62 reported a single dose dose escalation phase 1 trial using rituximab for conditioning of dialysis patients awaiting transplantation. The results indicated that rituximab as a single agent partially depleted a subpopulation of B cells and reduced panel reactive alloantibodies. However Viera et al. 2004 77 542 reported only modest reductions in panel reactive alloantibodies using a single dose of rituximab in patients awaiting renal transplantation. Becker et al. 2004 4 996 reported the use of rituximab to treat acute rejection which had previously failed to respond to steroid treatment or to combination therapy with anti thymocyte globulin and plasmapheresis. Rituximab conditioning in combination with other strategies such as immunoadsorption plasmaphoresis and intravenous immunoglobulins without the need for splenectomy was also reported in connection with ABO incompatible kidney transplantations see Tyden et al. 2003 76 730 Sonnenday 2004 4 1315 .

Anti CD19 antibodies may offer advantages over anti CD20 antibodies in being able to target a wider repertoire of B cells but their use in transplantation immunotherapy has been limited primarily to the identification and monitoring of B cells. An additional use of anti CD19 directed antibodies in transplantation was reported by Barfield et al. 2004 6 1 6. Barfield reported anti CD3 antibodies and anti CD19 antibodies conjugated to magnetic microbeads used as affinity reagents to capture T and B lymphocytes from donor peripheral stem cell grafts ex vivo to reduce allogeneic lymphocytes in the graft prior to transplantation.

In addition to the treatment and prevention of graft rejection B cell directed antibodies have been used to treat post transplant lymphoproliferative disorder PTLD see LeVasseur et al. 2003 7 370 75 . PTLD is characterized by hyperproliferative B cells and is associated with Epstein Barr virus infected B cells either originating from the graft or latent in the recipient. Schaar et al. reported a five step protocol for the treatment of PTLD in patients at high risk following solid organ transplants of the pancreas kidney liver heart and kidney 2001 71 47 52 . The regimen included a murine anti CD19 monoclonal antibody of isotype IgG2a in combination with a reduction in the amount of immunosuppressive agents and the addition of anti viral agents interferon alpha and gamma globulins.

In particular antibodies include immunoglobulin molecules and immunologically active fragments of immunoglobulin molecules i.e. molecules that contain an antigen binding site. Immunoglobulin molecules can be of any type e.g. IgG IgE IgM IgD IgA and IgY class e.g. IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 IgG4 IgA1 and IgA2 or subclass.

Native antibodies are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150 000 daltons composed of two identical light L chains and two identical heavy H chains. Each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond while the number of disulfide linkages varies between the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain V followed by a number of constant domains. Each light chain has a variable domain at one end V and a constant domain at its other end the constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain and the light chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light and heavy chain variable domains. Such antibodies may be derived from any mammal including but not limited to humans monkeys pigs horses rabbits dogs cats mice etc.

The term variable refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and are responsible for the binding specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. However the variability is not evenly distributed through the variable domains of antibodies. It is concentrated in segments called Complementarity Determining Regions CDRs both in the light chain and the heavy chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of the variable domains are called the framework regions FR . The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FR regions largely adopting a sheet configuration connected by three CDRs which form loops connecting and in some cases forming part of the sheet structure. The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR regions and with the CDRs from the other chain contribute to the formation of the antigen binding site of antibodies see Kabat et al. 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 . The constant domains are generally not involved directly in antigen binding but may influence antigen binding affinity and may exhibit various effector functions such as participation of the antibody in ADCC.

The term hypervariable region when used herein refers to the amino acid residues of an antibody which are responsible for binding to its antigen. The hypervariable region comprises amino acid residues from a complementarity determining region or CDR e.g. residues 24 34 L1 50 56 L2 and 89 97 L3 in the light chain variable domain and 31 35 H1 50 65 H2 and 95 102 H3 in the heavy chain variable domain Kabat et al. 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 and or those residues from a hypervariable loop e.g. residues 26 32 L1 50 52 L2 and 91 96 L3 in the light chain variable domain and 26 32 H1 53 55 H2 and 96 101 H3 in the heavy chain variable domain Chothia and Lesk 196 901 917 1987 . Framework or FR residues are those variable domain residues other than the hypervariable region residues as herein defined and include chimeric humanized human domain antibodies diabodies vaccibodies linear antibodies and bispecific antibodies.

The term monoclonal antibody as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies i.e. the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore in contrast to conventional polyclonal antibody preparations which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants epitopes each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they are synthesized by the hybridoma cells uncontaminated by other immunoglobulin producing cells. Alternatively the monoclonal antibody may be produced by cells stably or transiently transfected with the heavy and light chain genes encoding the monoclonal antibody.

The modifier monoclonal indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies and is not to be construed as requiring engineering of the antibody by any particular method. The term monoclonal is used herein to refer to an antibody that is derived from a clonal population of cells including any eukaryotic prokaryotic or phage clone and not the method by which the antibody was engineered. For example the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al. 256 495 1975 or may be made by any recombinant DNA method see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 including isolation from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al. 352 624 628 1991 and Marks et al. 222 581 597 1991 for example. These methods can be used to produce monoclonal mammalian chimeric humanized human domain antibodies diabodies vaccibodies linear antibodies and bispecific antibodies.

The term chimeric antibodies includes antibodies in which at least one portion of the heavy and or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass and at least one other portion of the chain s is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass as well as fragments of such antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 Morrison et al. 81 6851 6855 1984 . Chimeric antibodies of interest herein include primatized antibodies comprising variable domain antigen binding sequences derived from a nonhuman primate e.g. Old World Monkey such as baboon rhesus or cynomolgus monkey and human constant region sequences U.S. Pat. No. 5 693 780 .

 Humanized forms of nonhuman e.g. murine antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from nonhuman immunoglobulin. For the most part humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins recipient antibody in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a nonhuman species donor antibody such as mouse rat rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity affinity and capacity. In some instances framework region FR residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding nonhuman residues. Furthermore humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one and typically two variable domains in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a nonhuman immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. In certain embodiments the humanized antibody will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region Fc typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details see Jones et al. 321 522 525 1986 Riechmann et al. 332 323 329 1988 and Presta 2 593 596 1992 .

A human antibody can be an antibody derived from a human or an antibody obtained from a transgenic organism that has been engineered to produce specific human antibodies in response to antigenic challenge and can be produced by any method known in the art. According to preferred techniques elements of the human heavy and light chain loci are introduced into strains of the organism derived from embryonic stem cell lines that contain targeted disruptions of the endogenous heavy chain and light chain loci. The transgenic organism can synthesize human antibodies specific for human antigens and the organism can be used to produce human antibody secreting hybridomas. A human antibody can also be an antibody wherein the heavy and light chains are encoded by a nucleotide sequence derived from one or more sources of human DNA. A fully human antibody also can be constructed by genetic or chromosomal transfection methods as well as phage display technology or in vitro activated B cells all of which are known in the art.

The CD19 antigen refers to an antigen of about 90 kDa identified for example by the HD237 or B4 antibody Kiesel et al. 12 1119 1987 . CD19 is found on cells throughout differentiation of B lineage cells from the stem cell stage through terminal differentiation into plasma cells including but not limited to pre B cells B cells including na ve B cells antigen stimulated B cells memory B cells plasma cells and B lymphocytes and follicular dendritic cells. CD19 is also found on B cells in human fetal tissue. In preferred embodiments the CD19 antigen targeted by the antibodies of the invention is the human CD19 antigen.

 Antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity and ADCC refer to a cell mediated reaction in which non specific cytotoxic cells e.g. Natural Killer NK cells neutrophils and macrophages recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause lysis of the target cell. In preferred embodiments such cells are human cells. While not wishing to be limited to any particular mechanism of action these cytotoxic cells that mediate ADCC generally express Fc receptors FcRs . The primary cells for mediating ADCC NK cells express Fc RIII whereas monocytes express Fc RI Fc RII Fc RIII and or Fc RIV. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Ravetch and Kinet 9 457 92 1991 . To assess ADCC activity of a molecule an in vitro ADCC assay such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 500 362 or 5 821 337 may be performed. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC and Natural Killer NK cells. Alternatively or additionally ADCC activity of the molecules of interest may be assessed in vivo e.g. in an animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. USA 95 652 656 1998 .

 Complement dependent cytotoxicity or CDC refers to the ability of a molecule to initiate complement activation and lyse a target in the presence of complement. The complement activation pathway is initiated by the binding of the first component of the complement system C1q to a molecule e.g. an antibody complexed with a cognate antigen. To assess complement activation a CDC assay e.g. as described in Gazzano Santaro et al. 202 163 1996 may be performed.

 Effector cells are leukocytes which express one or more FcRs and perform effector functions. Preferably the cells express at least Fc RI Fc RII Fc RIII and or Fc RIV and carry out ADCC effector function. Examples of human leukocytes which mediate ADCC include peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC natural killer NK cells monocytes cytotoxic T cells and neutrophils with PBMCs and NK cells being preferred. In preferred embodiments the effector cells are human cells.

The terms Fc receptor or FcR are used to describe a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an antibody. The preferred FcR is a native sequence human FcR. Moreover a preferred FcR is one which binds an IgG antibody a gamma receptor and includes receptors of the Fc RI Fc RII Fc RIII and Fc RIV subclasses including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of these receptors. Fc RII receptors include Fc RIIA an activating receptor and Fc RIIB an inhibiting receptor which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. Activating receptor Fc RIIA contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motif ITAM in its cytoplasmic domain Inhibiting receptor Fc RIIB contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine based inhibition motif ITIM in its cytoplasmic domain. See Da ron 15 203 234 1997 . FcRs are reviewed in Ravetech and Kinet 9 457 92 1991 Capel et al. 4 25 34 1994 and de Haas et al. 126 330 41 1995 . Other FcRs including those to be identified in the future are encompassed by the term FcR herein. The term also includes the neonatal receptor FcRn which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus Guyer et al. 117 587 1976 and Kim et al. 24 249 1994 .

 Fv is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen recognition and binding site. This region consists of a dimer of one heavy and one light chain variable domain in tight non covalent or covalent association. In the Fv configuration the three CDRs of each variable domain interact to define an antigen binding site on the surface of the V Vdimer. Collectively these six CDRs confer antigen binding specificity to the Fv fragment. However even a single variable domain or half of a Fv comprising only three CDRs specific for an antigen has the ability to recognize and bind antigen although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.

 Affinity of an antibody for an epitope to be used in the treatment s described herein is a term well understood in the art and means the extent or strength of binding of antibody to epitope. Affinity may be measured and or expressed in a number of ways known in the art including but not limited to equilibrium dissociation constant KD or Kd apparent equilibrium dissociation constant KD or Kd and IC50 amount needed to effect 50 inhibition in a competition assay . It is understood that for purposes of this invention an affinity is an average affinity for a given population of antibodies which bind to an epitope. Values of KD reported herein in terms of mg IgG per mL or mg mL indicate mg Ig per mL of serum although plasma can be used. When antibody affinity is used as a basis for administration of the treatment methods described herein or selection for the treatment methods described herein antibody affinity can be measured before and or during treatment and the values obtained can be used by a clinician in assessing whether a human patient is an appropriate candidate for treatment.

An epitope is a term well understood in the art and means any chemical moiety that exhibits specific binding to an antibody. An epitope can also comprise an antigen which is a moiety or molecule that contains an epitope and as such also specifically binds to antibody.

A B cell surface marker as used herein is an antigen expressed on the surface of a B cell which can be targeted with an agent which binds thereto. Exemplary B cell surface markers include the CD10 CD19 CD20 CD21 CD22 CD23 CD24 CD25 CD37 CD53 CD72 CD73 CD74 CD75 CD77 CD79a CD79b CD80 CD81 CD82 CD83 CD84 CD85 and CD86 leukocyte surface markers. The B cell surface marker of particular interest is preferentially expressed on B cells compared to other non B cell tissues of a mammal and may be expressed on both precursor B cells and mature B cells. In one embodiment the preferred marker is CD19 which is found on B cells throughout differentiation of the lineage from the pro pre B cell stage through the terminally differentiated plasma cell stage.

The term antibody half life as used herein means a pharmacokinetic property of an antibody that is a measure of the mean survival time of antibody molecules following their administration. Antibody half life can be expressed as the time required to eliminate 50 percent of a known quantity of immunoglobulin from the patient s body or a specific compartment thereof for example as measured in serum i.e. circulating half life or in other tissues. Half life may vary from one immunoglobulin or class of immunoglobulin to another. In general an increase in antibody half life results in an increase in mean residence time MRT in circulation for the antibody administered.

The term isotype refers to the classification of an antibody. The constant domains of antibodies are not involved in binding to antigen but may exhibit various effector functions. Depending on the amino acid sequence of the heavy chain constant region a given antibody or immunoglobulin can be assigned to one of five major classes of immunoglobulins IgA IgD IgE IgG and IgM. Several of these classes may be further divided into subclasses isotypes e.g. IgG1 gamma 1 IgG2 gamma 2 IgG3 gamma 3 and IgG4 gamma 4 and IgA1 and IgA2. The heavy chain constant regions that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called and respectively. The structures and three dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known. Of the various human immunoglobulin classes only human IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 IgG4 and IgM are known to activate complement. Human IgG1 and IgG3 are known to mediate ADCC in humans.

As used herein the term immunogenicity means that a compound is capable of provoking an immune response stimulating production of specific antibodies and or proliferation of specific T cells .

As used herein the term antigenicity means that a compound is recognized by an antibody or may bind to an antibody and induce an immune response.

As used herein the term avidity is a measure of the overall binding strength i.e. both antibody arms with which an antibody binds an antigen. Antibody avidity can be determined by measuring the dissociation of the antigen antibody bond in antigen excess using any means known in the art such as but not limited to by the modification of indirect fluorescent antibody as described by Gray et al. 44 11 24. 1993 .

By the terms treat treating or treatment of or grammatically equivalent terms it is meant that the severity of the subject s condition is reduced or at least partially improved or ameliorated and or that some alleviation mitigation or decrease in at least one clinical symptom is achieved and or there is an inhibition or delay in the progression of the condition and or prevention or delay of the onset of a disease or illness. The terms treat treating or treatment of also means managing an autoimmune disease or disorder. Thus the terms treat treating or treatment of or grammatically equivalent terms refer to both prophylactic and therapeutic treatment regimes.

As used herein a sufficient amount or an amount sufficient to achieve a particular result refers to an amount of an antibody or composition of the invention that is effective to produce a desired effect which is optionally a therapeutic effect i.e. by administration of a therapeutically effective amount . For example a sufficient amount or an amount sufficient to can be an amount that is effective to deplete B cells.

A therapeutically effective amount as used herein is an amount that provides some improvement or benefit to the subject. Alternatively stated a therapeutically effective amount is an amount that provides some alleviation mitigation and or decrease in at least one clinical symptom. Clinical symptoms associated with the disorders that can be treated by the methods of the invention are well known to those skilled in the art. Further those skilled in the art will appreciate that the therapeutic effects need not be complete or curative as long as some benefit is provided to the subject.

The present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising human humanized or chimeric anti CD19 antibodies of the IgG1 or IgG3 human isotype. The present invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising human or humanized anti CD19 antibodies of the IgG2 or IgG4 human isotype that preferably mediate human ADCC. In certain embodiments the present invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising monoclonal human humanized or chimerized anti CD19 antibodies that can be produced by means known in the art.

In certain embodiments the invention relates to immunotherapeutic compositions and methods for the treatment of B cell diseases and disorders in human subjects such as but not limited to B cell malignancies using therapeutic antibodies that bind to the CD19 antigen and preferably mediate human ADCC. Therapeutic formulations and regimens are described for treating human subjects diagnosed with B cell malignancies that derive from B cells and their precursors including but not limited to acute lymphoblastic leukemias ALL Hodgkin s lymphomas non Hodgkin s lymphomas B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias CLL multiple myeloma follicular lymphoma mantle cell lymphoma pro lymphocytic leukemias hairy cell leukemias common acute lymphocytic leukemias and some Null acute lymphoblastic leukemias

In certain embodiments the invention relates to immunotherapeutic compositions and methods for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and disorders in human subjects using therapeutic antibodies that bind to the CD19 antigen and preferably mediate human ADCC. Therapeutic formulations and regimens are described for treating human subjects diagnosed with autoimmune diseases or disorders including but not limited to rheumatoid arthritis SLE ITP pemphigus related disorders diabetes and scleroderma.

In certain embodiments the invention relates to immunotherapeutic compositions and methods for the treatment and prevention of GVHD graft rejection and post transplant lymphocyte proliferative disorder in human transplant recipients using therapeutic antibodies that bind to the CD19 antigen and preferably mediate human ADCC. In particular embodiments the anti CD19 antibodies of the invention mediate ADCC complement dependent cellular cytotoxicity or apoptosis. The compositions and methods of the invention have the advantage of specifically targeting B cells leaving intact other functional elements and cell types of the immune system. Accordingly in one aspect the invention provides compositions and methods for the treatment and prevention of GVHD graft rejection and post transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder which are associated with fewer and or less severe complications than less targeted therapeutic agents and regimens. In one embodiment the compositions and methods of the invention are used in combination with lower doses of traditional therapeutic agents than would be possible in the absence of the methods and compositions of the invention.

In another embodiment the compositions and methods of the invention obviate the need for a more severe form of therapy such as radiation therapy high dose chemotherapy or splenectomy.

The compositions and methods of the invention also have the advantage of targeting a wider population of B cells than other B cell directed immunotherapies. For example the anti CD19 antibodies of the present invention are effective to target bone marrow B cells circulating B cells and mature antibody secreting B cells. Accordingly the methods and compositions of the invention are effective to reduce or deplete circulating B cells as well as circulating immunoglobulin see for example .

In certain embodiments the anti CD19 antibodies and compositions of the invention may be administered to a transplant recipient prior to or following transplantation alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents or regimens for the treatment or prevention of GVHD and graft rejection. For example the anti CD19 antibodies and compositions of the invention may be used to deplete alloantibodies from a transplant recipient prior to or following transplantation of an allogeneic graft. The anti CD19 antibodies and compositions of the invention may also be used to deplete antibody producing cells from the graft ex vivo prior to transplantation or in the donor as prophylaxis against GVHD and graft rejection.

The transplant recipient in need of prophylaxis or treatment for humoral rejection is identified according to the knowledge and skill in the art. For example a transplant recipient in need of prophylaxis against graft rejection may be identified as a patient or patient population having detectable circulating anti HLA alloantibodies prior to transplantation. In another example the patient or patient population is identified as having panel reactive alloantibodies prior to transplantation. The presence of detectable circulating anti HLA alloantibodies in a transplant recipient post transplantation can also be used to identify the patient or patient population in need of treatment for humoral rejection according to the invention. The patient or patient population in need of treatment for humoral rejection can also be identified according to other clinical criteria which indicate that a transplant recipient is at risk for developing a humoral rejection or has already developed a humoral rejection. For example a transplant recipient in need of treatment for humoral rejection may be identified as a patient or patient population in an early stage of humoral rejection such as a latent humoral response characterized by circulating anti donor alloantibodies. An early stage of humoral rejection may also be a silent reaction characterized by circulating anti donor alloantibodies and C4d deposition or a subclinical rejection characterized by circulating anti donor alloantibodies C4d deposition and tissue pathology. In later stages the recipient is identified as a patient or patient population presenting with clinical indications of humoral rejection characterized according to the knowledge and skill in the art for example by circulating anti donor alloantibodies C4d deposition tissue pathology and graft dysfunction.

The present invention provides compositions and methods effective to reduce the incidence severity or duration of GVHD a rejection episode or post transplant lymphoproliferative disorder. In certain embodiments the compositions and methods of the invention are effective to attenuate the host response to ischemic reperfusion injury of a solid tissue or organ graft. In a preferred embodiment the anti CD19 antibody compositions and methods of the invention are effective to prolong survival of a graft in a transplant recipient.

Therapeutic formulations and regimens are described for treating or preventing GVHD humoral rejection and post transplant lymphoproliferative disorder. The present invention encompasses grafts that are autologous allogeneic or xenogeneic to the recipient. The types of grafts encompassed by the invention include tissue and organ grafts including but not limited to bone marrow grafts peripheral blood stem cell grafts skin grafts arterial and venous grafts pancreatic islet cell grafts and transplants of the kidney liver pancreas thyroid and heart. The terms graft and transplant are used interchangeably herein. In one embodiment the autologous graft is a bone marrow graft an arterial graft a venous graft or a skin graft. In one embodiment the allograft is a bone marrow graft a corneal graft a kidney transplant a heart transplant a liver transplant a lung transplant a pancreatic transplant a pancreatic islet cell transplant or a combined transplant of a kidney and pancreas. In one embodiment the graft is a xenograft preferably wherein the donor is a pig. The compositions and methods of the present invention may also be used to suppress a deleterious immune response to a non biological graft or implant including but not limited to an artificial joint a stent or a pacemaker device.

The anti CD19 antibodies compositions and methods of the invention can be used to treat or prevent GVHD humoral rejection or post transplant lymphoproliferative disorder without regard to the particular indications initially giving rise to the need for the transplant or to the particular type of tissue transplanted. However the indications which gave rise to the need for a transplant and the type of tissue transplanted may provide the basis for a comprehensive therapeutic regimen for the treatment or prevention of GVHD graft rejection and post transplant lymphoproliferative disorder which comprehensive regimen comprises the anti CD19 antibody compositions and methods of the invention. A more detailed description of diagnostic criteria and therapeutic regimens is provided below.

Polyclonal antibodies are preferably raised in animals by multiple subcutaneous s.c. or intraperitoneal i.p. injections of the relevant antigen and an adjuvant. It may be useful to conjugate the relevant antigen to a protein that is immunogenic in the species to be immunized e.g. keyhole limpet hemocyanin serum albumin bovine thyroglobulin or soybean trypsin inhibitor using a bifunctional or derivatizing agent for example maleimidobertzoyl sulfosuccinimide ester conjugation through cysteine residues N hydroxysuccinimide through lysine residues glutaraldehyde succunic anhydride SOCl.

Animals are immunized against the antigen immunogenic conjugates or derivatives by combining e.g. 100 g or 5 g of the protein or conjugate for rabbits or mice respectively with 3 volumes of Freund s complete adjuvant and injecting the solution intradermally at multiple sites. One month later the animals are boosted with to 1 10 the original amount of peptide or conjugate in Freund s incomplete adjuvant by subcutaneous injection at multiple sites. Seven to 14 days later the animals are bled and the serum is assayed for antibody titer. Animals are boosted until the titer plateaus. Preferably the animal is boosted with the conjugate of the same antigen but conjugated to a different protein and or through a different cross linking reagent. Conjugates also can be made in recombinant cell culture as protein fusions. Also aggregating agents such as alum are suitably used to enhance the immune response.

The monoclonal anti CD19 antibodies of the invention exhibit binding specificity to human CD19 antigen and can preferably mediate human ADCC. These antibodies can be generated using a wide variety of techniques known in the art including the use of hybridoma recombinant and phage display technologies or a combination thereof. Antibodies are highly specific being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore in contrast to conventional polyclonal antibody preparations which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants epitopes each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the human CD19 antigen. For example the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al. 256 495 1975 which can be used to generate murine antibodies or antibodies derived from other nonhuman mammals e.g. rat goat sheep cows camels etc. or human antibodies derived from transgenic animals see U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 075 181 6 114 598 6 150 584 and 6 657 103 . Alternatively the monoclonal antibodies can be made by recombinant DNA methods see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 and include chimeric and humanized antibodies. The monoclonal antibodies may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al. 352 624 628 1991 and Marks et al. 222 581 597 1991 for example.

An engineered anti CD19 antibody can be produced by any means known in the art including but not limited to those techniques described below and improvements to those techniques. Large scale high yield production typically involves culturing a host cell that produces the engineered anti CD19 antibody and recovering the anti CD19 antibody from the host cell culture.

Monoclonal antibodies can be produced using hybridoma techniques including those known in the art and taught for example in Harlow et al. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 2nd ed. 1988 Hammerling et al. in 563 681 Elsevier N.Y. 1981 said references incorporated by reference in their entireties . For example in the hybridoma method a mouse or other appropriate host animal such as a hamster or macaque monkey is immunized to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the protein used for immunization. Alternatively lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro. Lymphocytes then are fused with myeloma cells using a suitable fusing agent such as polyethylene glycol to form a hybridoma cell Goding pp. 59 103 Academic Press 1986 .

The hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused parental myeloma cells. For example if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase HGPRT or HPRT the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine aminopterin and thymidine HAT medium which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT deficient cells.

Preferred myeloma cells are those that fuse efficiently support stable high level production of antibody by the selected antibody producing cells and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. Among these preferred myeloma cell lines are murine myeloma lines such as those derived from MOPC 21 and MPC 11 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center San Diego Calif. USA and SP 2 or X63 Ag8.653 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection Rockville Md. USA. Human myeloma and mouse human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies Kozbor 133 3001 1984 Brodeur et al. pp. 51 63 Marcel Dekker Inc. NY 1987 .

Culture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies directed against the human CD19 antigen. Preferably the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay such as radioimmunoassay RIA or enzyme linked immunoabsorbent assay ELISA .

After hybridoma cells are identified that produce antibodies of the desired specificity affinity and or activity the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods Goding pp. 59 103 Academic Press 1986 . Suitable culture media for this purpose include for example D MEM or RPMI 1640 medium. In addition the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites tumors in an animal.

The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium ascites fluid or serum by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as for example protein A Sepharose hydroxylapatite chromatography gel electrophoresis dialysis or affinity chromatography.

DNA encoding the anti CD19 antibodies of the invention is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures e.g. by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the anti CD19 antibodies . The hybridoma cells serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated the DNA may be placed into expression vectors which are then transfected into host cells such as cells simian COS cells Chinese hamster ovary CHO cells or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein to obtain the synthesis of anti CD19 antibodies in the recombinant host cells.

In phage display methods functional antibody domains are displayed on the surface of phage particles which carry the polynucleotide sequences encoding them. In particular DNA sequences encoding Vand Vdomains are amplified from animal cDNA libraries e.g. human or murine cDNA libraries of affected tissues . The DNA encoding the Vand Vdomains are recombined together with an scFv linker by PCR and cloned into a phagemid vector. The vector is electroporated in and the is infected with helper phage. Phage used in these methods are typically filamentous phage including fd and M13 and the Vand Vdomains are usually recombinantly fused to either the phage gene III or gene VIII. Phage expressing an antigen binding domain that binds to a particular antigen can be selected or identified with antigen e.g. using labeled antigen or antigen bound or captured to a solid surface or bead. Examples of phage display methods that can be used to make the antibodies of the present invention include those disclosed in Brinkman et al. 1995182 41 50 Ames et al. 1995184 177 186 Kettleborough et al. 199424 952 958 Persic et al. 1997187 9 18 Burton et al. 199457 191 280 International Application No. PCT GB91 O1 134 International Publication Nos.

As described in the above references after phage selection the antibody coding regions from the phage can be isolated and used to generate whole antibodies including human antibodies or any other desired antigen binding fragment and expressed in any desired host including mammalian cells insect cells plant cells yeast and bacteria e.g. as described below. Techniques to recombinantly produce Fab Fab and F ab fragments can also be employed using methods known in the art such as those disclosed in PCT Publication No. WO 92 22324 Mullinax et al. 199212 6 864 869 Sawai et al. 1995 AJRI 34 26 34 and Better et al. 1988240 1041 1043 said references incorporated by reference in their entireties .

In a further embodiment antibodies may be isolated from antibody phage libraries generated using the techniques described in McCafferty et al. 348 552 554 1990 . Clackson et al. 352 624 628 1991 . Marks et al. 222 581 597 1991 describe the isolation of murine and human antibodies respectively using phage libraries. Chain shuffling can be used in the production of high affinity nM range human antibodies Marks et al. 10 779 783 1992 as well as combinatorial infection and in vivo recombination as a strategy for constructing very large phage libraries Waterhouse et al. 21 2265 2266 1993 . Thus these techniques are viable alternatives to traditional monoclonal antibody hybridoma techniques for isolation of anti CD19 antibodies.

To generate whole antibodies PCR primers including Vor Vnucleotide sequences a restriction site and a flanking sequence to protect the restriction site can be used to amplify the Vor Vsequences in scFv clones. Utilizing cloning techniques known to those of skill in the art the PCR amplified Vdomains can be cloned into vectors expressing a Vconstant region e.g. the human gamma 4 constant region and the PCR amplified Vdomains can be cloned into vectors expressing a Vconstant region e.g. human kappa or lambda constant regions. Preferably the vectors for expressing the Vor Vdomains comprise an EF 1 promoter a secretion signal a cloning site for the variable domain constant domains and a selection marker such as neomycin. The Vand Vdomains may also be cloned into one vector expressing the necessary constant regions. The heavy chain conversion vectors and light chain conversion vectors are then co transfected into cell lines to generate stable or transient cell lines that express full length antibodies e.g. IgG using techniques known to those of skill in the art.

The DNA also may be modified for example by substituting the coding sequence for human heavy and light chain constant domains in place of the homologous murine sequences U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 Morrison et al. 81 6851 1984 or by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non immunoglobulin polypeptide.

The anti CD19 antibodies herein specifically include chimeric antibodies immunoglobulins in which a portion of the heavy and or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass while another portion of the chain s is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass as well as fragments of such antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 Morrison et al. 81 6851 6855 1984 . Chimeric antibodies of interest herein include primatized antibodies comprising variable domain antigen binding sequences derived from a nonhuman primate e.g. Old World Monkey such as baboon rhesus or cynomolgus monkey and human constant region sequences U.S. Pat. No. 5 693 780 .

A humanized antibody can be produced using a variety of techniques known in the art including but not limited to CDR grafting see e.g. European Patent No. EP 239 400 International Publication No. WO 91 09967 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 225 539 5 530 101 and 5 585 089 each of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference veneering or resurfacing see e.g. European Patent Nos. EP 592 106 and EP 519 596 Padlan 199128 4 5 489 498 Studnicka et al. 19947 6 805 814 and Roguska et al. 199491 969 973 each of which is incorporated herein by its entirety by reference chain shuffling see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 565 332 which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference and techniques disclosed in e.g. U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US2005 0042664 U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US2005 0048617 U.S. Pat. No. 6 407 213 U.S. Pat. No. 5 766 886 International Publication No. WO 9317105 Tan et al. 169 1119 25 2002 Caldas et al. 13 5 353 60 2000 Morea et al. 20 3 267 79 2000 Baca et al. 272 16 10678 84 1997 Roguska et al. 9 10 895 904 1996 Couto et al. 55 23 Supp 5973s 5977s 1995 Couto et al. 55 8 1717 22 1995 Sandhu J S 150 2 409 10 1994 and Pedersen et al. 235 3 959 73 1994 each of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. Often framework residues in the framework regions will be substituted with the corresponding residue from the CDR donor antibody to alter preferably improve antigen binding. These framework substitutions are identified by methods well known in the art e.g. by modeling of the interactions of the CDR and framework residues to identify framework residues important for antigen binding and sequence comparison to identify unusual framework residues at particular positions. See e.g. Queen et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 585 089 and Riechmann et al. 1988332 323 which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. 

A humanized anti CD19 antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is nonhuman. These nonhuman amino acid residues are often referred to as import residues which are typically taken from an import variable domain. Thus humanized antibodies comprise one or more CDRs from nonhuman immunoglobulin molecules and framework regions from human. Humanization of antibodies is well known in the art and can essentially be performed following the method of Winter and co workers Jones et al. 321 522 525 1986 Riechmann et al. 332 323 327 1988 Verhoeyen et al. 239 1534 1536 1988 by substituting rodent CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody i.e. CDR grafting EP 239 400 PCT Publication No. WO 91 09967 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 816 567 6 331 415 5 225 539 5 530 101 5 585 089 6 548 640 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference herein in their entirety . In such humanized chimeric antibodies substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a nonhuman species. In practice humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some CDR residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies. Humanization of anti CD19 antibodies can also be achieved by veneering or resurfacing EP 592 106 EP 519 596 Padlan 199128 4 5 489 498 Studnicka et al. 7 6 805 814 1994 and Roguska et al. 91 969 973 1994 or chain shuffling U.S. Pat. No. 5 565 332 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference herein in their entirety.

The choice of human variable domains both light and heavy to be used in making the humanized antibodies is to reduce antigenicity. According to the so called best fit method the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire library of known human variable domain sequences. The human sequence which is closest to that of the rodent is then accepted as the human framework FR for the humanized antibody Sims et al. 151 2296 1993 Chothia et al. 196 901 1987 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference herein in their entirety . Another method uses a particular framework derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework may be used for several different humanized anti CD19 antibodies Carter et al. 89 4285 1992 Presta et al. 151 2623 1993 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference herein in their entirety .

Anti CD19 antibodies can be humanized with retention of high affinity for CD19 and other favorable biological properties. According to one aspect of the invention humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence i.e. the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind CD19. In this way FR residues can be selected and combined from the recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic such as increased affinity for CD19 is achieved. In general the CDR residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding.

A humanized antibody retains a similar antigenic specificity as the original antibody i.e. in the present invention the ability to bind human CD19 antigen. However using certain methods of humanization the affinity and or specificity of binding of the antibody for human CD19 antigen may be increased using methods of directed evolution as described by Wu et al. 294 151 1999 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference herein in their entirety.

For in vivo use of antibodies in humans it may be preferable to use human antibodies. Completely human antibodies are particularly desirable for therapeutic treatment of human subjects. Human antibodies can be made by a variety of methods known in the art including phage display methods described above using antibody libraries derived from human immunoglobulin sequences including improvements to these techniques. See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 444 887 and 4 716 111 and PCT publications WO 98 46645 WO 98 50433 WO 98 24893 WO98 16654 WO 96 34096 WO 96 33735 and WO 91 10741 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. A human antibody can also be an antibody wherein the heavy and light chains are encoded by a nucleotide sequence derived from one or more sources of human DNA.

Human anti CD19 antibodies can also be produced using transgenic mice which are incapable of expressing functional endogenous immunoglobulins but which can express human immunoglobulin genes. For example the human heavy and light chain immunoglobulin gene complexes may be introduced randomly or by homologous recombination into mouse embryonic stem cells. Alternatively the human variable region constant region and diversity region may be introduced into mouse embryonic stem cells in addition to the human heavy and light chain genes. The mouse heavy and light chain immunoglobulin genes may be rendered non functional separately or simultaneously with the introduction of human immunoglobulin loci by homologous recombination. For example it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy chain joining region JH gene in chimeric and germ line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production. The modified embryonic stem cells are expanded and microinjected into blastocysts to produce chimeric mice. The chimeric mice are then bred to produce homozygous offspring which express human antibodies. The transgenic mice are immunized in the normal fashion with a selected antigen e.g. all or a portion of a polypeptide of the invention. Anti CD19 antibodies directed against the human CD19 antigen can be obtained from the immunized transgenic mice using conventional hybridoma technology. The human immunoglobulin transgenes harbored by the transgenic mice rearrange during B cell differentiation and subsequently undergo class switching and somatic mutation. Thus using such a technique it is possible to produce therapeutically useful IgG IgA IgM and IgE antibodies including but not limited to IgG1 gamma 1 and IgG3. For an overview of this technology for producing human antibodies see Lonberg and Huszar Int. Rev. Immunol. 13 65 93 1995 . For a detailed discussion of this technology for producing human antibodies and human monoclonal antibodies and protocols for producing such antibodies see e.g. PCT Publication Nos. WO 98 24893 WO 96 34096 and WO 96 33735 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 413 923 5 625 126 5 633 425 5 569 825 5 661 016 5 545 806 5 814 318 and 5 939 598 each of which is incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. In addition companies such as Abgenix Inc. Freemont Calif. and Genpharm San Jose Calif. can be engaged to provide human antibodies directed against a selected antigen using technology similar to that described above. For a specific discussion of transfer of a human germ line immunoglobulin gene array in germ line mutant mice that will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge see e.g. Jakobovits et al. 90 2551 1993 Jakobovits et al. 362 255 258 1993 Bruggermann et al. 7 33 1993 and Duchosal et al. 355 258 1992 .

Human antibodies can also be derived from phage display libraries Hoogenboom et al. 227 381 1991 Marks et al. 222 581 597 1991 Vaughan et al. 14 309 1996 . Phage display technology McCafferty et al. 348 552 553 1990 can be used to produce human antibodies and antibody fragments in vitro from immunoglobulin variable V domain gene repertoires from unimmunized donors. According to this technique antibody V domain genes are cloned in frame into either a major or minor coat protein gene of a filamentous bacteriophage such as M13 or fd and displayed as functional antibody fragments on the surface of the phage particle. Because the filamentous particle contains a single stranded DNA copy of the phage genome selections based on the functional properties of the antibody also result in selection of the gene encoding the antibody exhibiting those properties. Thus the phage mimics some of the properties of the B cell. Phage display can be performed in a variety of formats for their review see e.g. Johnson Kevin S and Chiswell David J. 3 564 571 1993 . Several sources of V gene segments can be used for phage display. Clackson et al. 352 624 628 1991 isolated a diverse array of anti oxazolone antibodies from a small random combinatorial library of V genes derived from the spleens of unimmunized mice. A repertoire of V genes from unimmunized human donors can be constructed and antibodies to a diverse array of antigens including self antigens can be isolated essentially following the techniques described by Marks et al. 222 581 597 1991 or Griffith et al. 12 725 734 1993 .

Human antibodies may also be generated by in vitro activated B cells see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 567 610 and 5 229 275 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety . Human antibodies may also be generated in vitro using hybridoma techniques such as but not limited to that described by Roder et al. 121 140 167 1986 .

The anti CD19 antibodies of the compositions and methods of the invention can be mutant antibodies. As used herein antibody mutant or altered antibody refers to an amino acid sequence variant of an anti CD19 antibody wherein one or more of the amino acid residues of an anti CD19 antibody have been modified. The modifications to the amino acid sequence of the anti CD19 antibody include modifications to the sequence to improve affinity or avidity of the antibody for its antigen and or modifications to the Fc portion of the antibody to improve effector function. The modifications may be made to any known anti CD19 antibodies or anti CD19 antibodies identified as described herein. Such altered antibodies necessarily have less than 100 sequence identity or similarity with a known anti CD19 antibody. In a preferred embodiment the altered antibody will have an amino acid sequence having at least 25 35 45 55 65 or 75 amino acid sequence identity or similarity with the amino acid sequence of either the heavy or light chain variable domain of an anti CD19 antibody more preferably at least 80 more preferably at least 85 more preferably at least 90 and most preferably at least 95 . In a preferred embodiment the altered antibody will have an amino acid sequence having at least 25 35 45 55 65 or 75 amino acid sequence identity or similarity with the amino acid sequence of the heavy chain CDR1 CDR2 or CDR3 of an anti CD19 antibody more preferably at least 80 more preferably at least 85 more preferably at least 90 and most preferably at least 95 . In a preferred embodiment the altered antibody will maintain human CD19 binding capability. In certain embodiments the anti CD19 antibody of the invention comprises a heavy chain that is about 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 or more identical to an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 2 corresponding to the heavy chain of HB12a. In certain embodiments the anti CD19 antibody of the invention comprises a heavy chain that is about 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 or more identical to an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 4 corresponding to the heavy chain of HB12b. In certain embodiments the anti CD19 antibody of the invention comprises a light chain that is about 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 or more identical to an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 16 corresponding to the light chain of HB12a. In certain embodiments the anti CD19 antibody of the invention comprises a light chain that is about 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 or more identical to an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 18 corresponding to the light chain of HB12b. In a preferred embodiment the altered antibody will have an amino acid sequence having at least 25 35 45 55 65 or 75 amino acid sequence identity or similarity with the amino acid sequence of light chain CDR1 CDR2 or CDR3 of an anti CD19 antibody more preferably at least 80 more preferably at least 85 more preferably at least 90 and most preferably at least 95 . Hybridomas producing HB12a and HB12b anti CD19 antibodies have been deposited under ATCC deposit nos. PTA 6580 and PTA 6581.

Identity or similarity with respect to this sequence is defined herein as the percentage of amino acid residues in the candidate sequence that are identical i.e. same residue or similar i.e. amino acid residue from the same group based on common side chain properties see below with anti CD19 antibody residues after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps if necessary to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity. None of N terminal C terminal or internal extensions deletions or insertions into the antibody sequence outside of the variable domain shall be construed as affecting sequence identity or similarity.

 identity as known in the art is a measure of the relationship between two polynucleotides or two polypeptides as determined by comparing their sequences. In general the two sequences to be compared are aligned to give a maximum correlation between the sequences. The alignment of the two sequences is examined and the number of positions giving an exact amino acid or nucleotide correspondence between the two sequences determined divided by the total length of the alignment and multiplied by 100 to give a identity figure. This identity figure may be determined over the whole length of the sequences to be compared which is particularly suitable for sequences of the same or very similar length and which are highly homologous or over shorter defined lengths which is more suitable for sequences of unequal length or which have a lower level of homology.

For example sequences can be aligned with the software clustalW under Unix which generates a file with an .aln extension this file can then be imported into the Bioedit program Hall T. A. 1999 95 9841 95 98 which opens the .aln file. In the Bioedit window one can choose individual sequences two at a time and alignment them. This method allows for comparison of the entire sequence.

Methods for comparing the identity of two or more sequences are well known in the art. Thus for instance programs are available in the Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package version 9.1 Devereux J. et al. 12 387 395 1984 available from Genetics Computer Group Madison Wis. USA . The determination of percent identity between two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. For example the programs BESTFIT and GAP may be used to determine the identity between two polynucleotides and the identity between two polypeptide sequences. BESTFIT uses the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman Advances in Applied Mathematics 2 482 489 1981 and finds the best single region of similarity between two sequences. BESTFIT is more suited to comparing two polynucleotide or two polypeptide sequences which are dissimilar in length the program assuming that the shorter sequence represents a portion of the longer. In comparison GAP aligns two sequences finding a maximum similarity according to the algorithm of Neddleman and Wunsch 48 443 354 1970 . GAP is more suited to comparing sequences which are approximately the same length and an alignment is expected over the entire length. Preferably the parameters Gap Weight and Length Weight used in each program are 50 and 3 for polynucleotides and 12 and 4 for polypeptides respectively. Preferably identities and similarities are determined when the two sequences being compared are optimally aligned.

Other programs for determining identity and or similarity between sequences are also known in the art for instance the BLAST family of programs Karlin Altschul 199087 2264 2268 modified as in Karlin Altschul 199390 5873 5877 available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information NCB Bethesda Md. USA and accessible through the home page of the NCBI at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov . These programs exemplify a preferred non limiting example of a mathematical algorithm utilized for the comparison of two sequences. Such an algorithm is incorporated into the NBLAST and XBLAST programs of Altschul et al. 1990215 403 410. BLAST nucleotide searches can be performed with the NBLAST program score 100 wordlength 12 to obtain nucleotide sequences homologous to a nucleic acid molecule encoding all or a portion if an anti CD19 antibody of the invention. BLAST protein searches can be performed with the XBLAST program score 50 wordlength 3 to obtain amino acid sequences homologous to a protein molecule of the invention. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes Gapped BLAST can be utilized as described in Altschul et al. 1997 25 3389 3402. Alternatively PSI Blast can be used to perform an iterated search which detects distant relationships between molecules Id. . When utilizing BLAST Gapped BLAST and PSI Blast programs the default parameters of the respective programs e.g. XBLAST and NBLAST can be used. See http www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. Another preferred non limiting example of a mathematical algorithm utilized for the comparison of sequences is the algorithm of Myers and Miller 19884 11 17. Such an algorithm is incorporated into the ALIGN program version 2.0 which is part of the GCG sequence alignment software package. When utilizing the ALIGN program for comparing amino acid sequences a PAM120 weight residue table a gap length penalty of 12 and a gap penalty of 4 can be used.

Another non limiting example of a program for determining identity and or similarity between sequences known in the art is FASTA Pearson W. R. and Lipman D. J. 85 2444 2448 1988 available as part of the Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package . Preferably the BLOSUM62 amino acid substitution matrix Henikoff S and Henikoff J. G. 89 10915 10919 1992 is used in polypeptide sequence comparisons including where nucleotide sequences are first translated into amino acid sequences before comparison.

Yet another non limiting example of a program known in the art for determining identity and or similarity between amino acid sequences is SeqWeb Software a web based interface to the GCG Wisconsin Package Gap program which is utilized with the default algorithm and parameter settings of the program blosum62 gap weight 8 length weight 2.

The percent identity between two sequences can be determined using techniques similar to those described above with or without allowing gaps. In calculating percent identity typically exact matches are counted.

Preferably the program BESTFIT is used to determine the identity of a query polynucleotide or a polypeptide sequence with respect to a polynucleotide or a polypeptide sequence of the present invention the query and the reference sequence being optimally aligned and the parameters of the program set at the default value.

To generate an altered antibody one or more amino acid alterations e.g. substitutions are introduced in one or more of the hypervariable regions of the species dependent antibody. Alternatively or in addition one or more alterations e.g. substitutions of framework region residues may be introduced in an anti CD19 antibody where these result in an improvement in the binding affinity of the antibody mutant for the antigen from the second mammalian species. Examples of framework region residues to modify include those which non covalently bind antigen directly Amit et al. 233 747 753 1986 interact with effect the conformation of a CDR Chothia et al. 196 901 917 1987 and or participate in the V Vinterface EP 239 400B1 . In certain embodiments modification of one or more of such framework region residues results in an enhancement of the binding affinity of the antibody for the antigen from the second mammalian species. For example from about one to about five framework residues may be altered in this embodiment of the invention. Sometimes this may be sufficient to yield an antibody mutant suitable for use in preclinical trials even where none of the hypervariable region residues have been altered. Normally however an altered antibody will comprise additional hypervariable region alteration s .

The hypervariable region residues which are altered may be changed randomly especially where the starting binding affinity of an anti CD19 antibody for the antigen from the second mammalian species is such that such randomly produced altered antibody can be readily screened.

One useful procedure for generating such an altered antibody is called alanine scanning mutagenesis Cunningham and Wells 244 1081 1085 1989 . Here one or more of the hypervariable region residue s are replaced by alanine or polyalanine residue s to affect the interaction of the amino acids with the antigen from the second mammalian species. Those hypervariable region residue s demonstrating functional sensitivity to the substitutions then are refined by introducing additional or other mutations at or for the sites of substitution. Thus while the site for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is predetermined the nature of the mutation per se need not be predetermined. The Ala mutants produced this way are screened for their biological activity as described herein.

Another procedure for generating such an altered antibody involves affinity maturation using phage display Hawkins et al. 254 889 896 1992 and Lowman et al. 30 45 10832 10837 1991 . Briefly several hypervariable region sites e.g. 6 7 sites are mutated to generate all possible amino acid substitutions at each site. The antibody mutants thus generated are displayed in a monovalent fashion from filamentous phage particles as fusions to the gene III product of M13 packaged within each particle. The phage displayed mutants are then screened for their biological activity e.g. binding affinity as herein disclosed.

Mutations in antibody sequences may include substitutions deletions including internal deletions additions including additions yielding fusion proteins or conservative substitutions of amino acid residues within and or adjacent to the amino acid sequence but that result in a silent change in that the change produces a functionally equivalent anti CD19 antibody. Conservative amino acid substitutions may be made on the basis of similarity in polarity charge solubility hydrophobicity hydrophilicity and or the amphipathic nature of the residues involved. For example non polar hydrophobic amino acids include alanine leucine isoleucine valine proline phenylalanine tryptophan and methionine polar neutral amino acids include glycine serine threonine cysteine tyrosine asparagine and glutamine positively charged basic amino acids include arginine lysine and histidine and negatively charged acidic amino acids include aspartic acid and glutamic acid. In addition glycine and proline are residues that can influence chain orientation. Non conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class. Furthermore if desired non classical amino acids or chemical amino acid analogs can be introduced as a substitution or addition into the antibody sequence. Non classical amino acids include but are not limited to the D isomers of the common amino acids amino isobutyric acid 4 aminobutyric acid Abu 2 amino butyric acid Abu Ahx 6 amino hexanoic acid Aib 2 amino isobutyric acid 3 amino propionic acid ornithine norleucine norvaline hydroxyproline sarcosine citrulline cysteic acid t butylglycine t butylalanine phenylglycine cyclohexylalanine alanine fluoro amino acids designer amino acids such as methyl amino acids C methyl amino acids N methyl amino acids and amino acid analogs in general.

In another embodiment the sites selected for modification are affinity matured using phage display see above .

Any technique for mutagenesis known in the art can be used to modify individual nucleotides in a DNA sequence for purposes of making amino acid substitution s in the antibody sequence or for creating deleting restriction sites to facilitate further manipulations.

In certain embodiments of the invention the anti CD19 antibodies can be modified to produce fusion proteins i.e. the antibody or a fragment fused to a heterologous protein polypeptide or peptide. In certain embodiments the protein fused to the portion of an anti CD19 antibody is an enzyme component of ADEPT. Examples of other proteins or polypeptides that can be engineered as a fusion protein with an anti CD19 antibody include but are not limited to toxins such as ricin abrin ribonuclease DNase I Staphylococcal enterotoxin A pokeweed anti viral protein gelonin diphtherin toxin exotoxin and endotoxin. See for example Pastan et al. 47 641 1986 and Goldenberg et al. 44 43 1994 . Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof which can be used include diphtheria A chain non binding active fragments of diphtheria toxin exotoxin A chain from ricin A chain abrin A chain modeccin A chain alpha sarcin proteins dianthin proteins proteins PAPI PAPII and PAP S inhibitor curcin crotin sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor gelonin mitogellin restrictocin phenomycin enomycin and the tricothecenes. See for example WO 93 21232 published Oct. 28 1993.

Additional fusion proteins may be generated through the techniques of gene shuffling motif shuffling exon shuffling and or codon shuffling collectively referred to as DNA shuffling . DNA shuffling may be employed to alter the activities of SYNAGIS antibodies or fragments thereof e.g. an antibody or a fragment thereof with higher affinities and lower dissociation rates . See generally U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 605 793 5 811 238 5 830 721 5 834 252 and 5 837 458 and Patten et al. 19978 724 33 Harayama 1998 16 2 76 82 Hansson et al. 1999287 265 76 and Lorenzo and Blasco 199824 2 308 313 each of these patents and publications are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety . The antibody can further be a binding domain immunoglobulin fusion protein as described in U.S. Publication 20030118592 U.S. Publication 200330133939 and PCT Publication WO 02 056910 all to Ledbetter et al. which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.

In certain embodiments of the invention the anti CD19 antibodies can be modified to alter their isoelectric point pI . Antibodies like all polypeptides have a pI which is generally defined as the pH at which a polypeptide carries no net charge. It is known in the art that protein solubility is typically lowest when the pH of the solution is equal to the isoelectric point pI of the protein. As used herein the pI value is defined as the pI of the predominant charge form. The pI of a protein may be determined by a variety of methods including but not limited to isoelectric focusing and various computer algorithms see e.g. Bjellqvist et al. 199314 1023 . In addition the thermal melting temperatures Tm of the Fab domain of an antibody can be a good indicator of the thermal stability of an antibody and may further provide an indication of the shelf life. A lower Tm indicates more aggregation less stability whereas a higher Tm indicates less aggregation more stability. Thus in certain embodiments antibodies having higher Tm are preferable. Tm of a protein domain e.g. a Fab domain can be measured using any standard method known in the art for example by differential scanning calorimetry see e.g. Vermeer et al. 2000 Biophys. J. 78 394 404 Vermeer et al. 2000 Biophys. J. 79 2150 2154 .

Accordingly an additional nonexclusive embodiment of the present invention includes modified antibodies of the invention that have certain preferred biochemical characteristics such as a particular isoelectric point pI or melting temperature Tm .

More specifically in one embodiment the modified antibodies of the present invention have a pI ranging from 5.5 to 9.5. In still another specific embodiment the modified antibodies of the present invention have a pI that ranges from about 5.5 to about 6.0 or about 6.0 to about 6.5 or about 6.5 to about 7.0 or about 7.0 to about 7.5 or about 7.5 to about 8.0 or about 8.0 to about 8.5 or about 8.5 to about 9.0 or about 9.0 to about 9.5. In other specific embodiments the modified antibodies of the present invention have a pI that ranges from 5.5 6.0 or 6.0 to 6.5 or 6.5 to 7.0 or 7.0 7.5 or 7.5 8.0 or 8.0 8.5 or 8.5 9.0 or 9.0 9.5. Even more specifically the modified antibodies of the present invention have a pI of at least 5.5 or at least 6.0 or at least 6.3 or at least 6.5 or at least 6.7 or at least 6.9 or at least 7.1 or at least 7.3 or at least 7.5 or at least 7.7 or at least 7.9 or at least 8.1 or at least 8.3 or at least 8.5 or at least 8.7 or at least 8.9 or at least 9.1 or at least 9.3 or at least 9.5. In other specific embodiments the modified antibodies of the present invention have a pI of at least about 5.5 or at least about 6.0 or at least about 6.3 or at least about 6.5 or at least about 6.7 or at least about 6.9 or at least about 7.1 or at least about 7.3 or at least about 7.5 or at least about 7.7 or at least about 7.9 or at least about 8.1 or at least about 8.3 or at least about 8.5 or at least about 8.7 or at least about 8.9 or at least about 9.1 or at least about 9.3 or at least about 9.5.

It is possible to optimize solubility by altering the number and location of ionizable residues in the antibody to adjust the pI. For example the pI of a polypeptide can be manipulated by making the appropriate amino acid substitutions e.g. by substituting a charged amino acid such as a lysine for an uncharged residue such as alanine . Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory amino acid substitutions of an antibody that result in changes of the pI of said antibody may improve solubility and or the stability of the antibody. One skilled in the art would understand which amino acid substitutions would be most appropriate for a particular antibody to achieve a desired pI. In one embodiment a substitution is generated in an antibody of the invention to alter the pI. It is specifically contemplated that the substitution s of the Fc region that result in altered binding to Fc R described supra may also result in a change in the pI. In another embodiment substitution s of the Fc region are specifically chosen to effect both the desired alteration in Fc R binding and any desired change in pI.

In one embodiment the modified antibodies of the present invention have a Tm ranging from 65 C. to 120 C. In specific embodiments the modified antibodies of the present invention have a Tm ranging from about 75 C. to about 120 C. or about 75 C. to about 85 C. or about 85 C. to about 95 C. or about 95 C. to about 105 C. or about 105 C. to about 115 C. or about 115 C. to about 120 C. In other specific embodiments the modified antibodies of the present invention have a Tm ranging from 75 C. to 120 C. or 75 C. to 85 C. or 85 C. to 95 C. or 95 C. to 105 C. or 105 C. to 115 C. or 115 C. to 120 C. In still other specific embodiments the modified antibodies of the present invention have a Tm of at least about 65 C. or at least about 70 C. or at least about 75 C. or at least about 80 C. or at least about 85 C. or at least about 90 C. or at least about 95 C. or at least about 100 C. or at least about 105 C. or at least about 110 C. or at least about 115 C. or at least about 120 C. In yet other specific embodiments the modified antibodies of the present invention have a Tm of at least 65 C. or at least 70 C. or at least 75 C. or at least 80 C. or at least 85 C. or at least 90 C. or at least 95 C. or at least 100 C. or at least 105 C. or at least 110 C. or at least 115 C. or at least 120 C.

The anti CD19 antibodies of the compositions and methods of the invention can be domain antibodies e.g. antibodies containing the small functional binding units of antibodies corresponding to the variable regions of the heavy V or light V chains of human antibodies. Examples of domain antibodies include but are not limited to those available from Domantis Limited Cambridge UK and Domantis Inc. Cambridge Mass. USA that are specific to therapeutic targets see for example WO04 058821 WO04 003019 U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 291 158 6 582 915 6 696 245 and 6 593 081 . Commercially available libraries of domain antibodies can be used to identify anti CD19 domain antibodies. In certain embodiments the anti CD19 antibodies of the invention comprise a CD19 functional binding unit and a Fc gamma receptor functional binding unit.

The term diabodies refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen binding sites which fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain V connected to a light chain variable domain V in the same polypeptide chain V V . By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in for example EP 404 097 WO 93 11161 and Hollinger et al. 90 6444 6448 1993 .

In certain embodiments of the invention the anti CD19 antibodies are vaccibodies. Vaccibodies are dimeric polypeptides. Each monomer of a vaccibody consists of a scFv with specificity for a surface molecule on APC connected through a hinge region and a C domain to a second scFv. In other embodiments of the invention vaccibodies containing as one of the scFv s an anti CD19 antibody fragment may be used to juxtapose those B cells to be destroyed and an effector cell that mediates ADCC. For example see Bogen et al. U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20040253238.

In certain embodiments of the invention the anti CD19 antibodies are linear antibodies. Linear antibodies comprise a pair of tandem Fd segments V C V C which form a pair of antigen binding regions. Linear antibodies can be bispecific or monospecific. See Zapata et al. 8 10 1057 1062 1995 .

In certain embodiments of the invention the anti CD19 antibody is a parent antibody. A parent antibody is an antibody comprising an amino acid sequence which lacks or is deficient in one or more amino acid residues in or adjacent to one or more hypervariable regions thereof compared to an altered mutant antibody as herein disclosed. Thus the parent antibody has a shorter hypervariable region than the corresponding hypervariable region of an antibody mutant as herein disclosed. The parent polypeptide may comprise a native sequence i.e. a naturally occurring antibody including a naturally occurring allelic variant or an antibody with pre existing amino acid sequence modifications such as other insertions deletions and or substitutions of a naturally occurring sequence. Preferably the parent antibody is a humanized antibody or a human antibody.

 Antibody fragments comprise a portion of a full length antibody generally the antigen binding or variable region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab Fab F ab and Fv fragments diabodies linear antibodies single chain antibody molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.

Traditionally these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies see e.g. Morimoto et al. 24 107 117 1992 and Brennan et al. 229 81 1985 . However these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells. For example the antibody fragments can be isolated from the antibody phage libraries discussed above. Alternatively Fab SH fragments can be directly recovered from and chemically coupled to form F ab fragments Carter et al. 10 163 167 1992 . According to another approach F ab fragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner. In other embodiments the antibody of choice is a single chain Fv fragment scFv . See for example WO 93 16185. In certain embodiments the antibody is not a Fab fragment.

Bispecific antibodies are antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different epitopes. Exemplary bispecific antibodies may bind to two different epitopes of the B cell surface marker. Other such antibodies may bind a first B cell marker and further bind a second B cell surface marker. Alternatively an anti B cell marker binding arm may be combined with an arm which binds to a triggering molecule on a leukocyte such as a T cell receptor molecule e.g. CD2 or CD3 or Fc receptors for IgG Fc R so as to focus cellular defense mechanisms to the B cell. Bispecific antibodies may also be used to localize cytotoxic agents to the B cell. These antibodies possess a B cell marker binding arm and an arm which binds the cytotoxic agent e.g. saporin anti interferon vinca alkaloid ricin A chain methola exate or radioactive isotope hapten . Bispecific antibodies can be prepared as full length antibodies or antibody fragments e.g. F ab bispecific antibodies .

Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. See for example Millstein et al. 305 537 539 1983 Traunecker et al. 10 3655 3659 1991 Suresh et al. 121 210 1986 Kostelny et al. 148 5 1547 1553 1992 Hollinger et al. 90 6444 6448 1993 Gruber et al. 152 5368 1994 U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 474 893 4 714 681 4 925 648 5 573 920 5 601 81 95 731 168 4 676 980 and 4 676 980 WO 94 04690 WO 91 00360 WO 92 200373 WO 93 17715 WO 92 08802 and EP 03089 .

In certain embodiments of the invention the compositions and methods do not comprise a bispecific murine antibody with specificity for human CD19 and the CD3 epsilon chain of the T cell receptor such as the bispecific antibody described by Daniel et al. 92 4750 4757 1998 . In preferred embodiments where the anti CD19 antibody of the compositions and methods of the invention is bispecific the anti CD19 antibody is human or humanized and has specificity for human CD19 and an epitope on a T cell or is capable of binding to a human effector cell such as for example a monocyte macrophage and or a natural killer cell to effect cell death.

It may be desirable to modify the anti CD19 antibody of the invention with respect to effector function so as to enhance the effectiveness of the antibody in treating B cell malignancies an autoimmune disease or disorder or a GVHD or rejection for example. For example cysteine residue s may be introduced in the Fc region thereby allowing interchain disulfide bond formation in this region. The homodimeric antibody thus generated may have improved internalization capability and or increased complement mediated cell killing and or antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ADCC . See Caron et al. 176 1191 1195 1992 and Shopes B. 148 2918 2922 1992 . Homodimeric antibodies with enhanced anti tumor activity may also be prepared using heterobifunctional cross linkers as described in Wolff et al. 53 2560 2565 1993 . Alternatively an antibody can be engineered which has dual Fc regions and may thereby have enhanced complement lysis and ADCC capabilities. See Stevenson et al. 3 219 230 1989 .

Other methods of engineering Fc regions of antibodies so as to alter effector functions are known in the art e.g. U.S. Patent Publication No. 20040185045 and PCT Publication No. WO 2004 016750 both to Koenig et al. which describe altering the Fc region to enhance the binding affinity for Fc RIIB as compared with the binding affinity for FC RIIA see also PCT Publication Nos. WO 99 58572 to Armour et al. WO 99 51642 to Idusogie et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 6 395 272 to Deo et al. the disclosures of which are incorporated herein in their entireties . Methods of modifying the Fc region to decrease binding affinity to Fc RIIB are also known in the art e.g. U.S. Patent Publication No. 20010036459 and PCT Publication No. WO 01 79299 both to Ravetch et al. the disclosures of which are incorporated herein in their entireties . Modified antibodies having variant Fc regions with enhanced binding affinity for Fc RIIIA and or Fc RIIA as compared with a wild type Fc region have also been described e.g. PCT Publication Nos. WO 2004 063351 to Stavenhagen et al. the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety .

In vitro assays known in the art can be used to determine whether the anti CD19 antibodies used in the compositions and methods of the invention are capable of mediating ADCC such as those described herein.

The present invention provides formulation of proteins comprising a variant Fc region. That is a non naturally occurring Fc region for example an Fc region comprising one or more non naturally occurring amino acid residues. Also encompassed by the variant Fc regions of the present invention are Fc regions which comprise amino acid deletions additions and or modifications.

It will be understood that Fc region as used herein includes the polypeptides comprising the constant region of an antibody excluding the first constant region immunoglobulin domain. Thus Fc refers to the last two constant region immunoglobulin domains of IgA IgD and IgG and the last three constant region immunoglobulin domains of IgE and IgM and the flexible hinge N terminal to these domains. For IgA and IgM Fc may include the J chain. For IgG Fc comprises immunoglobulin domains Cgamma2 and Cgamma3 C and C and the hinge between Cgamma1 C 1 and Cgamma2 C . Although the boundaries of the Fc region may vary the human IgG heavy chain Fc region is usually defined to comprise residues C226 or P230 to its carboxyl terminus wherein the numbering is according to the EU index as in Kabat et al. 1991 NIH Publication 91 3242 National Technical Information Service Springfield Va. . The EU index as set forth in Kabat refers to the residue numbering of the human IgG1 EU antibody as described in Kabat et al. supra. Fc may refer to this region in isolation or this region in the context of an antibody antibody fragment or Fc fusion protein. An Fc variant protein may be an antibody Fc fusion or any protein or protein domain that comprises an Fc region. Particularly preferred are proteins comprising variant Fc regions which are non naturally occurring variants of an Fc. Note Polymorphisms have been observed at a number of Fc positions including but not limited to Kabat 270 272 312 315 356 and 358 and thus slight differences between the presented sequence and sequences in the prior art may exist.

The present invention encompasses Fc variant proteins which have altered binding properties for an Fc ligand e.g. an Fc receptor C1q relative to a comparable molecule e.g. a protein having the same amino acid sequence except having a wild type Fc region . Examples of binding properties include but are not limited to binding specificity equilibrium dissociation constant K dissociation and association rates Kand Krespectively binding affinity and or avidity. It is generally understood that a binding molecule e.g. a Fc variant protein such as an antibody with a low Kis preferable to a binding molecule with a high K. However in some instances the value of the Kor Kmay be more relevant than the value of the K. One skilled in the art can determine which kinetic parameter is most important for a given antibody application.

The affinities and binding properties of an Fc domain for its ligand may be determined by a variety of in vitro assay methods biochemical or immunological based assays known in the art for determining Fc Fc R interactions i.e. specific binding of an Fc region to an Fc R including but not limited to equilibrium methods e.g. enzyme linked immunoabsorbent assay ELISA or radioimmunoassay RIA or kinetics e.g. BIACORE analysis and other methods such as indirect binding assays competitive inhibition assays fluorescence resonance energy transfer FRET gel electrophoresis and chromatography e.g. gel filtration . These and other methods may utilize a label on one or more of the components being examined and or employ a variety of detection methods including but not limited to chromogenic fluorescent luminescent or isotopic labels. A detailed description of binding affinities and kinetics can be found in Paul W. E. ed. Fundamental Immunology 4th Ed. Lippincott Raven Philadelphia 1999 which focuses on antibody immunogen interactions.

For example a modification that enhances Fc binding to one or more positive regulators e.g. Fc RIIIA while leaving unchanged or even reducing Fc binding to the negative regulator Fc RIIB would be more preferable for enhancing ADCC activity. Alternatively a modification that reduced binding to one or more positive regulator and or enhanced binding to Fc RIIB would be preferable for reducing ADCC activity. Accordingly the ratio of binding affinities e.g. equilibrium dissociation constants K can indicate if the ADCC activity of an Fc variant is enhanced or decreased. For example a decrease in the ratio of Fc RIIIA Fc RIIB equilibrium dissociation constants K will correlate with improved ADCC activity while an increase in the ratio will correlate with a decrease in ADCC activity. Additionally modifications that enhanced binding to C1q would be preferable for enhancing CDC activity while modification that reduced binding to C1q would be preferable for reducing or eliminating CDC activity.

In one embodiment the Fc variants of the invention bind Fc RIIIA with increased affinity relative to a comparable molecule. In another embodiment the Fc variants of the invention bind Fc RIIIA with increased affinity and bind Fc RIIB with a binding affinity that is unchanged relative to a comparable molecule. In still another embodiment the Fc variants of the invention bind Fc RIIIA with increased affinity and bind Fc RIIB with a decreased affinity relative to a comparable molecule. In yet another embodiment the Fc variants of the invention have a ratio of Fc RIIIA Fc RIIB equilibrium dissociation constants K that is decreased relative to a comparable molecule.

In a specific embodiment the Fc variant protein has enhanced binding to an Fc receptor. In another specific embodiment the Fc variant protein has enhanced binding to the Fc receptor Fc RIIIA. In still another specific embodiment the Fc variant protein has enhanced binding to the Fc receptor FcRn. In yet another specific embodiment the Fc variant protein has enhanced binding to C1q relative to a comparable molecule.

In one embodiment of the present invention antibodies specifically bind CD19 and antigenic fragments thereof with a dissociation constant or K k k of less than 10M or of less than 10M or of less than 10M or of less than 10M or of less than 10M or of less than 10M or of less than 10M or of less than 10M or of less than 10M.

In another embodiment the antibody of the invention binds to CD19 and or antigenic fragments thereof with a Kof less than 1 10s or less than 3 10s. In other embodiments the antibody binds to CD19 and antigenic fragments thereof with a Kof less than 10s less than 5 10s less than 10s less than 5 10s less than 10s less than 5 10s less than 10s less than 5 10s less than 10s less than 5 10s less than 10s less than 5 10s less than 10s less than 5 10s or less than 10 s.

In another embodiment the antibody of the invention binds to CD19 and or antigenic fragments thereof with an association rate constant or krate of at least 10Ms at least 5 10Ms at least 10Ms at least 5 10Msat least 10Ms at least 5 10Ms or at least 10Ms or at least 10Ms.

In another embodiment an Fc variant of the invention has an equilibrium dissociation constant K that is decreased between about 2 fold and about 10 fold or between about 5 fold and about 50 fold or between about 25 fold and about 250 fold or between about 100 fold and about 500 fold or between about 250 fold and about 1000 fold relative to a comparable molecule. In another embodiment an Fc variant of the invention has an equilibrium dissociation constant K that is decreased between 2 fold and 10 fold or between 5 fold and 50 fold or between 25 fold and 250 fold or between 100 fold and 500 fold or between 250 fold and 1000 fold relative to a comparable molecule. In a specific embodiment said Fc variants have an equilibrium dissociation constants K for Fc RIIIA that is reduced by at least 2 fold or at least 3 fold or at least 5 fold or at least 7 fold or a least 10 fold or at least 20 fold or at least 30 fold or at least 40 fold or at least 50 fold or at least 60 fold or at least 70 fold or at least 80 fold or at least 90 fold or at least 100 fold or at least 200 fold or at least 400 fold or at least 600 fold relative to a comparable molecule.

The serum half life of proteins comprising Fc regions may be increased by increasing the binding affinity of the Fc region for FcRn. In one embodiment the Fc variant protein has enhanced serum half life relative to comparable molecule.

 Antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity or ADCC refers to a form of cytotoxicity in which secreted Ig bound onto Fc receptors FcRs present on certain cytotoxic cells e.g. Natural Killer NK cells neutrophils and macrophages enables these cytotoxic effector cells to bind specifically to an antigen bearing target cell and subsequently kill the target cell with cytotoxins. Specific high affinity IgG antibodies directed to the surface of target cells arm the cytotoxic cells and are absolutely required for such killing. Lysis of the target cell is extracellular requires direct cell to cell contact and does not involve complement. It is contemplated that in addition to antibodies other proteins comprising Fc regions specifically Fc fusion proteins having the capacity to bind specifically to an antigen bearing target cell will be able to effect cell mediated cytotoxicity. For simplicity the cell mediated cytotoxicity resulting from the activity of an Fc fusion protein is also referred to herein as ADCC activity.

The ability of any particular Fc variant protein to mediate lysis of the target cell by ADCC can be assayed. To assess ADCC activity an Fc variant protein of interest is added to target cells in combination with immune effector cells which may be activated by the antigen antibody complexes resulting in cytolysis of the target cell. Cytolysis is generally detected by the release of label e.g. radioactive substrates fluorescent dyes or natural intracellular proteins from the lysed cells. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC and Natural Killer NK cells. Specific examples of in vitro ADCC assays are described in Wisecarver et al. 1985 79 277 282 Bruggemann et al. 1987 J Exp Med 166 1351 1361 Wilkinson et al. 2001 J Immunol Methods 258 183 191 Patel et al. 1995184 29 38. Alternatively or additionally ADCC activity of the Fc variant protein of interest may be assessed in vivo e.g. in an animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. 1998 PNAS USA 95 652 656.

In one embodiment an Fc variant protein has enhanced ADCC activity relative to a comparable molecule. In a specific embodiment an Fc variant protein has ADCC activity that is at least 2 fold or at least 3 fold or at least 5 fold or at least 10 fold or at least 50 fold or at least 100 fold greater than that of a comparable molecule. In another specific embodiment an Fc variant protein has enhanced binding to the Fc receptor Fc RIIIA and has enhanced ADCC activity relative to a comparable molecule. In other embodiments the Fc variant protein has both enhanced ADCC activity and enhanced serum half life relative to a comparable molecule.

 Complement dependent cytotoxicity and CDC refer to the lysing of a target cell in the presence of complement. The complement activation pathway is initiated by the binding of the first component of the complement system C1q to a molecule an antibody for example complexed with a cognate antigen. To assess complement activation a CDC assay e.g. as described in Gazzano Santoro et al. 1996 J. Immunol. Methods 202 163 may be performed. In one embodiment an Fc variant protein has enhanced CDC activity relative to a comparable molecule. In a specific embodiment an Fc variant protein has CDC activity that is at least 2 fold or at least 3 fold or at least 5 fold or at least 10 fold or at least 50 fold or at least 100 fold greater than that of a comparable molecule. In other embodiments the Fc variant protein has both enhanced CDC activity and enhanced serum half life relative to a comparable molecule.

In one embodiment the present invention provides formulations wherein the Fc region comprises a non naturally occurring amino acid residue at one or more positions selected from the group consisting of 234 235 236 239 240 241 243 244 245 247 252 254 256 262 263 264 265 266 267 269 296 297 298 299 313 325 326 327 328 329 330 332 333 and 334 as numbered by the EU index as set forth in Kabat.

In one embodiment the Fc variants of the present invention may be combined with other known Fc variants such as those disclosed in Ghetie et al. 1997 Nat. Biotech. 15 637 40 Duncan et al 1988 Nature 332 563 564 Lund et al. 1991 J. Immunol. 147 2657 2662 Lund et al 1992 Mol.

Also encompassed by the present invention are Fc regions which comprise deletions additions and or modifications. Still other modifications substitutions additions deletions of the Fc domain will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art.

Methods for generating non naturally occurring Fc regions are known in the art. For example amino acid substitutions and or deletions can be generated by mutagenesis methods including but not limited to site directed mutagenesis Kunkel Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82 488 492 1985 PCR mutagenesis Higuchi in PCR Protocols A Guide to Methods and Applications Academic Press San Diego pp. 177 183 1990 and cassette mutagenesis Wells et al. Gene 34 315 323 1985 . Preferably site directed mutagenesis is performed by the overlap extension PCR method Higuchi in PCR Technology Principles and Applications for DNA Amplification Stockton Press New York pp. 61 70 1989 . Alternatively the technique of overlap extension PCR Higuchi ibid. can be used to introduce any desired mutation s into a target sequence the starting DNA . For example the first round of PCR in the overlap extension method involves amplifying the target sequence with an outside primer primer 1 and an internal mutagenesis primer primer 3 and separately with a second outside primer primer 4 and an internal primer primer 2 yielding two PCR segments segments A and B . The internal mutagenesis primer primer 3 is designed to contain mismatches to the target sequence specifying the desired mutation s . In the second round of PCR the products of the first round of PCR segments A and B are amplified by PCR using the two outside primers primers 1 and 4 . The resulting full length PCR segment segment C is digested with restriction enzymes and the resulting restriction fragment is cloned into an appropriate vector. As the first step of mutagenesis the starting DNA e.g. encoding an Fc fusion protein an antibody or simply an Fc region is operably cloned into a mutagenesis vector. The primers are designed to reflect the desired amino acid substitution. Other methods useful for the generation of variant Fc regions are known in the art see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 624 821 5 885 573 5 677 425 6 165 745 6 277 375 5 869 046 6 121 022 5 624 821 5 648 260 6 528 624 6 194 551 6 737 056 6 821 505 6 277 375 U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2004 0002587 and PCT Publications WO 94 29351 WO 99 58572 WO 00 42072 WO 02 060919 WO 04 029207 WO 04 099249 WO 04 063351 .

In some embodiments an Fc variant protein comprises one or more engineered glycoforms i.e. a carbohydrate composition that is covalently attached to the molecule comprising an Fc region. Engineered glycoforms may be useful for a variety of purposes including but not limited to enhancing or reducing effector function. Engineered glycoforms may be generated by any method known to one skilled in the art for example by using engineered or variant expression strains by co expression with one or more enzymes for example DI N acetylglucosaminyltransferase III GnTI11 by expressing a molecule comprising an Fc region in various organisms or cell lines from various organisms or by modifying carbohydrate s after the molecule comprising Fc region has been expressed. Methods for generating engineered glycoforms are known in the art and include but are not limited to those described in Umana et al. 1999 Nat. Biotechnol. 17 176 180 Davies et al. 20017 Biotechnol Bioeng. 74 288 294 Shields et al. 2002 J Biol. Chem. 277 26733 26740 Shinkawa et al. 2003 J Biol. Chem. 278 3466 3473 U.S. Pat. No. 6 602 684 U.S. Ser. No. 10 277 370 U.S. Ser. No. 10 113 929 PCT WO 00 61739A1 PCT WO 01 292246A1 PCT WO 02 311140A1 PCT WO 02 30954A1 Potillegent technology Biowa Inc. Princeton N.J. GlycoMAb glycosylation engineering technology GLYCART biotechnology AG Zurich Switzerland . See e.g. WO 00061739 EA01229125 US 20030115614 Okazaki et al. 2004 JMB 336 1239 49.

In still another embodiment the glycosylation of antibodies utilized in accordance with the invention is modified. For example an aglycosylated antibody can be made i.e. the antibody lacks glycosylation . Glycosylation can be altered to for example increase the affinity of the antibody for a target antigen. Such carbohydrate modifications can be accomplished by for example altering one or more sites of glycosylation within the antibody sequence. For example one or more amino acid substitutions can be made that result in elimination of one or more variable region framework glycosylation sites to thereby eliminate glycosylation at that site. Such aglycosylation may increase the affinity of the antibody for antigen. Such an approach is described in further detail in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 714 350 and 6 350 861. Alternatively one or more amino acid substitutions can be made that result in elimination of a glycosylation site present in the Fc region e.g. Asparagine 297 of IgG . Furthermore a glycosylated antibodies may be produced in bacterial cells which lack the necessary glycosylation machinery.

Additionally or alternatively an antibody can be made that has an altered type of glycosylation such as a hypofucosylated antibody having reduced amounts of fucosyl residues or an antibody having increased bisecting GlcNAc structures. Such altered glycosylation patterns have been demonstrated to increase the ADCC ability of antibodies. Such carbohydrate modifications can be accomplished by for example expressing the antibody in a host cell with altered glycosylation machinery. Cells with altered glycosylation machinery have been described in the art and can be used as host cells in which to express recombinant antibodies of the invention to thereby produce an antibody with altered glycosylation. See for example Shields R. L. et al. 2002 J. Biol. Chem. 277 26733 26740 Umana et al. 1999 Nat. Biotech. 17 176 1 as well as European Patent No EP 1 176 195 PCT Publications WO 03 035835 WO 99 54342. See also Li et al. 2006 Nat. Biotech 24 210 215 and published U.S. patent applications US2006 0040353 US2006 034830 US2006 0034829 US2006 0034828 US2006 0029604 and US2006 0024304 which describe altered glycosylation of antibodies.

Once a desired anti CD19 antibody is engineered the anti CD19 antibody can be produced on a commercial scale using methods that are well known in the art for large scale manufacturing of antibodies. For example this can be accomplished using recombinant expressing systems such as but not limited to those described below.

Recombinant expression of an antibody of the invention or variant thereof generally requires construction of an expression vector containing a polynucleotide that encodes the antibody. Once a polynucleotide encoding an antibody molecule or a heavy or light chain of an antibody or portion thereof preferably but not necessarily containing the heavy or light chain variable domain of the invention has been obtained the vector for the production of the antibody molecule may be produced by recombinant DNA technology using techniques well known in the art. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 331 415 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Thus methods for preparing a protein by expressing a polynucleotide containing an antibody encoding nucleotide sequence are described herein. Methods which are well known to those skilled in the art can be used to construct expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences and appropriate transcriptional and translational control signals. These methods include for example in vitro recombinant DNA techniques synthetic techniques and in vivo genetic recombination. The invention thus provides replicable vectors comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody molecule of the invention a heavy or light chain of an antibody a heavy or light chain variable domain of an antibody or a portion thereof or a heavy or light chain CDR operably linked to a promoter. Such vectors may include the nucleotide sequence encoding the constant region of the antibody molecule see e.g. International Publication Nos. WO 86 05807 and WO 89 01036 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 122 464 and the variable domain of the antibody may be cloned into such a vector for expression of the entire heavy the entire light chain or both the entire heavy and light chains.

In an alternate embodiment the anti CD19 antibodies of the compositions and methods of the invention can be made using targeted homologous recombination to produce all or portions of the anti CD19 antibodies see U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 063 630 6 187 305 and 6 692 737 . In certain embodiments the anti CD19 antibodies of the compositions and methods of the invention can be made using random recombination techniques to produce all or portions of the anti CD19 antibodies see U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 361 972 6 524 818 6 541 221 and 6 623 958 . Anti CD19 antibodies can also be produced in cells expressing an antibody from a genomic sequence of the cell comprising a modified immunoglobulin locus using Cre mediated site specific homologous recombination see U.S. Pat. No. 6 091 001 . Where human antibody production is desired the host cell should be a human cell line. These methods may advantageously be used to engineer stable cell lines which permanently express the antibody molecule.

Once the expression vector is transferred to a host cell by conventional techniques the transfected cells are then cultured by conventional techniques to produce an antibody of the invention. Thus the invention includes host cells containing a polynucleotide encoding an antibody of the invention or fragments thereof or a heavy or light chain thereof or portion thereof or a single chain antibody of the invention operably linked to a heterologous promoter. In preferred embodiments for the expression of double chained antibodies vectors encoding both the heavy and light chains may be co expressed in the host cell for expression of the entire immunoglobulin molecule as detailed below.

A variety of host expression vector systems may be utilized to express the anti CD19 antibodies of the invention or portions thereof that can be used in the engineering and generation of anti CD19 antibodies see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 807 715 . For example mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary cells CHO in conjunction with a vector such as the major intermediate early gene promoter element from human cytomegalovirus is an effective expression system for antibodies Foecking et al. 45 101 1986 and Cockett et al. 8 2 1990 . In addition a host cell strain may be chosen which modulates the expression of inserted antibody sequences or modifies and processes the antibody gene product in the specific fashion desired. Such modifications e.g. glycosylation and processing e.g. cleavage of protein products may be important for the function of the protein. Different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the post translational processing and modification of proteins and gene products. Appropriate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the antibody or portion thereof expressed. To this end eukaryotic host cells which possess the cellular machinery for proper processing of the primary transcript glycosylation and phosphorylation of the gene product may be used. Such mammalian host cells include but are not limited to CHO VERO BHK Hela COS MDCK 293 3T3 W138 BT483 Hs578T HTB2 BT2O and T47D NS0 a murine myeloma cell line that does not endogenously produce any immunoglobulin chains CRL7O3O and HsS78Bst cells.

In preferred embodiments human cell lines developed by immortalizing human lymphocytes can be used to recombinantly produce monoclonal human anti CD19 antibodies. In preferred embodiments the human cell line PER.C6. Crucell Netherlands can be used to recombinantly produce monoclonal human anti CD19 antibodies.

In bacterial systems a number of expression vectors may be advantageously selected depending upon the use intended for the antibody molecule being expressed. For example when a large quantity of such an antibody is to be produced for the generation of pharmaceutical compositions comprising an anti CD19 antibody vectors which direct the expression of high levels of fusion protein products that are readily purified may be desirable. Such vectors include but are not limited to the expression vector pUR278 Ruther et al. 12 1791 1983 in which the antibody coding sequence may be ligated individually into the vector in frame with the lac Z coding region so that a fusion protein is produced pIN vectors Inouye Inouye 198513 3101 3109 1985 Van Heeke Schuster 198924 5503 5509 1989 and the like. pGEX vectors may also be used to express foreign polypeptides as fusion proteins with glutathione 5 transferase GST . In general such fusion proteins are soluble and can easily be purified from lysed cells by adsorption and binding to matrix glutathione agarose beads followed by elution in the presence of free glutathione. The pGEX vectors are designed to include thrombin or factor Xa protease cleavage sites so that the cloned target gene product can be released from the GST moiety.

In an insect system nuclear polyhedrosis virus AcNPV is used as a vector to express foreign genes. The virus grows in cells. The antibody coding sequence may be cloned individually into non essential regions for example the polyhedrin gene of the virus and placed under control of an AcNPV promoter for example the polyhedrin promoter .

In mammalian host cells a number of viral based expression systems may be utilized. In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector the antibody coding sequence of interest may be ligated to an adenovirus transcription translation control complex e.g. the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence. This chimeric gene may then be inserted in the adenovirus genome by in vitro or in vivo recombination. Insertion in a non essential region of the viral genome e.g. region E1 or E3 will result in a recombinant virus that is viable and capable of expressing the antibody molecule in infected hosts e.g. see Logan Shenk 81 355 359 1984 . Specific initiation signals may also be required for efficient translation of inserted antibody coding sequences. These signals include the ATG initiation codon and adjacent sequences. Furthermore the initiation codon should generally be in phase with the reading frame of the desired coding sequence to ensure translation of the entire insert. These exogenous translational control signals and initiation codons can be of a variety of origins both natural and synthetic. The efficiency of expression may be enhanced by the inclusion of appropriate transcription enhancer elements transcription terminators etc. see e.g. Bittner et al. 153 51 544 1987 .

For long term high yield production of recombinant proteins stable expression is preferred. For example cell lines which stably express the antibody molecule may be engineered. Rather than transient expression systems that use replicating expression vectors which contain viral origins of replication host cells can be transformed with DNA controlled by appropriate expression control elements e.g. promoter enhancer sequences transcription terminators polyadenylation sites etc. and a selectable marker. Following the introduction of the foreign DNA engineered cells may be allowed to grow for 1 2 days in an enriched media and then are switched to a selective media. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines. Plasmids that encode the anti CD19 antibody can be used to introduce the gene cDNA into any cell line suitable for production in culture. Alternatively plasmids called targeting vectors can be used to introduce expression control elements e.g. promoters enhancers etc. into appropriate chromosomal locations in the host cell to activate the endogenous gene for anti CD19 antibodies.

A number of selection systems may be used including but not limited to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase Wigler et al. 11 223 1977 hypoxanthineguanine phosphoribosyltransferase Szybalska Szybalski 48 202 1992 and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase Lowy et al. 22 8 17 1980 genes can be employed in tk hgprt or aprT cells respectively. Also antimetabolite resistance can be used as the basis of selection for the following genes dhfr which confers resistance to methotrexate Wigler et al. 77 357 1980 O Hare et al. 78 1527 1981 gpt which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid Mulligan Berg 78 2072 1981 neo which confers resistance to the aminoglycoside G 418 Wu and Wu 3 87 95 1991 Tolstoshev 32 573 596 1993 Mulligan 260 926 932 1993 and Morgan and Anderson 62 191 217 1993 May TIB TECH 11 5 155 2 15 1993 and hygro which confers resistance to hygromycin Santerre et al. 30 147 1984 . Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology may be routinely applied to select the desired recombinant clone and such methods are described for example in Ausubel et al. eds. John Wiley Sons NY 1993 Kriegler Stockton Press NY 1990 and in Chapters 12 and 13 Dracopoli et al. eds. John Wiley Sons NY 1994 Colberre Garapin et al. 1981150 1 which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.

The expression levels of an antibody molecule can be increased by vector amplification for a review see Bebbington and Hentschel Vol. 3 Academic Press New York 1987 . When a marker in the vector system expressing antibody is amplifiable increase in the level of inhibitor present in culture of host cell will increase the number of copies of the marker gene. Since the amplified region is associated with the antibody gene production of the antibody will also increase Crouse et al. 3 257 1983 . Antibody expression levels may be amplified through the use recombinant methods and tools known to those skilled in the art of recombinant protein production including technologies that remodel surrounding chromatin and enhance transgene expression in the form of an active artificial transcriptional domain.

The host cell may be co transfected with two expression vectors of the invention the first vector encoding a heavy chain derived polypeptide and the second vector encoding a light chain derived polypeptide. The two vectors may contain identical selectable markers which enable equal expression of heavy and light chain polypeptides. Alternatively a single vector may be used which encodes and is capable of expressing both heavy and light chain polypeptides. In such situations the light chain should be placed before the heavy chain to avoid an excess of toxic free heavy chain Proudfoot 322 562 565 1986 and Kohler 198077 2197 2199 1980 . The coding sequences for the heavy and light chains may comprise cDNA or genomic DNA.

Once an antibody molecule of the invention has been produced by recombinant expression it may be purified by any method known in the art for purification of an immunoglobulin molecule for example by chromatography e.g. ion exchange affinity particularly by affinity for the specific antigen after Protein A and sizing column chromatography centrifugation differential solubility or by any other standard technique for the purification of proteins. Further the antibodies of the present invention or fragments thereof may be fused to heterologous polypeptide sequences described herein or otherwise known in the art to facilitate purification.

When using recombinant techniques the antibody can be produced intracellularly in the periplasmic space or directly secreted into the medium. If the antibody is produced intracellularly as a first step the particulate debris either host cells or lysed fragments is removed for example by centrifugation or ultrafiltration. Carter et al. 10 163 167 1992 describe a procedure for isolating antibodies which are secreted into the periplasmic space of . Briefly cell paste is thawed in the presence of sodium acetate pH 3.5 EDTA and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride PMSF over about 30 min. Cell debris can be removed by centrifugation. Where the antibody mutant is secreted into the medium supernatants from such expression systems are generally first concentrated using a commercially available protein concentration filter for example an Amicon or Millipore Pellicon ultrafiltration unit. A protease inhibitor such as PMSF may be included in any of the foregoing steps to inhibit proteolysis and antibiotics may be included to prevent the growth of adventitious contaminants.

The antibody composition prepared from the cells can be purified using for example hydroxylapatite chromatography hydrophobic interaction chromatography ion exchange chromatography gel electrophoresis dialysis and or affinity chromatography either alone or in combination with other purification steps. The suitability of protein A as an affinity ligand depends on the species and isotype of any immunoglobulin Fc domain that is present in the antibody mutant. Protein A can be used to purify antibodies that are based on human 1 2 or 4 heavy chains Lindmark et al. 62 1 13 1983 . Protein G is recommended for all mouse isotypes and for human 3 Guss et al. 5 15671575 1986 . The matrix to which the affinity ligand is attached is most often agarose but other matrices are available. Mechanically stable matrices such as controlled pore glass or poly styrenedivinyl benzene allow for faster flow rates and shorter processing times than can be achieved with agarose. Where the antibody comprises a CHdomain the Bakerbond ABX resin J. T. Baker Phillipsburg N.J. is useful for purification. Other techniques for protein purification such as fractionation on an ion exchange column ethanol precipitation Reverse Phase HPLC chromatography on silica chromatography on heparin SEPHAROSE chromatography on an anion or cation exchange resin such as a polyaspartic acid column chromatofocusing SDS PAGE and ammonium sulfate precipitation are also available depending on the antibody to be recovered.

Following any preliminary purification step s the mixture comprising the antibody of interest and contaminants may be subjected to low pH hydrophobic interaction chromatography using an elution buffer at a pH between about 2.5 4.5 preferably performed at low salt concentrations e.g. from about 0 0.25 M salt .

In certain embodiments the anti CD19 antibody of the invention comprises the heavy chain of HB12a comprising an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 2 . In other embodiments the anti CD19 antibody of the invention comprises the heavy chain of HB12b comprising an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 4 .

In certain embodiments the anti CD19 antibody of the invention comprises the light chain of HB12a comprising an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 16 . In other embodiments the anti CD19 antibody of the invention comprises the light chain of HB12b comprising an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 18 .

In certain embodiments the antibody is an isotype switched variant of a known antibody e.g. to an IgG1 or IgG3 human isotype such as those described above e.g. HB12a or HB12b .

The anti CD19 antibodies used in the compositions and methods of the invention can be naked antibodies immunoconjugates or fusion proteins. Preferably the anti CD19 antibodies described above for use in the compositions and methods of the invention are able to reduce or deplete B cells and circulating immunoglobulin in a human treated therewith. Depletion of B cells can be in circulating B cells or in particular tissues such as but not limited to bone marrow spleen gut associated lymphoid tissues and or lymph nodes. Such depletion may be achieved via various mechanisms such as antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ADCC and or complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC inhibition of B cell proliferation and or induction of B cell death e.g. via apoptosis . By depletion of B cells it is meant a reduction in circulating B cells and or B cells in particular tissue s by at least about 25 40 50 65 75 80 85 90 95 or more as described herein. In particular embodiments virtually all detectable B cells are depleted from the circulation and or particular tissue s . By depletion of circulating immunoglobulin Ig it is meant a reduction by at least about 25 40 50 65 75 80 85 90 95 or more as described herein. In particular embodiments virtually all detectable Ig is depleted from the circulation.

Binding assays can be used to identify antibodies that bind the human CD19 antigen. Binding assays may be performed either as direct binding assays or as competition binding assays. Binding can be detected using standard ELISA or standard Flow Cytometry assays. In a direct binding assay a candidate antibody is tested for binding to human CD19 antigen. In certain embodiments the screening assays comprise in a second step determining the ability to cause cell death or apoptosis of B cells expressing human CD19. Competition binding assays on the other hand assess the ability of a candidate antibody to compete with a known anti CD19 antibody or other compound that binds human CD19.

In a direct binding assay the human CD19 antigen is contacted with a candidate antibody under conditions that allow binding of the candidate antibody to the human CD19 antigen. The binding may take place in solution or on a solid surface. Preferably the candidate antibody is previously labeled for detection. Any detectable compound may be used for labeling such as but not limited to a luminescent fluorescent or radioactive isotope or group containing same or a nonisotopic label such as an enzyme or dye. After a period of incubation sufficient for binding to take place the reaction is exposed to conditions and manipulations that remove excess or non specifically bound antibody. Typically it involves washing with an appropriate buffer. Finally the presence of a CD19 antibody complex is detected.

In a competition binding assay a candidate antibody is evaluated for its ability to inhibit or displace the binding of a known anti CD19 antibody or other compound to the human CD19 antigen. A labeled known binder of CD19 may be mixed with the candidate antibody and placed under conditions in which the interaction between them would normally occur with and without the addition of the candidate antibody. The amount of labeled known binder of CD19 that binds the human CD19 may be compared to the amount bound in the presence or absence of the candidate antibody.

In a preferred embodiment to facilitate antibody antigen complex formation and detection the binding assay is carried out with one or more components immobilized on a solid surface. In various embodiments the solid support could be but is not restricted to polycarbonate polystyrene polypropylene polyethylene glass nitrocellulose dextran nylon polyacrylamide and agarose. The support configuration can include beads membranes microparticles the interior surface of a reaction vessel such as a microtiter plate test tube or other reaction vessel. The immobilization of human CD19 or other component can be achieved through covalent or non covalent attachments. In one embodiment the attachment may be indirect i.e. through an attached antibody. In another embodiment the human CD19 antigen and negative controls are tagged with an epitope such as glutathione S transferase GST so that the attachment to the solid surface can be mediated by a commercially available antibody such as anti GST Santa Cruz Biotechnology .

For example such an affinity binding assay may be performed using the human CD19 antigen which is immobilized to a solid support. Typically the non mobilized component of the binding reaction in this case the candidate anti CD19 antibody is labeled to enable detection. A variety of labeling methods are available and may be used such as luminescent chromophore fluorescent or radioactive isotope or group containing same and nonisotopic labels such as enzymes or dyes. In a preferred embodiment the candidate anti CD19 antibody is labeled with a fluorophore such as fluorescein isothiocyanate FITC available from Sigma Chemicals St. Louis .

Finally the label remaining on the solid surface may be detected by any detection method known in the art. For example if the candidate anti CD19 antibody is labeled with a fluorophore a fluorimeter may be used to detect complexes.

Preferably the human CD19 antigen is added to binding assays in the form of intact cells that express human CD19 antigen or isolated membranes containing human CD19 antigen. Thus direct binding to human CD19 antigen may be assayed in intact cells in culture or in animal models in the presence and absence of the candidate anti CD19 antibody. A labeled candidate anti CD19 antibody may be mixed with cells that express human CD19 antigen or with crude extracts obtained from such cells and the candidate anti CD19 antibody may be added. Isolated membranes may be used to identify candidate anti CD19 antibodies that interact with human CD19. For example in a typical experiment using isolated membranes cells may be genetically engineered to express human CD19 antigen. Membranes can be harvested by standard techniques and used in an in vitro binding assay. Labeled candidate anti CD19 antibody e.g. fluorescent labeled antibody is bound to the membranes and assayed for specific activity specific binding is determined by comparison with binding assays performed in the presence of excess unlabeled cold candidate anti CD19 antibody. Alternatively soluble human CD19 antigen may be recombinantly expressed and utilized in non cell based assays to identify antibodies that bind to human CD19 antigen. The recombinantly expressed human CD19 polypeptides can be used in the non cell based screening assays. Alternatively peptides corresponding to one or more of the binding portions of human CD19 antigen or fusion proteins containing one or more of the binding portions of human CD19 antigen can be used in non cell based assay systems to identify antibodies that bind to portions of human CD19 antigen. In non cell based assays the recombinantly expressed human CD19 is attached to a solid substrate such as a test tube microtiter well or a column by means well known to those in the art see Ausubel et al. supra . The test antibodies are then assayed for their ability to bind to human CD19 antigen.

Alternatively the binding reaction may be carried out in solution. In this assay the labeled component is allowed to interact with its binding partner s in solution. If the size differences between the labeled component and its binding partner s permit such a separation the separation can be achieved by passing the products of the binding reaction through an ultrafilter whose pores allow passage of unbound labeled component but not of its binding partner s or of labeled component bound to its partner s . Separation can also be achieved using any reagent capable of capturing a binding partner of the labeled component from solution such as an antibody against the binding partner and so on.

In one embodiment for example a phage library can be screened by passing phage from a continuous phage display library through a column containing purified human CD19 antigen or derivative analog fragment or domain thereof linked to a solid phase such as plastic beads. By altering the stringency of the washing buffer it is possible to enrich for phage that express peptides with high affinity for human CD19 antigen. Phage isolated from the column can be cloned and affinities can be measured directly. Knowing which antibodies and their amino acid sequences confer the strongest binding to human CD19 antigen computer models can be used to identify the molecular contacts between CD19 antigen and the candidate antibody.

In another specific embodiment of this aspect of the invention the solid support is membrane containing human CD19 antigen attached to a microtiter dish. Candidate antibodies for example can bind cells that express library antibodies cultivated under conditions that allow expression of the library members in the microtiter dish. Library members that bind to the human CD19 are harvested. Such methods are generally described by way of example in Parmley and Smith 198873 305 318 Fowlkes et al. 199213 422 427 PCT Publication No. WO94 18318 and in references cited hereinabove. Antibodies identified as binding to human CD19 antigen can be of any of the types or modifications of antibodies described above.

In certain embodiments the screening assays comprise in a second step determining the ability to cause cell death or apoptosis of B cells expressing human CD19. Assays utilizing viable dyes methods of detecting and analyzing caspases and assays measuring DNA breaks can be used to assess the apoptotic activity of cells cultured in vitro with an anti CD19 antibody of interest. For example Annexin V or TdT mediated dUTP nick end labeling TUNEL assays can be carried out as described in Decker et al. 103 2718 2725 2004 to detect apoptotic activity. The TUNEL assay involves culturing the cells of interest with fluorescein labeled dUTP for incorporation into DNA strand breaks. The cells are then processed for analysis by flow cytometry. The Annexin V assay detects the exposure of phosphatidylserine PS on the outside of the plasma membrane using a fluorescein conjugated antibody that specifically recognizes the exposed PS on the surface of apoptotic cells. In conjunction a viable dye such as propidium iodide can be used to exclude late apoptotic cells from early apoptotic cells. The cells of interest are stained with the antibody and are analyzed by flow cytometry. Moreover techniques for assaying apoptotic activity of an antibody are well known in the art. See e.g. Chaouchi et al. 154 7 3096 104 1995 Pedersen et al. 99 4 1314 1318 2002 Alberts et al. Steensma et al. 85 323 32 2003 .

Antibodies of the human IgG class are preferred for use in the invention because they have functional characteristics such a long half life in serum and can mediate various effector functions Wiley Liss Inc. Chapter 1 1995 . The human IgG class antibody is further classified into the following 4 subclasses IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 and IgG4. A large number of studies have so far been conducted for ADCC and CDC and apoptotic activity as effector functions of the IgG class antibody and it has been reported that among antibodies of the human IgG class the IgG1 subclass has the highest ADCC activity and CDC activity in humans 65 88 1997 .

Expression of ADCC activity and CDC activity and apoptotic activity of the human IgG1 subclass antibodies generally involves binding of the Fc region of the antibody to a receptor for an antibody hereinafter referred to as Fc R existing on the surface of effector cells such as killer cells natural killer cells or activated macrophages. Various complement components can be bound. Regarding the binding it has been suggested that several amino acid residues in the hinge region and the second domain of C region hereinafter referred to as C domain of the antibody are important 23 1098 1993 86 319 1995 65 88 1997 and that a sugar chain in the C domain 65 88 1997 is also important.

The anti CD19 antibodies of the invention can be modified with respect to effector function e.g. so as to enhance ADCC and or complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC and or apoptotic activity of the antibody. This may be achieved by introducing one or more amino acid substitutions in the Fc region of an antibody. Alternatively or additionally cysteine residue s may be introduced in the Fc region allowing for interchain disulfide bond formation in this region. In this way a homodimeric antibody can be generated that may have improved internalization capability and or increased complement mediated cell killing and ADCC Caron et al. 176 1191 1195 1992 and Shopes 148 2918 2922 1992 . Heterobifunctional cross linkers can also be used to generate homodimeric antibodies with enhanced anti tumor activity Wolff et al. 53 2560 2565 1993 . Antibodies can also be engineered to have two or more Fc regions resulting in enhanced complement lysis and ADCC capabilities Stevenson et al. 3 219 230 1989 .

Other methods of engineering Fc regions of antibodies so as to alter effector functions are known in the art e.g. U.S. Patent Publication No. 20040185045 and PCT Publication No. WO 2004 016750 both to Koenig et al. which describe altering the Fc region to enhance the binding affinity for Fc RIIB as compared with the binding affinity for FC RIIA see also PCT Publication Nos. WO 99 58572 to Armour et al. WO 99 51642 to Idusogie et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 6 395 272 to Deo et al. the disclosures of which are incorporated herein in their entireties . Methods of modifying the Fc region to decrease binding affinity to Fc RIIB are also known in the art e.g. U.S. Patent Publication No. 20010036459 and PCT Publication No. WO 01 79299 both to Ravetch et al. the disclosures of which are incorporated herein in their entireties . Modified antibodies having variant Fc regions with enhanced binding affinity for Fc RIIIA and or Fc RIIA as compared with a wild type Fc region have also been described e.g. PCT Publication No. WO 2004 063351 to Stavenhagen et al. the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety .

At least four different types of Fc R have been found which are respectively called Fc RI CD64 Fc RII CD32 Fc RIII CD16 and Fc RIV. In human Fc RII and Fc RIII are further classified into Fc RIIa and Fc RIIb and Fc RIIIa and Fc RIIIb respectively. Fc R is a membrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily Fc RII Fc RIII and Fc RIV have an a chain having an extracellular region containing two immunoglobulin like domains Fc RI has an chain having an extracellular region containing three immunoglobulin like domains as a constituting component and the chain is involved in the IgG binding activity. In addition Fc RI and Fc RIII have a chain or chain as a constituting component which has a signal transduction function in association with the chain 18 709 2000 19 275 2001 . Fc RIV has been described by Bruhns et al. . Canada 27 3 D 2004 .

To assess ADCC activity of an anti CD19 antibody of interest an in vitro ADCC assay can be used such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 500 362 or 5 821 337. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC and Natural Killer NK cells. For example the ability of any particular antibody to mediate lysis of the target cell by complement activation and or ADCC can be assayed. The cells of interest are grown and labeled in vitro the antibody is added to the cell culture in combination with immune cells which may be activated by the antigen antibody complexes i.e. effector cells involved in the ADCC response. The antibody can also be tested for complement activation. In either case cytolysis of the target cells is detected by the release of label from the lysed cells. In fact antibodies can be screened using the patient s own serum as a source of complement and or immune cells. The antibodies that are capable of mediating human ADCC in the in vitro test can then be used therapeutically in that particular patient. Alternatively or additionally ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo e.g. in an animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. USA 95 652 656 1998 . Moreover techniques for modulating i.e. increasing or decreasing the level of ADCC and optionally CDC activity and optionally apoptotic activity of an antibody are well known in the art. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 194 551. see e.g. Chaouchi et al. J. Immunol. 154 7 3096 104 1995 Pedersen et al. Blood 99 4 1314 1318 2002 Alberts et al. Molecular Biology of the Cell Steensma et al. Methods Mol. Med. 85 323 32 2003 . Antibodies of the present invention preferably are capable or have been modified to have the ability of inducing ADCC and or CDC and or an apoptotic response. Preferably such assays to determined ADCC function are practiced using humans effector cells to assess human ADCC function.

According to certain aspects of the invention therapeutic agents or toxins can be conjugated to chimerized human or humanized anti CD19 antibodies for use in the compositions and methods of the invention. In certain embodiments these conjugates can be generated as fusion proteins. Examples of therapeutic agents and toxins include but are not limited to members of the enediyne family of molecules such as calicheamicin and esperamicin. Chemical toxins can also be taken from the group consisting of duocarmycin see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 703 080 and U.S. Pat. No. 4 923 990 methotrexate doxorubicin melphalan chlorambucil ARA C vindesine mitomycin C cis platinum etoposide bleomycin and 5 fluorouracil. Examples of chemotherapeutic agents also include adriamycin doxorubicin 5 fluorouracil cytosine arabinoside ara c cyclophosphamide thiotepa taxotere docetaxel busulfan cytoxin taxol methotrexate cisplatin melphalan vinblastine bleomycin etoposide ifosfamide mitomycin c mitoxantrone vincreistine vinorelbine carboplatin teniposide daunomycin caminomycin aminopterin dactinomycin mitomycins esperamicins see U.S. Pat. No. 4 675 187 melphalan and other related nitrogen mustards.

In other embodiments for example CVB 1.5 g mcyclophosphamide 200 400 mg metoposide and 150 200 mg mcarmustine can be used in the combination therapies of the invention. CVB is a regimen used to treat non Hodgkin s lymphoma Patti et al. 51 18 1993 . Other suitable combination chemotherapeutic regimens are well known to those of skill in the art. See for example Freedman et al. in Cancer Medicine Volume 2 3rd Edition Holland et al. eds. pp. 2028 2068 Lea Febiger 1993 . As an illustration first generation chemotherapeutic regimens for treatment of intermediate grade non Hodgkin s lymphoma include C MOPP cyclophosphamide vincristine procarbazine and prednisone and CHOP cyclophosphamide doxorubicin vincristine and prednisone . A useful second generation chemotherapeutic regimen is m BACOD methotrexate bleomycin doxorubicin cyclophosphamide vincristine dexamethasone and leucovorin while a suitable third generation regimen is MACOP B methotrexate doxorubicin cyclophosphamide vincristine prednisone bleomycin and leucovorin . Additional useful drugs include phenyl butyrate and brostatin 1.

Other toxins that can be used in the immunoconjugates of the invention include poisonous lectins plant toxins such as ricin abrin modeccin botulina and diphtheria toxins. Of course combinations of the various toxins could also be coupled to one antibody molecule thereby accommodating variable cytotoxicity. Illustrative of toxins which are suitably employed in the combination therapies of the invention are ricin abrin ribonuclease DNase I Staphylococcal enterotoxin A pokeweed anti viral protein gelonin diphtherin toxin exotoxin and endotoxin. See for example Pastan et al. Cell 47 641 1986 and Goldenberg et al. 44 43 1994 .

See for example WO 93 21232 published Oct. 28 1993.

Suitable toxins and chemotherapeutic agents are described in Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences 19th Ed. Mack Publishing Co. 1995 and in Goodman and Gilman s the Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics 7th Ed. MacMillan Publishing Co. 1985 . Other suitable toxins and or chemotherapeutic agents are known to those of skill in the art.

The anti CD19 antibody of the present invention may also be used in ADEPT by conjugating the antibody to a prodrug activating enzyme which converts a prodrug e.g. a peptidyl chemotherapeutic agent see WO81 01145 to an active anti cancer drug. See for example WO 88 07378 and U.S. Pat. No. 4 975 278. The enzyme component of the immunoconjugate useful for ADEPT includes any enzyme capable of acting on a prodrug in such a way so as to covert it into its more active cytotoxic form.

Enzymes that are useful in the method of this invention include but are not limited to alkaline phosphatase useful for converting phosphate containing prodrugs into free drugs arylsulfatase useful for converting sulfate containing prodrugs into free drugs cytosine deaminase useful for converting non toxic 5 fluorocytosine into the anti cancer drug 5 fluorouracil proteases such as protease thermolysin subtilisin carboxypeptidases and cathepsins such as cathepsins B and L that are useful for converting peptide containing prodrugs into free drugs D alanylcarboxypeptidases useful for converting prodrugs that contain D amino acid substituents carbohydrate cleaving enzymes such as galactosidase and neuraminidase useful for converting glycosylated prodrugs into free drugs lactamase useful for converting drugs derivatized with lactams into free drugs and penicillin amidases such as penicillin V amidase or penicillin G amidase useful for converting drugs derivatized at their amine nitrogens with phenoxyacetyl or phenylacetyl groups respectively into free drugs. Alternatively antibodies with enzymatic activity also known in the art as abzymes can be used to convert the prodrugs of the invention into free active drugs see e.g. Massey 328 457 458 1987 . Antibody abzyme conjugates can be prepared as described herein for delivery of the abzyme as desired to portions of a human affected by a B cell malignancy or an autoimmune disease or disorder.

The enzymes of this invention can be covalently bound to the antibody by techniques well known in the art such as the use of the heterobifunctional crosslinking reagents discussed above. Alternatively fusion proteins comprising at least the antigen binding region of an antibody of the invention linked to at least a functionally active portion of an enzyme of the invention can be constructed using recombinant DNA techniques well known in the art see e.g. Neuberger et al. 312 604 608 1984 .

Covalent modifications of the anti CD19 antibody of the invention are included within the scope of this invention. They may be made by chemical synthesis or by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of the antibody if applicable. Other types of covalent modifications of the anti CD19 antibody are introduced into the molecule by reacting targeted amino acid residues of the antibody with an organic derivatizing agent that is capable of reacting with selected side chains or the N or C terminal residues.

Cysteinyl residues most commonly are reacted with haloacetates and corresponding amines such as chloroacetic acid or chloroacetamide to give carboxymethyl or carboxyamidomethyl derivatives. Similarly iodo reagents may also be used. Cysteinyl residues also are derivatized by reaction with bromotrifluoroacetone bromo 5 imidozoyl propionic acid chloroacetyl phosphate N alkylmaleimides 3 nitro 2 pyridyl disulfide methyl 2 pyridyl disulfide p chloromercuribenzoate 2 chloromercuri 4 nitrophenol or chloro 7 nitrobenzo 2 oxa 1 3 diazole.

Histidyl residues are derivatized by reaction with diethylpyrocarbonate at pH 5.5 7.0 because this agent is relatively specific for the histidyl side chain. Para bromophenacyl bromide also is useful the reaction is preferably performed in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate at pH 6.0.

Lysyl and amino terminal residues are reacted with succinic or other carboxylic acid anhydrides. Derivatization with these agents has the effect of reversing the charge of the lysinyl residues. Other suitable reagents for derivatizing amino containing residues and or amino containing residues include imidoesters such as methyl picolinimidate pyridoxal phosphate pyridoxal chloroborohydride trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid 0 methylisourea 2 4 pentanedione and transaminase catalyzed reaction with glyoxylate.

Arginyl residues are modified by reaction with one or several conventional reagents among them phenylglyoxal 2 3 butanedione 1 2 cyclohexanedione and ninhydrin. Derivatization of arginyl residues generally requires that the reaction be performed in alkaline conditions because of the high pKa of the guanidine functional group. Furthermore these reagents may react with the amino groups of lysine as well as the arginine epsilon amino group.

The specific modification of tyrosyl residues may be made with particular interest in introducing spectral labels into tyrosyl residues by reaction with aromatic diazonium compounds or tetranitromethane. Most commonly N acetylimidizole and tetranitromethane are used to form O acetyl tyrosyl species and 3 nitro derivatives respectively. Tyrosyl residues are iodinated using I or I to prepare labeled proteins for use in radioimmunoassay.

Carboxyl side groups aspartyl or glutamyl are selectively modified by reaction with carbodiimides R N C N R where R and R are different alkyl groups such as 1 cyclohexyl 3 2 morpholinyl 4 ethyl carbodiimide or 1 ethyl 3 4 azonia 4 4 dimethylpentyl carbodiimide. Furthermore aspartyl and glutamyl residues are converted to asparaginyl and glutaminyl residues by reaction with ammonium ions.

Glutaminyl and asparaginyl residues are frequently deamidated to the corresponding glutamyl and aspartyl residues respectively. These residues are deamidated under neutral or basic conditions. The deamidated form of these residues falls within the scope of this invention.

Other modifications include hydroxylation of proline and lysine phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups of seryl or threonyl residues methylation of the amino groups of lysine arginine and histidine side chains T. E. Creighton W. H. Freeman Co. San Francisco pp. 79 86 1983 acetylation of the N terminal amine and amidation of any C terminal carboxyl group.

Another type of covalent modification involves chemically or enzymatically coupling glycosides to the antibody. These procedures are advantageous in that they do not require production of the antibody in a host cell that has glycosylation capabilities for N or O linked glycosylation. Depending on the coupling mode used the sugar s may be attached to a arginine and histidine b free carboxyl groups c free sulfhydryl groups such as those of cysteine d free hydroxyl groups such as those of serine threonine or hydroxyproline e aromatic residues such as those of phenylalanine tyrosine or tryptophan or f the amide group of glutamine. These methods are described in WO 87 05330 published 11 Sep. 1987 and in Aplin and Wriston CRC 259 306 1981 .

The pharmaceutical formulations of the invention contain as the active ingredient human humanized or chimeric anti CD19 antibodies. The formulations contain naked antibody immunoconjugate or fusion protein in an amount effective for producing the desired response in a unit of weight or volume suitable for administration to a human patient and are preferably sterile. The response can for example be measured by determining the physiological effects of the anti CD19 antibody composition such as but not limited to circulating B cell depletion tissue B cell depletion regression of a B cell malignancy or an autoimmune disease or disorder or decrease of disease symptoms. The response can also be measured by determining the physiological effects of the anti CD19 antibody composition such as circulating immunoglobulin depletion or a reduction in the incidence severity or duration of GVHD a rejection episode or a post transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder. Other assays will be known to one of ordinary skill in the art and can be employed for measuring the level of the response.

An anti CD19 antibody composition may be formulated with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The term pharmaceutically acceptable means one or more non toxic materials that do not interfere with the effectiveness of the biological activity of the active ingredients. Such preparations may routinely contain salts buffering agents preservatives compatible carriers and optionally other therapeutic agents. Such pharmaceutically acceptable preparations may also routinely contain compatible solid or liquid fillers diluents or encapsulating substances which are suitable for administration into a human. When used in medicine the salts should be pharmaceutically acceptable but non pharmaceutically acceptable salts may conveniently be used to prepare pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and are not excluded from the scope of the invention. Such pharmacologically and pharmaceutically acceptable salts include but are not limited to those prepared from the following acids hydrochloric hydrobromic sulfuric nitric phosphoric maleic acetic salicylic citric boric formic malonic succinic and the like. Also pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be prepared as alkaline metal or alkaline earth salts such as sodium potassium or calcium salts. The term carrier denotes an organic or inorganic ingredient natural or synthetic with which the active ingredient is combined to facilitate the application. The components of the pharmaceutical compositions also are capable of being co mingled with the antibodies of the present invention and with each other in a manner such that there is no interaction which would substantially impair the desired pharmaceutical efficacy.

According to certain aspects of the invention the anti CD19 antibody compositions can be prepared for storage by mixing the antibody or immunoconjugate having the desired degree of purity with optional physiologically acceptable carriers excipients or stabilizers 16th edition Osol A. Ed. 1999 in the form of lyophilized formulations or aqueous solutions. Acceptable carriers excipients or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed and include buffers such as phosphate citrate and other organic acids antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine preservatives such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride hexamethonium chloride benzalkonium chloride benzethonium chloride phenol butyl or benzyl alcohol alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben catechol resorcinol cyclohexanol 3 pentanol and m cresol low molecular weight less than about 10 residues polypeptide proteins such as serum albumin gelatin or immunoglobulins hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrolidone amino acids such as glycine glutamine asparagine histidine arginine or lysine monosaccharides disaccharides and other carbohydrates including glucose mannose or dextrins chelating agents such as EDTA sugars such as sucrose mannitol trehalose or sorbitol salt forming counter ions such as sodium metal complexes e.g. Zn protein complexes and or non ionic surfactants such as TWEEN PLURONICS or polyethylene glycol PEG .

The anti CD19 antibody compositions also may contain optionally suitable preservatives such as benzalkonium chloride chlorobutanol parabens and thimerosal.

The anti CD19 antibody compositions may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods include the step of bringing the active agent into association with a carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing the active compound into association with a liquid carrier a finely divided solid carrier or both and then if necessary shaping the product.

Compositions suitable for parenteral administration conveniently comprise a sterile aqueous or non aqueous preparation of anti CD19 antibody which is preferably isotonic with the blood of the recipient. This preparation may be formulated according to known methods using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation also may be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent for example as a solution in 1 3 butane diol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water Ringer s solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition sterile fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono or di glycerides. In addition fatty acids such as oleic acid may be used in the preparation of injectables. Carrier formulation suitable for oral subcutaneous intravenous intramuscular etc. administration can be found in Mack Publishing Co. Easton Pa. In certain embodiments carrier formulation suitable for various routes of administration can be the same or similar to that described for RITUXAN . See Medical Economics Company Inc. Montvale N.J. 2005 pp. 958 960 and 1354 1357 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In certain embodiments of the invention the anti CD19 antibody compositions are formulated for intravenous administration with sodium chloride sodium citrate dihydrate polysorbate 80 and sterile water where the pH of the composition is adjusted to approximately 6.5. Those of skill in the art are aware that intravenous injection provides a useful mode of administration due to the thoroughness of the circulation in rapidly distributing antibodies. Intravenous administration however is subject to limitation by a vascular barrier comprising endothelial cells of the vasculature and the subendothelial matrix. Still the vascular barrier is a more notable problem for the uptake of therapeutic antibodies by solid tumors. Lymphomas have relatively high blood flow rates contributing to effective antibody delivery. Intralymphatic routes of administration such as subcutaneous or intramuscular injection or by catheterization of lymphatic vessels also provide a useful means of treating B cell lymphomas or autoimmune diseases or disorders. In preferred embodiments anti CD19 antibodies of the compositions and methods of the invention are self administered subcutaneously. In such preferred embodiments the composition is formulated as a lyophilized drug or in a liquid buffer e.g. PBS and or citrate at about 50 mg mL.

The formulation herein may also contain more than one active compound as necessary for the particular indication being treated preferably those with complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other. For example it may be desirable to further provide an immunosuppressive agent. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended.

The active ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsule prepared for example by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization for example hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin microcapsule and poly methylmethacylate microcapsule respectively in colloidal drug delivery systems for example liposomes albumin microspheres microemulsions nano particles and nanocapsules or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in 16th edition Osol A. Ed. 1980 .

The formulations to be used for in vivo administration are typically sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.

Sustained release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the anti CD19 antibody which matrices are in the form of shaped articles e.g. films or microcapsule. Examples of sustained release matrices include polyesters hydrogels for example poly 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate or poly vinylalcohol polylactides U.S. Pat. No. 3 773 919 copolymers of L glutamic acid and ethyl L glutamate non degradable ethylene vinyl acetate degradable lactic acid glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate and poly D 3 hydroxybutyric acid. While polymers such as ethylene vinyl acetate and lactic acid glycolic acid enable release of molecules for over 100 days certain hydrogels release proteins for shorter time periods. When encapsulated antibodies remain in the body for a long time they may denature or aggregate as a result of exposure to moisture at 37 C. resulting in a loss of biological activity and possible changes in immunogenicity. Rational strategies can be devised for stabilization depending on the mechanism involved. For example if the aggregation mechanism is discovered to be intermolecular S S bond formation through thio disulfide interchange stabilization may be achieved by modifying sulfhydryl residues lyophilizing from acidic solutions controlling moisture content using appropriate additives and developing specific polymer matrix compositions. In certain embodiments the pharmaceutically acceptable carriers used in the compositions of the invention do not affect human ADCC or CDC.

The anti CD19 antibody compositions disclosed herein may also be formulated as immunoliposomes. A liposome is a small vesicle composed of various types of lipids phospholipids and or surfactant which is useful for delivery of a drug such as the anti CD19 antibodies disclosed herein to a human. The components of the liposome are commonly arranged in a bilayer formation similar to the lipid arrangement of biological membranes. Liposomes containing the antibodies of the invention are prepared by methods known in the art such as described in Epstein et al. 82 3688 1985 Hwang et al. 77 4030 1980 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 485 045 and 4 544 545. Liposomes with enhanced circulation time are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 013 556. Particularly useful liposomes can be generated by the reverse phase evaporation method with a lipid composition comprising phosphatidylcholine cholesterol and PEG derivatized phosphatidylethanolamine PEG PE . Liposomes are extruded through filters of defined pore size to yield liposomes with the desired diameter. The antibody of the present invention can be conjugated to the liposomes as described in Martin et al. 257 286 288 1982 via a disulfide interchange reaction. A therapeutic agent can also be contained within the liposome. See Gabizon et al. 19 1484 1989 .

The serum circulation of the anti CD19 antibodies of the invention in vivo may also be prolonged by attaching inert polymer molecules such as high molecular weight polyethyleneglycol PEG to the antibodies with or without a multifunctional linker either through site specific conjugation of the PEG to the N or C terminus of the antibodies or via epsilon amino groups present on lysyl residues. Linear or branched polymer derivatization that results in minimal loss of biological activity will be used. The degree of conjugation can be closely monitored by SDS PAGE and mass spectrometry to ensure proper conjugation of PEG molecules to the antibodies. Unreacted PEG can be separated from antibody PEG conjugates by size exclusion or by ion exchange chromatography. PEG derivatized antibodies can be tested for binding activity as well as for in vivo efficacy using methods known to those of skill in the art for example by immunoassays described herein.

Plasma half life of the antibodies of the compositions may be prolonged by altering the amino acid sequence of the antibody by introducing one or more changes in the heavy and or light chain gene nucleic acid sequence to produce the desired amino acid change. Such changes could include but are not limited to changes in the variable region framework regions and or in the Fc constant region. The techniques for altering antibody gene sequences are well known in the art.

WO 93 15199 WO 93 15200 and WO 01 77137 and European Patent No. EP 413 622 all of which are incorporated herein by reference.

In accordance with the present invention each of the methods of administration and doses described herein can be used in the anti CD19 immunotherapy protocols described below.

Administration of the compositions of the invention to a human patient can be by any route including but not limited to intravenous intradermal transdermal subcutaneous intramuscular inhalation e.g. via an aerosol buccal e.g. sub lingual topical i.e. both skin and mucosal surfaces including airway surfaces intrathecal intraarticular intraplural intracerebral intra arterial intraperitoneal oral intralymphatic intranasal rectal or vaginal administration by perfusion through a regional catheter or by direct intralesional injection. In a preferred embodiment the compositions of the invention are administered by intravenous push or intravenous infusion given over defined period e.g. 0.5 to 2 hours . The compositions of the invention can be delivered by peristaltic means or in the form of a depot although the most suitable route in any given case will depend as is well known in the art on such factors as the species age gender and overall condition of the subject the nature and severity of the condition being treated and or on the nature of the particular composition i.e. dosage formulation that is being administered. In particular embodiments the route of administration is via bolus or continuous infusion over a period of time once or twice a week. In other particular embodiments the route of administration is by subcutaneous injection given in one or more sites e.g. thigh waist buttocks arm optionally once or twice weekly. In one embodiment the compositions and or methods of the invention are administered on an outpatient basis.

In certain embodiments the dose of a composition comprising anti CD19 antibody is measured in units of mg kg of patient body weight. In other embodiments the dose of a composition comprising anti CD19 antibody is measured in units of mg kg of patient lean body weight i.e. body weight minus body fat content . In yet other embodiments the dose of a composition comprising anti CD19 antibody is measured in units of mg mof patient body surface area. In yet other embodiments the dose of a composition comprising anti CD19 antibody is measured in units of mg per dose administered to a patient. Any measurement of dose can be used in conjunction with the compositions and methods of the invention and dosage units can be converted by means standard in the art.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that dosages can be selected based on a number of factors including the age sex species and condition of the subject e.g. stage of B cell malignancy or activity of autoimmune disease or disorder physical condition of the transplant recipient or donor the desired degree of cellular or autoimmune antibody depletion the disease to be treated and or the particular antibody or antigen binding fragment being used and can be determined by one of skill in the art.

In certain embodiments the particular dosages will vary depending on whether the regimen is indicated for pre transplant conditioning post transplant maintenance or post transplant treatment of an acute or chronic rejection. For example a higher dose may be required for the treatment of an active rejection episode than that required for pre transplant conditioning or post transplant maintenance regimens. In certain embodiments the particular dosages chosen for pre or post transplant prophylaxis may also be affected by factors such as whether the patient is assessed as being at a high intermediate or low risk of developing a humoral response. For example a patient at high risk for developing a humoral immune response may require a higher prophylactic dose than a patient assessed as being at low risk. In other embodiments additional factors affecting dose may include whether there are clinical indications of an early or a late stage humoral rejection. For example a lower dose may be required for treatment of an early stage rejection such as a latent silent or preclinical humoral response while a higher dose may be required to treat a more advanced stage of rejection such as one exhibiting indications of graft dysfunction. In certain embodiments the particular dosages chosen will vary depending on whether the anti CD19 antibody compositions of the invention comprise or are used in combination with a therapeutic regimen for the treatment or prevention of GVHD graft rejection or post transplant lymphoproliferative disorder. In a particular embodiment a lower dose is used when the anti CD19 antibody compositions of the invention are used in combination with one or more other therapeutic agents. In a preferred embodiment the dose of one or more other therapeutic agents used in combination with the antibodies and compositions of the invention is lower than the dose that would otherwise be required.

According to another aspect of the methods of the invention a patient may be pretreated with the compositions and methods of the invention to detect minimize immunogenic response or minimize adverse effects of the compositions and methods of the invention. In some embodiments the patient is a transplant recipient who may be pretreated with the compositions and methods of the invention to desensitize minimize immunogenic response or minimize adverse effects of the compositions and methods of the invention.

The tolerance toxicity and or efficacy of the compositions and or treatment regimens of the present invention can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals e.g. for determining the LD50 the dose lethal to 50 of the population the ED50 the dose therapeutically effective in 50 of the population and IC50 the dose effective to achieve a 50 inhibition . In a preferred embodiment the dose is a dose effective to achieve at least a 60 70 80 90 95 or 99 depletion of circulating B cells or circulating immunoglobulin or both. The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50 ED50. Therapies that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. While therapies that exhibit toxic side effects may be used care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such agents to CD19 expressing cells in order to minimize potential damage to CD19 negative cells and thereby reduce side effects.

Data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosages of the compositions and or treatment regimens for use in humans. The dosage of such agents lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any therapy used in the methods of the invention the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated by appropriate animal models. Depending on the species of the animal model the dose is scaled for human use according to art accepted formulas for example as provided by Freireich et al. Quantitative comparison of toxicity of anticancer agents in mouse rat monkey dog and human Cancer 1966 40 219 244. Data obtained from cell culture assays can be useful for predicting potential toxicity. Animal studies can be used to formulate a specific dose to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 i.e. the concentration of the test compound that achieves a half maximal inhibition of symptoms as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Plasma drug levels may be measured for example by high performance liquid chromatography ELISA or by cell based assays.

According to certain aspects of the invention the treatment regimen and dose used with the compositions and methods of the invention is chosen based on a number of factors including but not limited to the stage of the B cell disease or disorder being treated. Appropriate treatment regimens can be determined by one of skill in the art for particular stages of a B cell disease or disorder in a patient or patient population. Dose response curves can be generated using standard protocols in the art in order to determine the effective amount of the compositions of the invention for treating patients having different stages of a B cell or disease or disorder. In general patients having more advanced stages of a B cell disease or disorder will require higher doses and or more frequent doses which may be administered over longer periods of time in comparison to patients having an early stage B cell disease or disorder.

The anti CD19 antibodies compositions and methods of the invention can be practiced to treat B cell diseases including B cell malignancies. The term B cell malignancy includes any malignancy that is derived from a cell of the B cell lineage. Exemplary B cell malignancies include but are not limited to B cell subtype non Hodgkin s lymphoma NHL including low grade follicular NHL small lymphocytic SL NHL intermediate grade follicular NHL intermediate grade diffuse NHL high grade immunoblastic NHL high grade lymphoblastic NHL high grade small non cleaved cell NHL mantle cell lymphoma and bulky disease NHL Burkitt s lymphoma multiple myeloma pre B acute lymphoblastic leukemia and other malignancies that derive from early B cell precursors common acute lymphocytic leukemia ALL chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL including immunoglobulin mutated CLL and immunoglobulin unmutated CLL hairy cell leukemia Null acute lymphoblastic leukemia Waldenstrom s Macroglobulinemia diffuse large B cell lymphoma DLBCL including germinal center B cell like GCB DLBCL activated B cell like ABC DLBCL and type 3 DLBCL pro lymphocytic leukemia light chain disease plasmacytoma osteosclerotic myeloma plasma cell leukemia monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance MGUS smoldering multiple myeloma SMM indolent multiple myeloma IMM Hodgkin s lymphoma including classical and nodular lymphocyte pre dominant type lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma LPL and marginal zone lymphoma including gastric mucosal associated lymphoid tissue MALT lymphoma.

The inventors have shown that the inventive antibodies and compositions can deplete mature B cells. Thus as another aspect the invention can be employed to treat mature B cell malignancies i.e. express Ig on the cell surface including but not limited to follicular lymphoma mantle cell lymphoma Burkitt s lymphoma multiple myeloma diffuse large B cell lymphoma DLBCL including germinal center B cell like GCB DLBCL activated B cell like ABC DLBCL and type 3 DLBCL Hodgkin s lymphoma including classical and nodular lymphocyte pre dominant type lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma LPL marginal zone lymphoma including gastric mucosal associated lymphoid tissue MALT lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL including immunoglobulin mutated CLL and immunoglobulin unmutated CLL.

Further CD19 is expressed earlier in B cell development than for example CD20 and is therefore particularly suited for treating pre B cell and immature B cell malignancies i.e. do not express Ig on the cell surface for example in the bone marrow. Illustrative pre B cell and immature B cell malignancies include but are not limited to acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In other particular embodiments the invention can be practiced to treat extranodal tumors.

In other aspects of the invention the treatment regimen and dose used with the compositions and methods of the invention is chosen based on a number of factors including but not limited to the stage of the autoimmune disease or disorder being treated. Appropriate treatment regimens can be determined by one of skill in the art for particular stages of a autoimmune disease or disorder in a patient or patient population. Dose response curves can be generated using standard protocols in the art in order to determine the effective amount of the compositions of the invention for treating patients having different stages of a autoimmune disease or disorder. In general patients having more activity of a autoimmune disease or disorder will require higher doses and or more frequent doses which may be administered over longer periods of time in comparison to patients having less activity of an autoimmune disease or disorder.

The anti CD19 antibodies compositions and methods of the invention can be practiced to treat an autoimmune disease or disorder. The term autoimmune disease or disorder refers to a condition in a subject characterized by cellular tissue and or organ injury caused by an immunologic reaction of the subject to its own cells tissues and or organs. The term inflammatory disease is used interchangeably with the term inflammatory disorder to refer to a condition in a subject characterized by inflammation preferably chronic inflammation. Autoimmune disorders may or may not be associated with inflammation. Moreover inflammation may or may not be caused by an autoimmune disorder. Thus certain disorders may be characterized as both autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. Exemplary autoimmune diseases or disorders include but are not limited to alopecia areata ankylosing spondylitis antiphospholipid syndrome autoimmune Addison s disease autoimmune diseases of the adrenal gland autoimmune hemolytic anemia autoimmune hepatitis autoimmune oophoritis and orchitis autoimmune thrombocytopenia Behcet s disease bullous pemphigoid cardiomyopathy celiac sprue dermatitis chronic fatigue immune dysfunction syndrome CFIDS chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy Churg Strauss syndrome cicatrical pemphigoid CREST syndrome cold agglutinin disease Crohn s disease discoid lupus essential mixed cryoglobulinemia diabetes eosinophilic fascites fibromyalgia fibromyositis glomerulonephritis Graves disease Guillain Barre Hashimoto s thyroiditis Henoch Sch nlein purpura idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis idiopathic autoimmune thrombocytopenia purpura ITP IgA neuropathy juvenile arthritis lichen planus lupus erthematosus M ni re s disease mixed connective tissue disease multiple sclerosis type 1 or immune mediated diabetes mellitus myasthenia gravis pemphigus related disorders e.g. pemphigus vulgaris pernicious anemia polyarteritis nodosa polychrondritis polyglandular syndromes polymyalgia rheumatica polymyositis and dermatomyositis primary agammaglobulinemia primary biliary cirrhosis psoriasis psoriatic arthritis Raynauld s phenomenon Reiter s syndrome Rheumatoid arthritis sarcoidosis scleroderma Sj gren s syndrome stiff man syndrome systemic lupus erythematosis SLE Sweet s syndrome Still s disease lupus erythematosus takayasu arteritis temporal arteristis giant cell arteritis ulcerative colitis uveitis vasculitides such as dermatitis herpetiformis vasculitis vitiligo and Wegener s granulomatosis. Examples of inflammatory disorders include but are not limited to asthma encephilitis inflammatory bowel disease chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD allergic disorders septic shock pulmonary fibrosis undifferentitated spondyloarthropathy undifferentiated arthropathy arthritis inflammatory osteolysis graft versus host disease urticaria Vogt Koyanagi Hareda syndrome and chronic inflammation resulting from chronic viral or bacteria infections.

CD19 is expressed on mature B cells as well as earlier in B cell development than for example CD20 and is therefore particularly suited for depleting pre B cells and immature B cells i.e. do not express Ig on the cell surface for example in the bone marrow.

According to certain aspects of the invention the treatment regimen and dose used with the compositions and methods of the invention is chosen based on a number of factors including for example clinical manifestation that place a patient at risk for developing a humoral rejection or clinical evidence that such a rejection is developing. The terms humoral and antibody mediated are used interchangeably herein.

The criteria for assessing the risk that a patient will develop a humoral rejection are established according to the knowledge and skill in the art. In one embodiment a positive complement dependent cytotoxicity or antiglobulin enhanced complement dependent cytotoxicity crossmatch indicates that a patient is at high risk for humoral rejection. In one embodiment a positive crossmatch or a prior positive complement dependent cytotoxicity or anti globulin enhanced complement dependent cytotoxicity crossmatch indicates that a patient is at an intermediate risk for humoral rejection. In one embodiment a negative crossmatch indicates that a patient is at a low risk for humoral rejection.

Appropriate treatment regimens can be determined by one of skill in the art for the particular patient or patient population. In particular embodiments the treatment regimen is a pre transplant conditioning regimen a post transplant maintenance regimen or post transplant treatment regimen for an acute or a chronic rejection. In certain embodiments the particular regimen is varied for a patient who is assessed as being at a high or intermediate risk of developing a humoral response compared with the regimen for a patient who is assessed as being at a low risk of developing a humoral response.

In certain embodiments the particular regimen is varied according to the stage of humoral rejection with more aggressive therapy being indicated for patients at later stages of rejection. The stages of humoral rejection may be classified according to the knowledge and skill in the art. For example the stages of humoral rejection may be classified as one of stages I to IV according to the following criteria Stage I Latent Response characterized by circulating anti donor alloantibodies especially anti HLA antibodies Stage II Silent Reaction characterized by circulating anti donor alloantibodies especially anti HLA antibodies and C4d deposition but without histologic changes or graft dysfunction Stage III Subclinical Rejection characterized by circulating anti donor alloantibodies especially anti HLA antibodies C4d deposition and tissue pathology but without graft dysfunction Stage IV Humoral Rejection characterized by circulating anti donor alloantibodies especially anti HLA antibodies C4d deposition tissue pathology and graft dysfunction.

Dose response curves can be generated using standard protocols in the art in order to determine the effective amount of the compositions of the invention for use in a particular regimen for example in conditioning regimens prior to transplantation and in post transplantation regimens for prophylaxis and treatment of GVHD humoral rejection or post transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders. In general patients at high risk for developing a humoral rejection and those already exhibiting one or more clinical indicators of rejection will require higher doses and or more frequent doses which may be administered over longer periods of time in comparison to patients who are not at high risk or who do not exhibit any indications of active rejection.

The anti CD19 antibodies compositions and methods of the invention can be practiced to treat or prevent GVHD humoral rejection or post transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders either alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents or treatment regimens. Other therapeutic regimens for the treatment or prevention of GVHD humoral rejection or post transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders may comprise for example one or more of anti lymphocyte therapy steroid therapy antibody depletion therapy immunosuppression therapy and plasmapheresis.

Anti lymphocyte therapy may comprise the administration to the transplant recipient of anti thymocyte globulins also referred to as thymoglobulin. Anti lymphocyte therapy may also comprise the administration of one or more monoclonal antibodies directed against T cell surface antigens. Examples of such antibodies include without limitation OKT3 muromonab CD3 CAMPATH 1H alemtuzumab CAMPATH 1G CAMPATH 1M SIMULECT basiliximab and ZENAPAX daclizumab . In a specific embodiment the anti lymphocyte therapy comprises one or more additional antibodies directed against B cells including without limitation RITUXAN rituximab .

Steroid therapy may comprise administration to the transplant recipient of one or more steroids selected from the group consisting of cortisol prednisone methyl prednisolone dexamethazone and indomethacin. Preferably one or more of the steroids are corticosteroids including without limitation cortisol prednisone and methylprednisolone.

Antibody depletion therapy may include for example administration to the transplant recipient of intravenous immunoglobulin. Antibody depletion therapy may also comprise immunoadsorption therapy applied to the graft ex vivo prior to transplantation. Immunoadsorption may be accomplished using any suitable technique for example protein A affinity or antibody based affinity techniques using antibodies directed against T cell or B cell surface markers such as anti CD3 antibodies anti CD19 antibodies anti CD20 antibodies and anti CD22 antibodies.

Immunosuppression therapy may comprise the administration of one or more immunosuppressive agents such as inhibitors of cytokine transcription e.g. cyclosporin A tacrolimus nucleotide synthesis e.g. azathiopurine mycophenolate mofetil growth factor signal transduction e.g. sirolimus rapamycin and the T cell interleukin 2 receptor e.g. daclizumab basiliximab . In a particular embodiment an immunosuppressant agent used in combination with the compositions and methods of the invention includes one or more of the following adriamycin azathiopurine busulfan cyclophosphamide cyclosporin A CyA cytoxin fludarabine 5 fluorouracil methotrexate mycophenolate mofetil MOFETIL nonsteroidal anti inflammatories NSAIDs rapamycin and tacrolimus FK506 . Immunosuppressive agents may also comprise inhibitors of complement for example soluble complement receptor 1 anti C5 antibody or a small molecule inhibitor of C1s for example as described in Buerke et al. 2001 167 5375 80 .

In one embodiment the compositions and methods of the invention are used in combination with one or more therapeutic regimens for suppressing humoral rejection including without limitation tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil therapy immunoadsorption intravenous immunoglobulin therapy and plasmapheresis.

The progression of cancer such as a B cell disease or disorder capable of tumor formation e.g. non Hodgkin lymphoma diffuse large B cell lymphoma follicular lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma is typically characterized by the degree to which the cancer has spread through the body and is often broken into the following four stages which are prognostic of outcome. Stage I The cancer is localized to a particular tissue and has not spread to the lymph nodes. Stage II The cancer has spread to the nearby lymph nodes i.e. metastasis. Stage III The cancer is found in the lymph nodes in regions of the body away from the tissue of origin and may comprise a mass or multiple tumors as opposed to one. Stage IV The cancer has spread to a distant part of the body. The stage of a cancer can be determined by clinical observations and testing methods that are well known to those of skill in the art. The stages of cancer described above are traditionally used in conjunction with clinical diagnosis of cancers characterized by tumor formation and can be used in conjunction with the compositions and methods of the present invention to treat B cell diseases and disorders. Typically early stage disease means that the disease remains localized to a portion of a patient s body or has not metastasized.

With respect to non tumor forming B cell diseases and disorders such as but not limited to multiple myeloma the criteria for determining the stage of disease differs. The Durie Salmon Staging System has been widely used. In this staging system clinical stage of disease stage I II or III is based on several measurements including levels of M protein the number of lytic bone lesions hemoglobin values and serum calcium levels. Stages are further divided according to renal kidney function classified as A or B . According to the Durie Salmon Staging System Stage I low cell mass is characterized by all of the following Hemoglobin value 10 g dL Serum calcium value normal or 12 mg dL Bone x ray normal bone structure scale 0 or solitary bone plasmacytoma only and Low M component production rate IgG value 12 g 24 h Subclassification either A or B where A is Relatively normal renal function serum creatinine value 

Another staging system for myeloma is the International Staging System ISS for myeloma. This system can more effectively discriminate between staging groups and is based on easily measured serum levels of beta 2 microglobulin 132 M and albumin. According to the ISS for myeloma Stage I is characterized by B2 M 

The stage of a B cell malignancy in a patient is a clinical determination. As indicated above with respect to solid tumors the spread location and number of tumors are the primary factors in the clinical determination of stage. Determination of stage in patients with non tumor forming B cell malignancies can be more complex requiring serum level measurements as described above.

The descriptions of stages of B cell diseases and disorders above are not limiting. Other characteristics known in the art for the diagnosis of B cell diseases and disorders can be used as criteria for patients to determine stages of B cell diseases or disorders.

The diagnosis of an autoimmune disease or disorder is complicated in that each type of autoimmune disease or disorder manifests differently among patients. This heterogeneity of symptoms means that multiple factors are typically used to arrive at a clinical diagnosis. Generally clinicians use factors such as but not limited to the presence of autoantibodies elevated cytokine levels specific organ dysfunction skin rashes joint swelling pain bone remodeling and or loss of movement as primarily indicators of an autoimmune disease or disorder. For certain autoimmune diseases or disorders such as RA and SLE standards for diagnosis are known in the art. For certain autoimmune diseases or disorders stages of disease have been characterized and are well known in the art. These art recognized methods for diagnosing autoimmune diseases and disorders as well as stages of disease and scales of activity and or severity of disease that are well known in the art can be used to identify patients and patient populations in need of treatment for an autoimmune disease or disorder using the compositions and methods of the invention.

Diagnostic criteria for different B cell malignancies are known in the art. Historically diagnosis is typically based on a combination of microscopic appearance and immunophenotype. More recently molecular techniques such as gene expression profiling have been applied to develop molecular definitions of B cell malignancies see e.g. Shaffer et al. 2 920 932 2002 . Exemplary methods for clinical diagnosis of particular B cell malignancies are provided below. Other suitable methods will be apparent to those skilled in the art.

In general most NHL with the exception of mantle cell lymphoma have highly mutated immunoglobulin genes that appear to be the result of somatic hypermutation SHM . The most common genetic abnormalities in NHL are translocations and mutations of the BCL6 gene.

Follicular NHL is often an indolent B cell lymphoma with a follicular growth pattern. It is the second most common lymphoma in the United States and Western Europe. The median age at which this disease presents is 60 years and there is a slight female predominance. Painless lymphadenopathy is the most common symptom. Tests often indicate involvement of the blood marrow and sometimes the peripheral blood. Follicular NHL is divided into cytologic grades based on the proportion of large cells in the follicle with the grades forming a continuum from follicular small cleaved cell to large cell predominance. See S. Freedman et al. 367 388 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 T. Lister et al. pp. 309 324 In B. Hancock et al. eds. Oxford University Press New York N.Y. 2000 .

Most follicular NHL is characterized by a translocation between chromosomes 14 and 18 resulting in overexpression of BCL2. Follicular NHL is also characterized by both SHM and ongoing SHM and a gene expression profile similar to germinal center GC B cells see e.g. Shaffer et al. 2 920 932 2002 which are the putative cells of origin for this malignancy. Heavy and light chain rearrangements are typical. The tumor cells of this disease express monoclonal surface immunoglobulin with most expressing IgM. Nearly all follicular NHL tumor cells express the antigens CD19 CD20 CD79a CD21 CD35 and CD10 but lack expression of CD5 and CD43. Paratrabecular infiltration with small cleaved cells is observed in the bone marrow. See S. Freedman et al. pp. 367 388 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 T. Lister et al. pp. 309 324 B. Hancock et al. eds. Oxford University Press New York N.Y. 2000 .

Diagnosis of follicular NHL generally relies on biopsy of an excised node in order to evaluate tissue architecture and cytological features. Fine needle aspirations are usually not adequate since this procedure is less likely to provide tissue that can be evaluated and it fails to provide enough tissue for additional tests. Bilateral bone marrow biopsies are also indicated since involvement can be patchy. Additional diagnostic procedures include chest x rays chest abdomen neck and pelvis computed tomography CT scans complete blood count and chemistry profile. Flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry can be used to distinguish between follicular NHL and other mature B cell lymphomas. See S. Freedman et al. pp. 367 388 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 T. Lister et al. pp. 309 324 B. Hancock et al. eds. Oxford University Press New York N.Y. 2000 

Mantle cell lymphoma localizes to the mantle region of secondary follicles and is characterized by a nodular and or diffuse growth pattern. Mantle cell lymphoma patients have median age of 60 65 years with the disease affecting predominantly males. For diagnostic purposes the usual presenting feature is a generalized lymphadenopathy. Additionally the spleen is often enlarged. This B cell lymphoma is associated with a t 11 14 between the IgH locus and cyclin D1 gene which results in overexpression of cyclin D1. More than 50 of cases show additional chromosomal abnormalities. Mantle cell lymphoma is typically not characterized by SHM. See W. Hiddemann et al. 461 476 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 D. Weisenburger et al. 28 41B. Hancock et al. eds. Oxford University Press New York N.Y. 2000 .

Immunophenotyping flow cytometry or frozen section immunohistochemistry of mantle cell lymphoma cells shows them to nearly always be monoclonal bearing surface IgM. Mantle cell lymphoma cells have also been noted to bear surface IgD. The cells express the antigens CD19 CD20 CD22 and CD24 but not CD23. They also express surface antigens CD5 but not for CD10 distinguishing them from true follicle center cell lymphomas which are almost always CD5 negative. Frequently extranodal involvement is found including bone marrow infiltration and tumors of the liver and gastrointestinal tract. Mild anemia and leukemic expression is not uncommon with mantle cell lymphoma. See A. Lal et al. pp. 181 220 In W. Finn et al. eds. Kluwer Academic Publishers Norwell M A 2004 W. Hiddemann et al. pp. 461 476 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 .

Diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma involves examination of the peripheral blood as well as bone marrow and lymph node biopsies. In addition cytogenetic studies and immunophenotyping are useful in differential diagnosis. See W. Hiddemann et al. pp. 461 476 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 D. Weisenburger et al. pp. 28 41 B. Hancock et al. eds. Oxford University Press New York N.Y. 2000 .

Burkitt s lymphoma is an aggressive B cell lymphoma typically observed in children and young adults and is usually associated with bulky disease of the jaw and or abdomen. Approximately 20 of patients have bone marrow involvement. An endemic form of Burkitt s lymphoma involves Epstein Barr virus EBV infection of malignant cells the sporadic form is independent of EBV infection. A translocation of c myc to immunoglobulin loci which results in deregulation of the c myc gene is characteristic of this disease t 8 14 q24 q32 . Interestingly deletions of the c myc sequences appear to be involved in the sporadic form of the disease while the endemic form usually involves point mutations or insertions. See V. Pappa et al. pp. 133 157 B. Hancock et al. eds. Oxford University Press New York N.Y. 2000 . Burkitt s lymphoma is also characterized by SHM and the malignant cells have a gene expression profile similar to GC B cells suggesting that this malignancy is derived from GC B cells.

Immunophenotype of Burkett s lymphoma shows the cells of this disease express CD19 CD20 CD22 and CD79a but not CD5 CD23 cyclin D or terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Frequently these cells are positive for CD10 and BCL6 and usually negative for BCL2. See I. Magrath et al. pp. 477 501 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 .

High grade B cell Burkitt s like lymphoma is a lymphoma borderline between Burkitt s lymphoma and large B cell lymphoma. The cells of this lymphoma express CD19 and CD20 but expression of CD10 which is nearly always present in true Burkitt s lymphoma is frequently absent. Because of this and other characteristics some believe this lymphoma should be classified as a diffuse large B cell lymphoma. See K. Maclennan pp. 49 54 B. Hancock et al. eds. Oxford University Press New York N.Y. 2000 .

Diagnosis of Burkitt s lymphoma generally relies on detection of the translocation associated with this lymphoma thus conventional cytogenetic analysis is usually performed. Long distance polymerase chain reaction techniques and fluorescent in situ hybridization FISH have been used to detect Ig myc junctions in the translocations and other genetic alterations associated with this disease. See R. Siebert et al. 91 984 990 1998 T. Denyssevych et al. 16 276 283 2002 .

DLBCL is the most common non Hodgkin s lymphoma and can arise from small B cell lymphoma follicular lymphoma or marginal zone lymphoma. Typically patients present with lymphadenopathy however a large percent of patients present in extranodal sites as well with gastrointestinal involvement being the most common. Bone marrow involvement is observed in about 15 of patients. See Armitage et al. pp. 427 453 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 . Heterogeneity in clinical biological and morphological characteristics makes this group of lymphomas difficult to subclassify. However two distinct subgroups have been identified with one expressing genes characteristic of germinal center B cells GC DLBCL and the other overexpressing genes in peripheral blood B cells. Survival rates are significantly better for patients with GC DLBCL than those with activated B cell type ABC DLBCL. See W. Chan 128 12 1379 1384 2004 .

DLBCLs express the cell surface antigens CD19 CD20 CD22 and CD79a. CD10 is expressed in the large majority of cases and CD5 expression is observed in about 10 of cases. See K. Maclennan pp. 49 54 B. Hancock et al. eds. Oxford University Press New York N.Y. 2000 . DLBCL is often marked by abnormalities of BCL6 and or translocations of BCL2 to the IgH locus. GC B cell like GC DLBCL is characterized by SHM with highly mutated immunoglobulin genes and ongoing SHM in malignant clones with a GC B cell like gene expression profile. Most GC DLBCL have undergone immunoglobulin class switching. ABC DLBCL is characterized by high level expression of NF B target genes including BCL2 interferon regulatory factor 4 CD44 FLIP and cyclin D. SHM but not ongoing SHM is present and ABC DLBCL does not have a GC B cell gene expression profile. Almost all ABC DLBCL express a high level of IgM.

Extranodal marginal zone lymphoma is an extranodal lymphoma that occurs in organs normally lacking organized lymphoid tissue e.g. stomach salivary glands lungs and thyroid glands . It is largely a disease that affects older adults with a median age of over 60 years. Often chronic inflammation or autoimmune processes precede development of the lymphoma. Gastric mucosal associated lymphoid tissue MALT lymphoma the most common type of marginal zone lymphoma is associated with infection. Studies have shown a resolution of symptoms with eradication of the infection following an antibiotic regimen. The presenting symptoms for gastric MALT lymphoma include nonspecific dyspepsia epigastric pain nausea gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia. Systemic symptoms are uncommon as are elevated levels of lactate acid dehydrogenase. See J. Yahalom et al. pp. 345 360 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 J. Radford pp. 325 330 B. Hancock et al. eds. Oxford University Press New York N.Y. 2000 . Systemic B symptoms include fevers greater than 38 C. for longer than 2 weeks without sign of infection night sweats extreme fatigue or unintentional weight loss of greater than or equal to 10 of body weight over the previous 6 months .

The immunophenotye of MALT lymphoma is characterized by expression of CD20 CD79a CD21 and CD35 and lack of expression of CD5 CD23 and CD10. About half of MALT lymphomas express CD43. The immunoglobulin typically expressed in the tumor cells of this disease is IgM while IgD is not expressed. These features are critical in distinguishing this lymphoma from other small B cell lymphomas such as mantle cell lymphoma lymphocytic lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. Trisomy 3 has been reported in 60 of MALT lymphoma cases. In 25 40 of gastric and pulmonary MALT lymphomas a t 11 18 is observed. This translocation is observed much less frequently in other MALT lymphomas. T 11 18 is associated with nuclear expression of BCL10. See J. Yahalom et al. pp. 345 360 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 . Marginal zone lymphomas are generally characterized by SHM and ongoing SHM.

Diagnostic procedures include immunophenotyping or flow cytometry to determine the identity of the cell surface markers. In addition molecular genetic analysis should be done to determine the presence of t 11 18 as this is an indicator that the disease will not respond to antibiotics. Histology can be used to determine the presence of . Additional tests should include a complete blood count basic biochemical tests including that for lactate acid dehydrogenase CT scans of the abdomen chest and pelvis and a bone marrow biopsy. See J. Yahalom et al. pp. 345 360 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 .

Nodal Marginal Zone B cell Lymphoma is a relatively newly classified lymphoma thus little has been published on it. It is a primary nodal B cell lymphoma sharing genetic and morphological characteristics with extranodal and splenic marginal zone lymphomas but does not localize to the spleen or extranodally. Hepatitis C virus has been reported to be associated with this lymphoma as has Sj gren s syndrome. See F. Berger et al. pp. 361 365 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 .

Nodal marginal zone lymphoma has a heterogeneous cytology and morphology. Due to its relatively high proportion of large cells this lymphoma unlike the other marginal lymphomas splenic and extranodal cannot be classified as true low grade B cell lymphoma. The genetic and immunological phenotype of nodal marginal zone lymphoma includes expression of CD19 CD20 BCL2 sIgM and cytoplasmic IgG cIg . These cells do not express CD5 CD10 CD23 CD43 or cyclin D1. The translocation characteristic of MALT lymphoma t 11 18 is not observed for nodal marginal zone lymphoma. These characteristics aid in the differential diagnosis of this lymphoma from other small B cell lymphomas. See F. Berger et al. pp. 361 365 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 .

Splenic Marginal Zone Lymphoma is an indolent micro nodular B cell lymphoma with a characteristic clinical presentation of prominent splenomegaly and infiltration of the peripheral blood and the bone marrow. In addition a relatively high level of liver involvement has been reported. A role for hepatitis C virus has been postulated for this lymphoma. The immunophenotype of splenic marginal zone lymphoma is typically CD20 IgD BCL2 p27 CD3 CD5 CD10 CD23 CD38 CD43 BCL 6 and cyclin D1. Genetic characteristics include a 7q deletion p53 alterations and SHM. See M. Piris et al. pp. 275 282 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 .

Diagnosis generally relies on immunophenotyping to determine the identity of the cell surface markers. Genetic and biochemical analysis in combination with data on cell surface markers help to differentiate this lymphoma from other small B cell lymphomas. See M. Piris et al. 275 282 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 .

ALL is a marrow based neoplasm largely affecting children with the highest incidence between 1 5 years. Most common symptoms at presentation include fatigue lethargy fever and bone and joint pain. Fatigue and lethargy correlates with the degree of anemia present. An elevated white blood cell count is common at presentment. Radiographs of the chest often show skeletal lesions. Extramedullary spread is common and involves the central nervous system testes lymph nodes liver spleen and kidney. Anterior mediastinal masses are observed in only about 5 10 of newly diagnosed cases. See J. Whitlock et al. pp. 2241 2271 Tenth Edition G. Lee et al. eds. Williams Wilkins Baltimore Md. 1999 .

The immunophenotype of ALL is CD10 CD19 CD20 and CD24. Pre B cell ALL cells express cytoplasmic but not surface immunoglobulin while mature B cell ALL which accounts for only 1 2 of ALL cases is distinguished from other leukemias of B cell lineage by the expression of surface immunoglobulin. Cytogenetic characteristics of ALL includes t 8 14 t 2 8 and t 8 22 . Although rarely detected at the cytogenetic level t 12 21 may be the most common cytogenetic abnormality associated with childhood ALL observed in about 25 of cases . See M. Kinney et al. pp. 2209 2240 Tenth Edition G. Lee et al. eds. Williams Wilkins Baltimore Md. 1999 J Whitlock et al. pp. 2241 2271 Tenth Edition G. Lee et al. eds. Williams Wilkins Baltimore Md. 1999 .

Precise diagnosis of acute leukemia usually relies on a bone aspirate and biopsy. Aspirate smears are used for morphological immunological and cytological assessments. The demonstration of lymphoblasts in the bone marrow is diagnostic of ALL. The presence of greater than 5 leukemic lymphoblast cells in the bone marrow confirms ALL diagnosis but most require greater than 25 for a definitive diagnosis. Lumbar punctures are used to diagnose central nervous system involvement. Serum uric acids levels and serum lactate dehydrogenase levels have been found to be elevated in ALL. See M. Kinney et al. pp. 2209 2240 Tenth Edition G. Lee et al. eds. Williams Wilkins Baltimore Md. 1999 J. Whitlock et al. pp. 2241 2271 Tenth Edition G. Lee et al. eds. Williams Wilkins Baltimore Md. 1999 .

CLL SLL is the most common type of leukemia. When the disease involves the peripheral blood and bone marrow it is referred to as CLL. However when the lymph nodes and other tissues are infiltrated by cells that are immunologically and morphologically identical to those in CLL but where leukemic characteristics of the disease are absent then the disease is referred to as SLL. This disease largely afflicts the elderly with a greater incidence of the disease occurring in men than women. Painless lymphadenopathy is the most common finding at presentation. Hypogammaglobulinemia is common with most cases of CLL SLL exhibiting reduced levels of all immunoglobulins rather than any particular subclass of immunoglobulins. Asymptomatic patients are frequently diagnosed during routine blood counts lymphocyte count of over 5000 10 L . As many as 20 of CLL SLL cases report B symptoms. An additional diagnostic feature is infiltration of the bone marrow by more than 30 by immature lymphocytes. Lymph node biopsies generally show infiltration of involved nodes with well differentiated lymphocytes. Autoimmune phenomena are often associated with CLL SLL including autoimmune hemolytic anemia and immune thrombocytopenia. See J. Gribben et al. pp. 243 261 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 K. Maclennan pp. 43 47 B. Hancock et al. eds. Oxford University Press New York N.Y. 2000 Clinical Oncology A. Neal et al. Neal Hoskin and Oxford University Press co publ. New York N.Y. 2003 

In contrast with many of the low grade B cell malignancies nonrandom reciprocal translocations are rarely found in CLL SLL. However other cytogenetic abnormalities have been reported including deletions at 13q14 11q22 23 and 17q13 with the latter two involving the p53 locus. Approximately 20 of cases exhibit trisomy 12. An elevated level of B 2 microglobulin higher levels of CD38 expression and the production of tumor necrosis factor alpha are all characteristic of CLL SLL. The immunophenotype of CLL SLL is very diagnostic and includes weak expression of surface immunoglobulin usually IgM or IgM and IgG as well as expression of the cell antigens CD19 CD20 and usually CD5 and CD23. See J. Gribben et al. pp. 243 261 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 K. Maclennan pp. 43 47 B. Hancock et al. eds. Oxford University Press New York N.Y. 2000 .

PLL once considered a variant of CLL is now understood to be a distinct disease. PLL is generally a disease of elderly men and is characterized by a very high white blood cell count greater than 200 10 L and splenomegaly. Additional symptoms include anemia and thrombocytopenia. Prolymphocytes in PLL comprise more than 55 of the cells in the blood and bone marrow. In contrast with CLL autoimmune phenomena are rarely observed in PLL. See J. Gribben et al. pp. 243 261 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 .

The immunophenotype of PLL is characterized by expression of CD19 CD21 CD22 CD24 and FMC7. The cells of PLL do not express CD23 and most do not express CD5. PLL cells exhibit complex chromosomal abnormalities with deletions at 13q14 and 11q23 being some of the most frequent. The pattern of p53 mutation in PLL cells is different from that observed for CLL. Differential diagnosis usually relies on complete blood count histological immunophenotypic and genetic analyses. See J. Gribben et al. pp. 243 261 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 .

HCL is a rare indolent chronic leukemia affecting more men than women and largely those of middle age. The typical symptoms include massive splenomegaly and pancytopenia. The peripheral blood and bone marrow contain the typical hairy cells which are B lymphocytes with cytoplasmic projections. Over 90 of HCL patients have bone marrow infiltration. See A. Neal et al. Neal Hoskin and Oxford University Press co publ. New York N.Y. 2003 J. Johnston pp. 2428 2446 Tenth Edition G. Lee et al. eds. Williams Wilkins Baltimore Md. 1999 .

Cytogenetic analysis has shown that clonal abnormalities are present in 19 of cases and involve numerical and structural abnormalities of chromosomes 5 7 and 14. The serum level of TNF is elevated in hairy cell leukemia and correlates with tumor burden. Hairy cell leukemia cells express surface immunoglobulins IgG and IgM and CD11c CD19 CD20 CD22 and typically CD25. In addition FMC7 HC 2 and CD103 are expressed. HCL cells do not express CD5 or CD10. Diagnosis generally involves the use of bone marrow aspirates cytogenetics blood smears and immunophenotyping. See A. Neal et al. Neal Hoskin and Oxford University Press co publ. New York N.Y. 2003 J. Johnston pp. 2428 2446 In Tenth Edition G. Lee et al. eds. Williams Wilkins Baltimore Md. 1999 .

5.5.3.12. Precursor B Cell Lymphoblastic Lymphoma Pre B Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Lymphoblastic Lymphoma

Precursor B cell lymphoblastic lymphoma pre B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia Lymphoblastic lymphoma is a disease of precursor T or B cells. The T and B cell lymphoblastic lymphomas are morphologically identical but clinical distinctions may be made based on degree of bone marrow infiltration or bone marrow involvement. 85 90 of lymphoblastic lymphomas are T cell derived with the remainder being B cell derived. Lymphoblastic lymphoma has a median age of 20 years with a male predominance. Peripheral lymph node involvement is a common feature at presentation occurring especially in the cervical supraclavicular and axillary regions. This disease frequently presents with bone marrow involvement. Central nervous system is less common at presentment but often appears in cases of relapse. Other sites of involvement can include liver spleen bone skin pharynx and testes See J. Sweetenham et al. pp. 503 513 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 .

Precursor B cell lymphoblastic lymphomas express immature markers B cell markers such as CD99 CD34 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. These cells also express CD79a CD19 and sometimes CD20 and typically lack expression of CD45 and surface immunoglobulin. Translocations at 11q23 as well as t 9 22 q34 q11.2 and t 12 21 p13 q22 have been associated with poor prognosis. Good prognosis is associated with hyperdiploid karyotype especially that associated with trisomy 4 10 and 17 and t 12 21 p13 q22 . See J. Sweetenham et al. pp. 503 513 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 .

Diagnostic tests include lymph node biopsies blood tests x rays CT scans and lumbar punctures to examine the cerebralspinal fluid for malignant cells.

Primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma is a diffuse large B cell lymphoma occurring predominantly in young women and characterized by a locally invasive anterior mediastinal mass originating in the thymus. Distant spread to peripheral nodes and bone marrow involvement is unusual. Systemic symptoms are common. While this disease resembles nodal large cell lymphomas it has distinct genetic immunological and morphological characteristics.

The immunophenotype of tumor cells of primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma are often surface immunoglobulin negative but do express such B cell associated antigens as CD19 CD20 CD22 and CD79a. CD10 and BCL6 are also commonly expressed. Expression of plasma cell associated markers CD15 CD30 epithelial membrane antigen EMA is rare. BCL6 and c myc gene arrangements are also uncommon. The presence of clonal immunoglobulin rearrangements immunoglobulin variable region and gene hypermutation along with BCL6 hypermutation suggest that this lymphoma derives from a mature germinal center or post germinal center B cell. The chromosomal translocations that seem to be associated with tumors of this disease are similar to those observed in other forms of diffuse large cell lymphoma. See P. Zinzani et al. pp. 455 460 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 .

The diagnostic evaluation for primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma generally includes a complete physical examination complete hematological and biochemical analysis total body computerized tomography and bone marrow biopsy. Gallium 67 scanning is a useful test for staging response to treatment and for assessment of relapse. See P. Zinzani et al. pp. 455 460 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 .

The immunophenotype of this disease shows expression of the B cell associated antigens CD19 CD20 CD22 and CD79a and a lack of expression of CD5 CD10 and CD23. Presence of strong surface immunoglobulin and CD20 the lack of expression of CD5 and CD23 and the presence of cytoplasmic immunoglobulin are characteristics that aid in distinguishing this disease from chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Also diagnostic of this disease is t 9 14 p13 q32 . See A. Rohatiner et al. pp. 263 273 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 K. Maclennan pp. 43 47 B. Hancock et al. eds. Oxford University Press New York N.Y. 2000 R. Chaganti et al. pp. 809 824 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 .

Diagnostic tests typically include a complete blood count renal and liver function tests CT scans biopsy and aspiration of the bone marrow protein electrophoresis to quantify and characterize the paraprotein and serum viscosity. Measurement of microglobulin is used as a prognostic test. See A. Rohatiner et al. pp. 263 273 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 .

5.5.3.14. Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma LPL Lymphoplasmacytic Immunocytoma Waldstr m s Macroglobulinemia

LPL Lymphoplasmacytic immunocytoma Waldstr m s Macroglobulinemia is a nodal lymphoma that is usually indolent and often involves bone marrow lymph nodes and spleen. This is generally a disease of older adults with males slightly predominating. Most patients have monoclonal IgM paraprotein in their serum 3 g dL resulting in hyperviscosity of the serum. Tumor cells have a plasmacytic morphology. A subset of LPL is characterized by recurrent translocations between chromosomes 9 and 14 which involves the PAX5 and immunoglobulin heavy chain loci. LPL is characterized by SHM as well as ongoing SHM and is believed to be derived from post GC B cells. See A. Rohatiner et al. pp. 263 273 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 K. Maclennan pp. 43 47 B. Hancock et al. eds. Oxford University Press New York N.Y. 2000 A. Lal et al. pp. 181 220 In W. Finn et al. eds. Kluwer Academic Publishers Norwell Mass. 2004 .

Null acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a subset of ALL which lacks B or T cell characteristics. Phenotypic analysis of leukemic blasts shows a typical null ALL pattern i.e. CD10 common ALL antigen negative strongly HLA DR positive and CD19 B4 positive see Katz et al. 1988 Blood 71 5 1438 47 

Hodgkin s lymphoma usually arises in the lymph nodes of young adults. It can be divided into classical subtype and a less common nodular lymphocytic predominant subtype. The classical type exhibits SHM but not ongoing SHM and does not have a GC B cell gene expression profile. The nodular lymphocyte predominant type in contrast is characterized by SHM and ongoing SHM and a GC B cell gene expression profile. While the two types differ clinically and biologically they do share certain features such as a lack of neoplastic cells within a background of benign inflammatory cells. B. Schnitzer et al. pp. 259 290 In W. Finn and L. Peterson eds. Kluwer Academic Publishers Norwell Mass. 2004 .

The most common features at presentation are painless enlargement of lymph nodes usually in the neck but occasionally in the inguinal region. Waxing and waning of nodes is also characteristic of this disease. B symptoms are observed in about one third of patients. Isolated extranodal involvement is rare and in cases where dissemination has occurred extranodal involvement is observed about 10 20 of the time. See P. Johnson et al. pp. 181 204 B. Hancock et al. eds. Oxford University Press New York N.Y. 2000 .

Reed Sternberg RS cells are the malignant cells of Hodgkin s lymphoma. RS cells and their variants express CD15 CD25 CD30 and transferrin receptor. In addition these cells express polyclonal cytoplasmic immunoglobulin. In most cases of Hodgkin s lymphoma the RS cells do not express CD45 a feature that aids in distinguishing this disease from non Hodgkin s Lymphomas. Epstein Barr virus has been demonstrated to be present in Reed Sternberg cells in about one half of Hodgkin s lymphoma cases but its role is unclear.

Diagnosis is most frequently made by lymph node biopsy. Additional diagnostic tests include a full blood count often hematological tests are normal white blood cell counts of less than 1.0 10 L are seen in about 20 of cases erythrocyte sedimentation rate often elevated in advanced stages of the disease biochemical tests including electrolytes urea creatinine urate calcium hypercalcemia is rare but when present is associated with extensive bone involvement liver blood tests lactate dehydrogenase elevated levels often associated with advanced disease albumin and beta microglobulin 2 M . Lymphanigiograms and chest x rays and CT scans of the chest abdomen and pelvis are important in identifying abnormal lymph nodes and the extent of extranodal involvement. Bone marrow biopsies are typically considered optional as bone marrow involvement is unusual and the results of such biopsies appear not to affect clinical management or prognosis. Splenechtomies are not usually performed today as it rarely influences management and CT or MRI imaging provides information on splenic status. Significantly elevated levels of p55 TNF and sICAM 1 are correlated to the stage of the disease presence of symptoms and complete response rate. See P. Johnson et al. pp. 181 204 B. Hancock et al. eds. Oxford University Press New York N.Y. 2000 A. Neal et al. Neal Hoskin and Oxford University Press co publ. New York N.Y. 2003 R. Stein pp. 2538 2571 Tenth Edition G. Lee et al. eds. Williams Wilkins Baltimore Md. 1999 .

Multiple myeloma is a malignancy of plasma cells. Neoplastic cells are located in the bone marrow and osteolytic bone lesions are characteristic. Reciprocal chromosomal translocations between one of the immunoglobulin loci and a variety of other genes e.g. cyclin D1 cyclin D3 c MAF MMSET multiple myeloma SET domain protein or fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 are believed to be the primary oncogenic events. Multiple myeloma is characterized by SHM and the putative cell of origin is a post GC B cell. Multiple myeloma is typically first identified by symptoms such as recurrent infection fatigue pain and kidney problems and is confirmed with clinical testing see for example 6th edition. DeVita V. T. Hellman S. and Rosenberg S. A. editors. 2001 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 19106 pp. 2465 2499 .

In certain embodiments patients who are candidates for treatment by the compositions and methods of the invention can undergo further diagnostic tests on blood and or urine to confirm the diagnosis or suspicion of multiple myeloma including but not limited to complete blood count CBC tests to determine if the types of cells reported in a CBC are within their normal ranges which are well known in the art blood chemistry profile to determine whether levels of various blood components such as albumin blood urea nitrogen BUN calcium creatinine and lactate dehydrogenase LDH deviate from standard values. Serum levels of beta microglobulin M can also be examined and surrogate markers for IL 6 a growth factor for myeloma cells. Urinalysis can be used to measure the levels of protein in the urine. Electrophoresis can be used to measure the levels of various proteins including M protein in the blood called serum protein electrophoresis or SPEP or urine called urine electrophoresis or UEP . An additional test called immunofixation electrophoresis IFE or immunoelectrophoresis may also be performed to provide more specific information about the type of abnormal antibody proteins present. Assessing changes and proportions of various proteins particularly M protein can be used to track the progression of myeloma disease and response to treatment regimens. Multiple myeloma is characterized by a large increase in M protein which is secreted by the myeloma tumor cells.

Diagnostic tests on bone can also be conducted to confirm the diagnosis or suspicion of multiple myeloma including but not limited to X rays and other imaging tests including a bone skeletal survey magnetic resonance imaging MRI and computerized axial tomography CAT also known as computed tomography CT can assess changes in the bone structure and determine the number and size of tumors in the bone. Bone marrow aspiration or bone marrow biopsy can be used to detect an increase in the number of plasma cells in the bone marrow. Aspiration requires a sample of liquid bone marrow and biopsy requires a sample of solid bone tissue. In both tests samples are preferably taken from the pelvis hip bone . The sturnum breast bone can also be used for aspiration of bone marrow.

Patients with multiple myeloma are typically categorized into the following three groups that help define effective treatment regimens. Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance MGUS is typically characterized by a serum M protein level of less than 3 g dL bone marrow clonal plasma cells of less than 10 no evidence of other B cell disorders and no related organ or tissue impairment such as hypercalcemia increased serum calcium levels impaired kidney function noted by increased serum creatinine anemia or bone lesions. Asymptomatic myelomas are typically stage I and includes smoldering multiple myeloma SMM and indolent multiple myeloma IMM . SMM is characterized by serum M protein greater than or equal to 3 g dL and IMM is characterized by bone marrow clonal plasma cells greater than or equal to 10 of the bone marrow cells. Symptomatic myeloma is characterized by M protein in serum and or urine and includes Stage II multiple myeloma characterized by the presence of bone marrow clonal plasma cells or plasmacytoma and Stage III multiple myeloma characterized by related organ or tissue impairment.

Osteosclerotic myeloma is a component of the rare POEMS syndrome polyneuropathy organomegaly endocrinopathy monoclonal gammopathy and skin lesions . Peak incidence is at 40 to 50 years of age. Systemic features include skeletal lesions marrow plasma cells 

Smoldering multiple myeloma patients generally present with stable disease for months years no anemia bone lesions renal insufficiency or hypercalcemia have 10 plasma cells in bone marrow and monoclonal serum protein. The criteria for smoldering multiple myeloma is compatible with the diagnosis of multiple myeloma however there is no evidence of progressive course. These are cases with a slow progression the tumor cell mass is low at diagnosis and the percentage of bone marrow plasma cells in S phase is low 3 g dL and or bone marrow plasma cells 10 absence of anemia renal failure hypercalcemia lytic bone lesions.

Indolent or asymptomatic multiple myeloma is a multiple myeloma diagnosed by chance in the absence of symptoms usually after screening laboratory studies. Indolent multiple myeloma is similar to smoldering myeloma but with few bone lesions and mild anemia. Most cases of indolent multiple myeloma develop overt multiple myeloma within 3 years. Diagnostic criteria are the same as for multiple myeloma except no bone lesions or one asymptomatic lytic lesion X ray survey M component level 

Solitary plasmacytoma is one of a spectrum of plasma cell neoplasms which range from benign monoclonal gammopathy to solitary plasmacytoma to multiple myeloma. Approximately seventy percent of all solitary plasmacytoma cases eventually result in multiple myeloma. These diseases are characterized by a proliferation of B cells which produce the characteristic paraprotein. Solitary plasmacytoma results in a proliferation of clonal plasma cells in a solitary site usually a single bone or extramedullary tissue site. Diagnostic criteria of solitary plasmacytoma include a histologically confirmed single lesion normal bone biopsy negative skeletal survey no anemia normal calcium and renal function. Most cases exhibit minimally elevated serum M protein paraprotein . The median age at diagnosis is 50 55 about 5 10 years younger than the median age for multiple myeloma. See C. Wilson pp. 113 144 In W. Finn and L. Peterson eds. Kluwer Academic Publishers Norwell Mass. 2004 S. Chaganti et al. pp. 809 824 P. Mauch et al. eds. Lippincott Williams Wilkins Philadelphia Pa. 2004 .

LCDD is a plasma cell dycrasias disorder caused by the over synthesis of immunoglobulin light chains usually kappa light chains that are deposited in tissues. Patients commonly present with organ dysfunction weakness fatigue and weight loss. In approximately 80 of cases of LCDD a monoclonal immunoglobulin is detected. Detection of monoclonal kappa light chains using immunofluorescent techniques is limited by the tendency of light chains to give excess background staining therefore ultrastructural immunogold labeling may be necessary. See C. Wilson pp. 113 144 In W. Finn and L. Peterson eds. Kluwer Academic Publishers Norwell Mass. 2004 .

PCL a plasma cell dycrasias is a rare aggressive variant of multiple myeloma. The criteria for plasma cell leukemia is a peripheral blood absolute plasma cell count of greater than 2 10 L or plasma cells greater than 20 of white blood cells. Determination of the presence of a CD138 population with cytoplasmic light chain restriction by flow cytometry will distinguish PCL from lymphoid neoplasm with plasmacytic features. PCL cells are also characterized by the lack of surface light chain and CD19 expression and either no or weak expression of CD45. About 50 of cases of PCL express CD20 and about 50 lack expression of CD56. The genetic abnormalities observed in PCL patients are the same as those observed for multiple myeloma patients but they are found at higher frequency in PCL. See C. Wilson pp. 113 144 In W. Finn and L. Peterson eds. Kluwer Academic Publishers Norwell Mass. 2004 .

Plasma cell leukemia has two forms if initial diagnosis is based on leukemic phase of myeloma then the primary form is present otherwise it is secondary. Primary plasma cell leukemia is associated with a younger age hepatosplenomegaly lymphadenopathy and fewer lytic bone lesions but poorer prognosis than the secondary form. The peripheral blood of plasma cell leukemic patients has greater than 20 plasma cells with absolute count of 2000 ml or more.

MGUS is a relatively common condition characterized by the presence of electrophoretically homogeneous immunoglobulins or benign M components. The occurrence of this condition appears to increase with age. Most individuals carrying the M components never develop malignant plasma cell dycrasias such as multiple myeloma. However some individuals with this condition have associated malignant conditions. When symptomatic patients can have enlarged liver or spleen and pleuroneuropathy. See J. Foerster pp. 2612 2630 Tenth Edition G. Lee et al. eds. Williams Wilkins Baltimore Md. 1999 .

MGUS can be differentiated from multiple myeloma by the presence of increased number of monoclonal plasma cells circulating in the peripheral blood. The serological characteristics of M components are identical to other plasma cell dycrasias conditions however the total concentration of M component is usually less than 30 g L. The paraprotein is usually IgG however multiple paraproteins may be present including IgG IgA IgM. The relative amount of each of the individual immunoglobulin classes is typically proportional to that found in normal serum. Proteinemia or proteinuria is rare. Serial measurements of M protein levels in the blood and urine and continued monitoring of the clinical and laboratory features including protein electrophoresis is the most reliable method of differentiating MGUS from early stage plasma cell dycrasias. Tenth Edition G. Lee et al. eds. Williams Wilkins Baltimore Md. 1999 .

The inventors have shown that the inventive anti CD19 compositions can deplete mature B cells. Thus as another aspect the invention can be practiced to treat mature B cell malignancies including but not limited to follicular lymphoma mantle cell lymphoma Burkitt s lymphoma multiple myeloma diffuse large B cell lymphoma DLBCL including germinal center B cell like GCB DLBCL activated B cell like ABC DLBCL and type 3 DLBCL Hodgkin s lymphoma including classical and nodular lymphocyte pre dominant type lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma LPL marginal zone lymphoma including gastric mucosal associated lymphoid tissue MALT lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL including immunoglobulin mutated CLL and immunoglobulin unmutated CLL.

Further CD19 is expressed earlier in B cell development than for example CD20 and is therefore particularly suited for treating pre B cell and immature B cell malignancies e.g. in the bone marrow. Representative pre B cell and immature B cell malignancies include but are not limited to mantle cell lymphoma pre B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia precursor B cell lymphoblastic lymphoma and other malignancies characterized by CD19 expression.

Diagnostic criteria for different autoimmune diseases or disorders are also known in the art. Historically diagnosis is typically based on a combination of physical symptoms. More recently molecular techniques such as gene expression profiling have been applied to develop molecular definitions of autoimmune diseases or disorders. Exemplary methods for clinical diagnosis of particular autoimmune diseases or disorders are provided below. Other suitable methods will be apparent to those skilled in the art. In certain embodiments of the invention patients with low levels of autoimmune disease activity or patients with an early stage of an autoimmune disease for diseases where stages are recognized can be identified for treatment using the anti CD19 antibody compositions and methods of the invention. The early diagnosis of autoimmune disease is difficult due to the general symptoms and overlap of symptoms among diseases. In such embodiments a patient treated at an early stage or with low levels of an autoimmune disease activity has symptoms comprising at least one symptom of an autoimmune disease or disorder. In related embodiments a patient treated at an early stage or with low levels of an autoimmune disease has symptoms comprising at least 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 or 15 symptoms of an autoimmune disease or disorder. The symptoms may be of any autoimmune diseases and disorders or a combination thereof. Examples of autoimmune disease and disorder symptoms are described below.

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic disease mainly characterized by inflammation of the lining or synovium of the joints. It can lead to long term joint damage resulting in chronic pain loss of function and disability. Identifying patients or patient populations in need of treatment for rheumatoid arthritis is a process. There is no definitive test that provides a positive or negative diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. Clinicians rely on a number of tools including medical histories physical exams lab tests and X rays.

Physical symptoms vary widely among patients and commonly include but are not limited to joint swelling joint tenderness loss of motion in joints joint malalignment bone remodeling fatigue stiffness particularly in the morning and when sitting for long periods of time weakness flu like symptoms including a low grade fever pain associated with prolonged sitting the occurrence of flares of disease activity followed by remission or disease inactivity rheumatoid nodules or lumps of tissue under the skin typically found on the elbows they can indicate more severe disease activity muscle pain loss of appetite depression weight loss anemia cold and or sweaty hands and feet and involvement of the glands around the eyes and mouth causing decreased production of tears and saliva Sj gren s syndrome . For Sjogren s specifically the following references may be used Fox et al. Arthritis Rheum. 1986 29 577 586 and Vitali et al. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2002 . 61 554 558.

Apart form physical symptoms clinicians commonly use tests such as but not limited to complete blood count erythrocyte sedimentation rate ESR or sed rate C reactive protein rheumatoid factor anti DNA antibodies antinuclear antibodies ANA anti cardiolipin antibodies imaging studies radiographs X rays magnetic resonance imaging MRI of joints or organs joint ultrasound bone scans and bone densitometry DEXA . These tests are examples of tests that can be used in conjunction with the compositions and methods of the invention to check for abnormalities that might exist i.e. identify patients or patient populations in need of treatment or to monitor side effects of drugs and check progress.

Early symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis commonly are found in the smaller joints of the fingers hands and wrists. Joint involvement is usually symmetrical meaning that if a joint hurts on the left hand the same joint will hurt on the right hand. In general more joint erosion indicates more severe disease activity.

Symptoms of more advanced disease activity include damage to cartilage tendons ligaments and bone which causes deformity and instability in the joints. The damage can lead to limited range of motion resulting in daily tasks grasping a fork combing hair buttoning a shirt becoming more difficult. Skin ulcers greater susceptibility to infection and a general decline in health are also indicators of more advanced disease activity.

Progression of rheumatoid arthritis is commonly divided into three stages. The first stage is the swelling of the synovial lining causing pain warmth stiffness redness and swelling around the joint. Second is the rapid division and growth of cells or pannus which causes the synovium to thicken. In the third stage the inflamed cells release enzymes that may digest bone and cartilage often causing the involved joint to lose its shape and alignment more pain and loss of movement.

Molecular techniques can also be used to identify patients or patient populations in need of treatment. For example rheumatoid arthritis has been shown to be associated with allelic polymorphisms of the human leukocyte antigen HLA DR4 and HLA DRB1 genes Ollier and Winchester 1999 Genes and Genetics of Autoimmunity. Basel Switzerland Stastny 1978 N. Engl J Med 298 869 871 and Gregersen et al. 1987 Arthritis Rheum 30 1205 1213 . Rheumatoid arthritis patients frequently express two disease associated HLA DRB1 04 alleles Weyand et al. 1992 Ann Intern Med 117 801 806 . Patients can be tested for allelic polymorphisms using methods standard in the art. MHC genes are not the only germline encoded genes influencing susceptibility to RA that can be used to diagnose or identify patients or patient populations in need of treatment. Female sex clearly increases the risk and female patients develop a different phenotype of the disease than do male patients. Any molecular indicators of rheumatoid arthritis can be used to identify patients or patient populations in need of treatment with the anti CD19 antibody compositions and methods of the invention.

Methods for determining activity of rheumatoid arthritis in a patient in relation to a scale of activity are well known in the art and can be used in connection with the pharmaceutical compositions and methods of the invention. For example the American College of Rheumatologists Score ACR score can be used to determine the activity of rheumatoid arthritis of a patient or a patient population. According to this method patients are given a score that correlates to improvement. For example patients with a 20 improvement in factors defined by the ACR would be given an ACR20 score.

Initially a patient exhibiting the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis may be treated with an analgesic. In other embodiments a patient diagnosed with or exhibiting the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis is initially treated with nonsteroidal anti inflammatory NSAID compounds. As the disease progresses and or the symptoms increase in severity rheumatoid arthritis may be treated by the administration of steroids such as but not limited to dexamethasone and prednisone. In more severe cases a chemotherapeutic agent such as but not limited to methotrexate or cytoxin may be administered to relieve the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.

In certain instances rheumatoid arthritis may be treated by administration of gold while in other instances a biologic such as an antibody or a receptor or receptor analog may be administered. Examples of such therapeutic antibodies are Rituxin and Remicade. An illustrative example of a soluble receptor that can be administered to treat rheumatoid arthritis is Enbrel.

In extremely severe cases of rheumatoid arthritis surgery may be indicated. Surgical approaches may include but not be limited to synovectomy to reduce the amount of inflammatory tissue by removing the diseased synovium or lining of the joint arthroscopic surgery to take tissue samples remove loose cartilage repair tears smooth a rough surface or remove diseased synovial tissue osteotomy meaning to cut bone this procedure is used to increase stability by redistributing the weight on the joint joint replacement surgery or arthroplasty for the surgical reconstruction or replacement of a joint or arthrodesis or fusion to fuse two bones together.

Systemic lupus erythematosis SLE is a chronic long lasting rheumatic disease which affects joints muscles and other parts of the body. Patients or patient populations in need of treatment for SLE can be identified by examining physical symptoms and or laboraotry test results. Physical symptoms vary widely among patients. For example in SLE typically 4 of the following 11 symptoms exist before a patient is diagnosed with SLE 1 malar rash rash over the cheeks 2 discoid rash red raised patches 3 photosensitivity reaction to sunlight resulting in the development of or increase in skin rash 4 oral ulcers ulcers in the nose or mouth usually painless 5 arthritis nonerosive arthritis involving two or more peripheral joints arthritis in which the bones around the joints do not become destroyed 6 serositis pleuritis or pericarditis inflammation of the lining of the lung or heart 7 renal disorder excessive protein in the urine greater than 0.5 gm day or 3 on test sticks and or cellular casts abnormal elements the urine derived from red and or white cells and or kidney tubule cells 8 neurologic disorder seizures convulsions and or psychosis in the absence of drugs or metabolic disturbances which are known to cause such effects 9 hematologic disorder hemolytic anemia or leukopenia white blood count below 4 000 cells per cubic millimeter or lymphopenia less than 1 500 lymphocytes per cubic millimeter or thrombocytopenia less than 100 000 platelets per cubic millimeter The leukopenia and lymphopenia must be detected on two or more occasions. The thrombocytopenia must be detected in the absence of drugs known to induce it 10 antinuclear antibody positive test for antinuclear antibodies ana in the absence of drugs known to induce it and or 11 immunologic disorder positive anti double stranded anti DNA test positive anti sm test positive antiphospholipid antibody such as anticardiolipin or false positive syphilis test vdrl .

Other physical symptoms that may be indicative of SLE include but are not limited to anemia fatigue fever skin rash muscle aches nausea vomiting and diarrhea swollen glands lack of appetite sensitivity to cold Raynaud s phenomenon and weight loss.

Laboratory tests can also be used to identify patients or patient populations in need of treatment. For example a blood test can be used to detect a autoantibodies found in the blood of almost all people with SLE. Such tests may include but are not limited to tests for antinuclear antibodies ANA in the absence of drugs known to induce it Rahman A. and Hiepe F. . 2002 11 12 770 773 anti double stranded anti DNA Keren D. F. . 2002 22 2 447 474 anti Sm antiphospholipid antibody such as anticardiolipin Gezer S. Dis. Mon. 2003 49 12 696 741 or false positive syphilis tests VDRL .

Other tests may include a complement test C3 C4 CH50 CH100 can be used to measure the amount of complement proteins circulating in the blood Manzi et al. 2004 13 5 298 303 a sedimentation rate ESR or C reactive protein CRP may be used to measure inflammation levels a urine analysis can be used to detect kidney problems chest X rays may be taken to detect lung damage and an EKG can be used to detect heart problems.

Chronic SLE is associated with accumulating collateral damage to involved organ particuarly the kidney. Accordingly early therapeutic intervention is desirable i.e. prior to for example kidney failure. Available treatments for SLE are similar to those available for rheumatoid arthritis. These include initial treatments either with an analgesic or a nonsteroidal anti inflammatory NSAID compound. As the disease progresses and or the symptoms increase in severity SLE may be treated by the administration of steroids such as but not limited to dexamethasone and prednisone.

In more severe cases a chemotherapeutic agent such as but not limited to methotrexate or cytoxin may be administered to relieve the symptoms of SLE. However this approach is not preferred where the patient is a female of child bearing age. In such instances those therapeutic approaches that do not interfere with the reproductive capacity of the patient are strongly preferred.

In certain instances SLE may be treated by administration of a biologic such as an antibody or a receptor or receptor analog . Examples of such therapeutic antibodies are Rituxin and Remicade. An illustrative example of a soluble receptor for an inflammatory cytokine that can be administered to treat SLE is Enbrel.

In certain embodiments of the methods of invention a patient can be treated with an anti CD19 antibody prior concurrent or subsequent to any of the therapies disclosed above that are used for the treatment of SLE. Moreover the anti CD19 antibodies of the present invention may be administered in combination with any of the analgesic NSAID steroid or chemotherapeutic agents noted above as well as in combination with a biologic administered for the tretment of SLE.

Idiopathic autoimmune thrombocytopenia purpura ITP is a disorder of the blood characterized by immunoglobulin G IgG autoantibodies that interact with platelet cells and result in the destruction of those platelet cells. Typically the antibodies are specific to platelet membrane glycoproteins. The disorder may be acute temporary lasting less than 2 months or chronic persisting for longer than 6 months . Patients or patient populations in need of treatment for ITP can be identified by examining a patient s medical history physical symptoms and or laboratory test results. Provan D. and Newland A. . 2002 118 4 933 944 George J. N. . 2003 2 5 381 387 Karptkin S. . 2004 37 4 363 368 Cines D. B. and Blanchette V. S. . 2002 346 13 995 1008 .

Physical symptoms include purplish looking areas of the skin and mucous membranes such as the lining of the mouth where bleeding has occurred as a result of a decrease in the number of platelet cells. The main symptom is bleeding which can include bruising ecchymosis and tiny red dots on the skin or mucous membranes petechiae . In some instances bleeding from the nose gums digestive or urinary tracts may also occur. Rarely bleeding within the brain occurs. Common signs symptoms and precipitating factors also include but are not limited to abrupt onset childhood ITP gradual onset adult ITP nonpalpable petechiae purpura menorrhagia epistaxis gingival bleeding hemorrhagic bullae on mucous membranes signs of GI bleeding menometrorrhagia evidence of intracranial hemorrhage nonpalpable spleen retinal hemorrhages recent live virus immunization childhood ITP recent viral illness childhood ITP spontaneous bleeding when platelet count is less than 20 000 mm and bruising tendency.

Laboratory test that can be used to diagnose ITP include but are not limited to a complete blood count test or a bone marrow examination to verify that there are adequate platelet forming cells megakaryocyte in the marrow and to rule out other diseases such as metastatic cancer and leukemia. Isolated thrombocytopenia is the key finding regarding laboratory evaluation. Giant platelets on peripheral smear are indicative of congenital thrombocytopenia. A CT scan of the head may be warranted if concern exists regarding intracranial hemorrhage.

The current treatments for ITP include platelet transfusions and splenectomy. Other treatments include the administration of glucocorticoids administration of immunosuppressive agents administration of agents that enhance platelet production such as IL 11 and agents that activate megakaryocytes to produce platelets such as thrombopoietin TPO .

In more severe cases a chemotherapeutic agent such as but not limited to vincristine and vinblastine may be administered to relieve the symptoms of ITP. However this approach is not preferred where the patient is a female of child bearing age. In such instances those therapeutic approaches that do not interfere with the reproductive capacity of the patient are strongly preferred.

In certain instances ITP may be treated by administration of a biologic such as an antibody or a receptor or receptor analog . Examples of such therapeutic antibodies are anti CD20 antibodies such as Rituximab.

In certain embodiments of the methods of invention a patient can be treated with an anti CD19 antibody prior concurrent or subsequent to any of the therapies disclosed above that are used for the treatment of ITP. Moreover the anti CD19 antibodies of the present invention may be administered in combination with any of the agents noted above as well as in combination with a biologic administered for the tretment of ITP.

Both pemphigus and pemphigoid related disorders are a heterogenous group of autoimmune diseases characterized by a blistering condition of the skin and or mucosal surfaces. In both diseases the blistering is caused by autoimmune antibodies that recognize various proteins expressed on the surface of epithelial cells in the dermis and or epidermis.

In patients with pemphigus related disease the blistering occurs within the epidermis and is due to the binding of autoantibodies specific for desmoglein 1 Dsg1 and or desmoglein 3 Dsg3 . The classic subtypes of pemphigus can be distinguished according to anti desmoglein antibody specificities. Patients with pemphigus foliaceus PF produce anti Dsg1 antibodies only. Patients with pemphigus vulgaris PV and paraneoplastic pemphigus PNP produce anti Dsg3 antibodies if their lesions are restricted to mucosal tissues. In contrast PV and PNP patients with lesions of the skin and mucosa produce both anti Dsg1 and Dsg3 autoantibodies. Nagasaka T. et al. 2004 114 1484 1492 Seishema M. et al. 2004. 140 12 1500 1503 Amagai M. 1999. 20 2 92 102 

In patients with pemphigoid related disease including but not limited to bulous phemphigoid urticarial bulous pemphigoid cicatricial pemphigoid epidermolysis bullosa acquisita and Linear IgA bullous dermatosis the blistering occurs at the interface of the dermis with the epidermis. The most common form of pemphigoid disease is bulous pemphigoid BP which is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies that bind the bullous pemphigoid antigen 180 BP180 bullous pemphigoid antigen 230 BP230 laminin 5 and or beta 4 integrin. Fontao L. et al. 2003 14 5 1978 1992 Challacombe S. J. et al . 2001 59 4 226 234. 

Patients or patient populations in need of treatment for pemphigus or pemphigoid related disorders can be identified by examining a patient s medical history physical symptoms and or laboraotry test results reviewed in Mutasim D. F. . 2003 20 9 663 681 Yeh S. W. et al. . 2003 16 3 214 223 Rosenkrantz W. S. 15 2 90 98 .

Typically diagnosis of these pemphigus or pemphigoid related disorders is made by skin biopsy. The biopsy skin sample is examined microscopically to determine the anatomical site of the blister e.g. epidermis or between dermis and epidermis . These findings are correlated with direct or indirect immunohistochemical analyses to detect the presence of autoantibodies at the site of the lesion. Serum samples from patients may also be examined for the presence of circulating autoantibodies using an ELISA based test for specific proteins. Several ELISA based assays have been described for detection of desmoglein antibodies in human samples Hashimoto T. . 2003 295 Suppl.1 S2 11 . The presence of these desmoglein autoantibodies in biopsy samples is diagnistic of pemphigus.

Clinically pemphigus vulgaris can be diagnosed by the presence of blisters in the mouth. Inflammation or erosions may also be present in the lining of the eye and eyelids and the membranes of the nose or genital tract. Half of the patients also develop blisters or erosions of the skin often in the groin underarm face scalp and chest areas. Pemphigus foliaceus is a superficial relatively mild form of pemphigus. It usually manifests on the face and scalp but also involves the back and chest. Lesions do not occur in the mouth. The blisters are more confined to the outermost surface and often itch. Paraneoplastic pemphigus is very rare and generally occurs in people who have cancer. The lesions are painful and affect the mouth lips and esophagus swallowing tube as well as the skin. Due to involvement of the airways signs of respiratory disease may occur and can be life threatening.

The current treatments for pemphigus or pemphigoid related disease includes the topical administration of creams and ointments to alleviate the discomfort associated with the skin condition the administration of anti inflammatory agents or the administration of immunosuppressive agents.

In certain embodiments of the methods of invention a patient can be treated with an anti CD19 antibody prior concurrent or subsequent to any of the therapies disclosed above that are used for the treatment of pemphigoid or pemphigoid related disease. Moreover the anti CD19 antibodies of the present invention may be administered in combination with any of the agents noted above.

According to certain aspects of the invention a patient in need of treatment for autoimmune diabetes also known as type 1A diabetes can be treated with the anti CD19 antibody compositions and methods of the invention. Type 1A diabetes is an autoimmune disease caused by the synergistic effects of genetic environmental and immunologic factors that ultimately destroy the pancreatic beta cells. The consequences of pancreatic beta cell destruction is a decrease in beta cell mass insulin production secretion declines and blood glucose levels gradually rise.

Patients or patient populations in need of treatment for type 1A diabetes can be identified by examining a patient s medical history physical symptoms and or laboratory test results. Symptoms often come on suddenly and include but are not limited to low or non existent blood insulin levels increased thirst increased urination constant hunger weight loss blurred vision and or fatigue. Overt diabetes does not usually become evident until a majority of beta cells are destroyed 80 . Typically diabetes is clinically diagnosed if a patient has a random without regard to time since last meal blood glucose concentration 11.1 mmol L 200 mg dL and or a fasting no caloric intake for at least 8 hours plasma glucose 7.0 mmol L 126 mg dI and or a two hour plasma glucose 11.1 mmol L 200 mg dL . Ideally these tests should be repeated on different days with comparable results before diagnosis is confirmed. Harrison s Principles of Internal Medicine 16ed. editors Dennis L. Kasper et al. The McGraw Hill Companies Inc. 2005 New York N.Y. .

Although the precise etiology of type 1A diabetes is unknown there exists clear genetic linkage to specific HLA serotypes. In particular autoimmune diabetes is associated with HLA DR3 and DR4 serotypes. The presence of both DR3 and DR4 confers the highest known genetic risk. Susceptibility to autoimmune diabetes is also linked to HLA class II HLA DQB1 0302. In contrast HLA haplotypes with DRB1 1501 and DQA1 0102 DQB1 0602 are associated with protection from type 1A diabetes Redondo M. J. et al. 2000 10 3793 3797.

Systemic sclerosis also known as Scleroderma encompasses a heterogeneous group of diseases including but not limited to Limited cutaneous disease Diffuse cutaneous disease Sine scleroderma Undifferentiated connective tissue disease Overlap syndromes Localized scleroderma Morphea Linear scleroderma En coup de saber Scleredema adultorum of Buschke Scleromyxedema Chronic graft vs. host disease Eosinophilic fasciitis Digital sclerosis in diabetes and Primary anylooidosis and anyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma. Reviewed in Harrison s Principles of Internal Medicine 16ed. editors Dennis L. Kasper et al. The McGraw Hill Companies Inc. 2005 New York N.Y. .

Clinical features associated with scleroderma can include Raynaud s phenomenon skin thickening subcutaneious calcinosis telangiectasia arthralgias arthritis myopathy esophageal dysmotility pulmonary fibrosis isolated pulmonary arterial hypertension congestive heart failure and renal crisis. The extent to which an patient displays one or more of these disease manifestations can influence the diagnosis and potential treatment plan.

Autoantibodies include Anti topioisomerase 1 anticentromere anti RNA polymerase I II and or III anti Th RNP anti U RNP anti fibrillarin anti PM Sci anti nuclear antibodies ANA .

Identification of patients and patient populations in need of treatment of scleroderma can be based on clinical history and physical findings. Patients or patient populations in need of treatment for scleroderma can be identified by examining a patient s medical history physical symptoms and or laboraotry test results. Diagnosis may be delayed in patients without significant skin thickening. Laboratory X ray pulmonary function tests and skin or renal kidney biopsies can be used to determine the extent and severity of internal organ involvement.

In the early months or years of disease onset scleroderma may resemble many other connective tissue diseases such as but not limited to Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Polymyositis and Rheumatoid Arthritis.

The most classic symptom of systemic sclerosis scleroderma is sclerodactyl . Initial symptoms include swollen hands which sometimes progress to this tapering and claw like deformity. Not everyone with scleroderma develops this degree of skin hardening. Other symptoms can include morphea linear sclerodactyl hardened fingers Raynaud s syndrome calcinosis and telangiectasia.

Blood tests such as antinuclear antibody ANA tests can be used in the diagnosis of both localized and systemic scleroderma. For example anti centromere antibodies ACA and anti Scl 70 antibodies are indicative of patients in need of treatment for systemic sclerosis Ho et al. 2003 Arthritis Res Ther. 5 80 93 anti topo II alpha antibody are indicative of patients in need of treatment for local scleroderma and anti topo I alpha antibody are indicative of patients in need of treatment for systemic scleroderma. Several types of scleroderma and methods for diagnosing these types are recognized and well known in the art including but not limited to juvenile scleroderma Foeldvari 2002 Curr Opin Rheumatol 14 699 703 Cefle et al. 2004 Int J Clin Pract. 58 635 638 localized scleroderma Nodular Scleroderma Cannick 2003 J Rheumatol. 30 2500 2502 and Systemic scleroderma including but not limited to Calcinosis Raynaud s Esophagus Sclerodactyl and Telangiectasia CREST limited systemic scleroderma and diffuse systemic scleroderma. Systemic scleroderma is also known as systemic sclerosis SSc . It may also be referred to as Progressive Systemic Sclerosis PSSc or Familial Progressive Systemic Sclerosis FPSSc Nadashkevich et al. 2004 Med Sci Monit. 10 CR615 621 Frances et al. 2002 Rev Prat. 52 1884 90 . Systemic sclerosis is a multisystem disorder characterized by the presence of connective tissue sclerosis vascular abnormalities concerning small sized arteries and the microcirculation and autoimmune changes.

The type of systemic scleroderma known as CREST is not characterized by any skin tightening. CREST is characterized by Calcinosis calcium deposits usually in the fingers Raynaud s loss of muscle control of the Esophagus which can cause difficulty swallowing Sclerodactyl a tapering deformity of the bones of the fingers and Telangiectasia small red spots on the skin of the fingers face or inside of the mouth. Typically two of these symptoms is sufficient for diagnosis of CREST. CREST may occur alone or in combination with any other form of Scleroderma or with other autoimmune diseases.

Limited Scleroderma is characterized by tight skin limited to the fingers along with either pitting digital ulcers secondary to Raynaud s and or lung fibrosis. The skin of the face and neck may also be involved in limited scleroderma.

Diffuse Scleroderma is diagnosed whenever there is proximal tight skin. Proximal means located closest to the reference point. Proximal tight skin can be skin tightness above the wrists or above the elbows. Typically a patient with skin tightness only between their elbows and their wrists will receive a diagnosis of either diffuse or limited systemic Scleroderma depending on which meaning of proximal the diagnosing clinician uses.

The current therapies for scleroderma include extracorporeal photophoresis following 6 methoxypsoralen and autologous stem cell transplant 

The current treatments for scleroderma include the administration of the following agents penicillamine cholchicine interferon alpha interpheron gamma chlorambucil cyclosporine 5 fluorouracil cyclophosphamide minocycline thalidomide etanercept or methotrexate.

While not required assays for CD19 density can be employed to further characterize the patient s diagnosis. Methods of determining the density of antibody binding to cells are known to those skilled in the art See e.g. Sato et al. 165 6635 6643 2000 which discloses a method of assessing cell surface density of specific CD antigens . Other standard methods include Scatchard analysis. For example the antibody or fragment can be isolated radiolabeled and the specific activity of the radiolabeled antibody determined. The antibody is then contacted with a target cell expressing CD19. The radioactivity associated with the cell can be measured and based on the specific activity the amount of antibody or antibody fragment bound to the cell determined.

Alternatively fluorescence activated cell sorting FACS analysis can be employed. Generally the antibody or antibody fragment is bound to a target cell expressing CD19. A second reagent that binds to the antibody is then added for example a fluorochrome labeled anti immunoglobulin antibody. Fluorochrome staining can then be measured and used to determine the density of antibody or antibody fragment binding to the cell.

As another suitable method the antibody or antibody fragment can be directly labeled with a detectable label such as a fluorophore and bound to a target cell. The ratio of label to protein is determined and compared with standard beads with known amounts of label bound thereto. Comparison of the amount of label bound to the cell with the known standards can be used to calculate the amount of antibody bound to the cell.

In yet another aspect the present invention provides a method for detecting in vitro or in vivo the presence and or density of CD19 in a sample or individual. This can also be useful for monitoring disease and effect of treatment and for determining and adjusting the dose of the antibody to be administered. The in vivo method can be performed using imaging techniques such as PET positron emission tomography or SPECT single photon emission computed tomography . Alternatively one could label the anti CD19 antibody with Indium using a covalently attached chelator. The resulting antibody can be imaged using standard gamma cameras the same way as ZEVALIN Indium labeled anti CD20 mAb Biogen Idec is used to image CD20 antigen.

In one embodiment the in vivo method can be performed by contacting a sample to be tested optionally along with a control sample with a human anti CD19 antibody of the invention under conditions that allow for formation of a complex between an antibody of the invention and the human CD19 antigen. Complex formation is then detected e.g. using an FACS analysis or Western blotting . When using a control sample along with the test sample a complex is detected in both samples and any statistically significant difference in the formation of complexes between the samples is indicative of the presence of human CD19 in the test sample.

In other embodiments mean fluorescence intensity can be used as a measure of CD19 density. In such embodiments B cells are removed from a patient and stained with CD19 antibodies that have been labeled with a fluorescent label and the fluorescence intensity is measured using flow cytometry. Fluorescence intensities can be measured and expressed as an average of intensity per B cell. Using such methods mean fluorescence intensities that are representative of CD19 density can be compared for a patient before and after treatment using the methods and compositions of the invention or between patients and normal levels of hCD19 on B cells.

In patients where the density of CD19 expression on B cells has been determined the density of CD19 may influence the determination and or adjustment of the dosage and or treatment regimen used with the anti CD19 antibody of the compositions and methods of the invention. For example where density of CD19 is high it may be possible to use anti CD19 antibodies that less efficiently mediate ADCC in humans. In certain embodiments where the patient treated using the compositions and methods of the invention has a low CD19 density a higher dosage of the anti CD19 antibody of the compositions and methods of the invention may be used. In other embodiments where the patient treated using the compositions and methods of the invention has a low CD19 density a low dosage of the anti CD19 antibody of the compositions and methods of the invention may be used. In certain embodiments where the patient treated using the compositions and methods of the invention has a high CD19 density a lower dosage of the anti CD19 antibody of the compositions and methods of the invention may be used. In certain embodiments CD19 density can be compared to CD20 density in a patient CD19 density can be compared to an average CD19 density for humans or for a particular patient population or CD19 density can be compared to CD19 levels in the patient prior to therapy or prior to onset of a B cell or an autoimmune disease or disorder. In certain embodiments the patient treated using the compositions and methods of the invention has a B cell malignancy or an autoimmune disease or disorder where CD19 is present on the surface of B cells.

In accordance with the present invention each of the immunotherapeutic protocols described herein can utilize the routes and methods of administration and doses described in any of the preceding sections.

The anti CD19 antibody compositions used in the therapeutic regimen protocols referred to herein as anti CD19 immunotherapy can be naked antibodies immunoconjugates and or fusion proteins. The compositions of the invention can be used as a single agent therapy or in combination with other therapeutic agents or regimens. The anti CD19 antibodies or immunoconjugates can be administered prior to concurrently with or following the administration of one or more therapeutic agents. Therapeutic agents that can be used in combination therapeutic regimens with the compositions of the invention include any substance that inhibits or prevents the function of cells and or causes destruction of cells. Examples include but are not limited to radioactive isotopes chemotherapeutic agents and toxins such as enzymatically active toxins of bacterial fungal plant or animal origin or fragments thereof.

The therapeutic regimens described herein or any desired treatment regimen can be tested for efficacy using a transgenic animal model such as the mouse model described below which expresses human CD19 antigen in addition to or in place of native CD19 antigen. Thus an anti CD19 antibody treatment regimen can be tested in an animal model to determine efficacy before administration to a human.

Further CD19 is expressed earlier in B cell development than for example CD20 and is therefore particularly suited for treating pre B cell and immature B cell malignancies i.e. do not express Ig on the cell surface for example in the bone marrow. Illustrative pre B cell and immature B cell malignancies include but are not limited to acute lymphoblastic leukemia

In some embodiments the anti CD19 antibodies compositions and methods of the invention can be practiced to treat autoimmune diseases or disorders.

According to certain aspects of the invention the anti CD19 antibody used in the compositions and methods of the invention is a naked antibody. In related embodiments the dose of naked anti CD19 antibody used is at least about 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 5.5 6 6.5 7 7.5 8 8.5 9 9.5 10 10.5 11 11.5 12 12.5 13 13.5 14 14.5 15 15.5 16 16.5 17 17.5 18 18.5 19 19.5 20 20.5 mg kg of body weight of a patient. In certain embodiments the dose of naked anti CD19 antibody used is at least about 1 to 10 5 to 15 10 to 20 or 15 to 25 mg kg of body weight of a patient. In certain embodiments the dose of naked anti CD19 antibody used is at least about 1 to 20 3 to 15 or 5 to 10 mg kg of body weight of a patient. In preferred embodiments the dose of naked anti CD19 antibody used is at least about 5 6 7 8 9 or 10 mg kg of body weight of a patient.

In certain embodiments the dose comprises about 375 mg mof anti CD19 antibody administered weekly for 4 to 8 consecutive weeks. In certain embodiments the dose is at least about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 or 15 mg kg of body weight of the patient administered weekly for 4 to 8 consecutive weeks.

The exemplary doses of anti CD19 antibody described above can be administered as described herein. In one embodiment the above doses are single dose injections. In other embodiments the doses are administered over a period of time. In other embodiments the doses are administered multiple times over a period of time. The period of time may be measured in days months or weeks. Multiple doses of the anti CD19 antibody can be administered at intervals suitable to achieve a therapeutic benefit while balancing toxic side effects. For example where multiple doses are used it is preferred to time the intervals to allow for recovery of the patient s monocyte count prior to the repeat treatment with antibody. This dosing regimen will optimize the efficiency of treatment since the monocyte population reflects ADCC function in the patient.

In certain embodiments the compositions of the invention are administered to a human patient as long as the patient is responsive to therapy. In other embodiments the compositions of the invention are administered to a human patient as long as the patient s disease does not progress. In related embodiments the compositions of the invention are administered to a human patient until a patient s disease does not progress or has not progressed for a period of time then the patient is not administered the compositions of the invention unless the disease reoccurs or begins to progress again.

In other embodiments the compositions of the invention are administered to a human patient until the GVHD or rejection episode subsides. In another embodiment the compositions of the invention are administered to a human patient until graft function is substantially restored then the patient is not administered the compositions of the invention unless another rejection episode is indicated. In one embodiment the compositions of the invention are administered to a human patient until the lymphoproliferative disorder has been ameliorated as indicated by a reduction in the number of circulating B lymphocytes and or a reduction in the level of circulating immunoglobulin.

For example a patient can be treated with any of the above doses for about 4 to 8 weeks during which time the patient is monitored for disease progression i.e. activity of an autoimmune disease or disorder . If disease progression stops or reverses then the patient will not be administered the compositions of the invention until that patient relapses i.e. the disease being treated reoccurs or progresses. Upon this reoccurrence or progression the patient can be treated again with the same dosing regimen initially used or using other doses described above.

In certain embodiments the compositions of the invention can be administered as a loading dose followed by multiple lower doses maintenance doses over a period of time. In such embodiments the doses may be timed and the amount adjusted to maintain effective B cell depletion. In preferred embodiments the loading dose is about 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 or 18 mg kg of patient body weight and the maintenance dose is at least about 5 to 10 mg kg of patient body weight. In preferred embodiments the maintenance dose is administered at intervals of every 7 10 14 or 21 days. The maintenance doses can be continued indefinitely until toxicity is present until platelet count decreases until there is no disease progression until the patient generates an immune response to the drug or until disease progresses to a terminal state. In yet other embodiments the compositions of the invention are administered to a human patient until the disease progresses to a terminal stage.

In some embodiments the maintenance doses can be continued indefinitely until toxicity is present until platelet count decreases until there is no evidence of GVHD or rejection until the patient generates an immune response against the anti CD19 antibody compositions or until disease progresses to a terminal state.

In embodiments of the invention where circulating monocyte levels of a patient are monitored as part of a treatment regimen doses of anti CD19 antibody administered may be spaced to allow for recovery of monocyte count. For example a composition of the invention may be administered at intervals of every 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 or 30 days.

In embodiments of the invention where an anti CD19 antibody is conjugated to or administered in conjunction with a toxin one skilled in the art will appreciate that the dose of anti CD19 antibody can be adjusted based on the toxin dose and that the toxin dose will depend on the specific type of toxin being used. Typically where a toxin is used the dose of anti CD19 antibody will be less than the dose used with a naked anti CD19 antibody. The appropriate dose can be determined for a particular toxin using techniques well known in the art. For example a dose ranging study can be conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose of anti CD19 antibody when administered with or conjugated to a toxin.

In embodiments of the invention where an anti CD19 antibody is conjugated to or administered in conjunction with a radiotherapeutic agent the dose of the anti CD19 antibody will vary depending on the radiotherapeutic used. In certain preferred embodiments a two step process is used. First the human patient is administered a composition comprising a naked anti CD19 antibody and about 6 7 8 9 or 10 days later a small amount of the radiotherapeutic is administered. Second once the tolerance distribution and clearance of the low dose therapy has been determined the patient is administered a dose of the naked anti CD19 antibody followed by a therapeutic amount of the radiotherapeutic is administered. Such treatment regimens are similar to those approved for treatment of Non Hodgkin s lymphoma using ZEVALIN Indium labeled anti CD20 mAb Biogen Idec or BEXXAR GSK Coulter Pharmaceutical .

Anti CD19 immunotherapy encompasses methods of treating a B cell malignancy wherein the anti CD19 antibody mediates ADCC. Anti CD19 immunotherapy encompasses methods of treating a B cell malignancy wherein the anti CD19 antibody is administered before the patient has received any treatment for the malignancy whether that therapy is chemotherapy radio chemical based therapy or surgical therapy.

In a preferred embodiment a human subject having a B cell malignancy can be treated by administering a human or humanized antibody that preferably mediates human ADCC. In cases of early stage disease or single agent therapies any anti CD19 antibody that preferably mediates ADCC can be used in the human subjects including murine and chimeric antibodies however human and humanized antibodies are preferred.

Antibodies of the IgG1 or IgG3 human isotypes are preferred for therapy. However the IgG2 or IgG4 human isotypes can be used provided they mediate human ADCC. Such effector function can be assessed by measuring the ability of the antibody in question to mediate target cell lysis by effector cells in vitro or in vivo.

The dose of antibody used should be sufficient to deplete circulating B cells. Progress of the therapy can be monitored in the patient by analyzing blood samples. Other signs of clinical improvement can be used to monitor therapy.

Methods for measuring depletion of B cells that can be used in connection with the compositions and methods of the invention are well known in the art and include but are not limited to the following embodiments. In one embodiment circulating B cells depletion can be measured with flow cytometry using a reagent other than an anti CD19 antibody that binds to B cells to define the amount of B cells. In other embodiments antibody levels in the blood can be monitored using standard serum analysis. In such embodiments B cell depletion is indirectly measured by defining the amount to an antibody known to be produced by B cells. The level of that antibody is then monitored to determine the depletion and or functional depletion of B cells. In another embodiment B cell depletion can be measured by immunochemical staining to identify B cells. In such embodiments B cells extracted from patient tissues can be placed on microscope slides labeled and examined for presence or absence. In related embodiments a comparison is made between B cells extracted prior to therapy and after to determine differences in the presence of B cells.

Tumor burden can be measured and used in connection with the compositions and methods of the invention. Methods for measuring tumor burden are well known in the art and include but are not limited to the following embodiments. In certain embodiments PET scans can be used to measure metabolic activity and identify areas of higher activity which are indicative of tumors. CT scans and MRI can also be used to examine soft tissue for the presence and size of tumors. In other embodiments bone scans can be used to measure tumor volume and location. In yet other embodiments tumor burden can be measured by examining the blood flow into and out of a tumor using doppler technology e.g. ultrasound . In such embodiments changes in blood flow over time or deviations from normal blood flow in the appropriate tissue of a patient can be used to calculate an estimate to tumor burden. Such methods for measuring tumor burden can be used prior to and following the methods of treatment of the invention.

In preferred embodiments of the methods of the invention B cells are depleted and or tumor burden is decreased while ADCC function is maintained.

In embodiments of the invention where the anti CD19 antibody is administered as a single agent therapy the invention contemplates use of different treatment regimens.

In other embodiments the doses are administered over a period of time. In other embodiments the doses are administered multiple times over a period of time. The period of time may be measured in days months or weeks. Multiple doses of the anti CD19 antibody can be administered at intervals suitable to achieve a therapeutic benefit while balancing toxic side effects. For example where multiple doses are used it is preferred to time the intervals to allow for recovery of the patient s monocyte count prior to the repeat treatment with antibody. This dosing regimen will optimize the efficiency of treatment since the monocyte population reflects ADCC function in the patient.

In certain embodiments the compositions of the invention are administered to a human patient as long as the patient is responsive to therapy. In other embodiments the compositions of the invention are administered to a human patient as long as the patient s disease does not progress. In related embodiments the compositions of the invention are administered to a human patient until a patient s disease does not progress or has not progressed for a period of time then the patient is not administered the compositions of the invention unless the disease reoccurs or begins to progress again. For example a patient can be treated with any of the above doses for about 4 to 8 weeks during which time the patient is monitored for disease progression. If disease progression stops or reverses then the patient will not be administered the compositions of the invention until that patient relapses i.e. the disease being treated reoccurs or progresses. Upon this reoccurrence or progression the patient can be treated again with the same dosing regimen initially used or using other doses described above.

In certain embodiments the compositions of the invention can be administered as a loading dose followed by multiple lower doses maintenance doses over a period of time. In such embodiments the doses may be timed and the amount adjusted to maintain effective B cell depletion. In preferred embodiments the loading dose is about 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 or 18 mg kg of patient body weight and the maintenance dose is at least about 5 to 10 mg kg of patient body weight. In preferred embodiments the maintenance dose is administered at intervals of every 7 10 14 or 21 days. The maintenance doses can be continued indefinitely until toxicity is present until platelet count decreases until there is no disease progression until the patient generates an immune response to the drug or until disease progresses to a terminal state. In yet other embodiments the compositions of the invention are administered to a human patient until the disease progresses to a terminal stage.

In embodiments of the invention where circulating monocyte levels of a patient are monitored as part of a treatment regimen doses of anti CD19 antibody administered may be spaced to allow for recovery of monocyte count. For example a composition of the invention may be administered at intervals of every 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 or 30 days.

In embodiments of the invention where an anti CD19 antibody is conjugated to or administered in conjunction with a toxin one skilled in the art will appreciate that the dose of anti CD19 antibody can be adjusted based on the toxin dose and that the toxin dose will depend on the specific type of toxin being used. Typically where a toxin is used the dose of anti CD19 antibody will be less than the dose used with a naked anti CD19 antibody. The appropriate dose can be determined for a particular toxin using techniques well known in the art. For example a dose ranging study can be conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose of anti CD19 antibody when administered with or conjugated to a toxin.

In embodiments of the invention where an anti CD19 antibody is conjugated to or administered in conjunction with a radiotherapeutic agent the dose of the anti CD19 antibody will vary depending on the radiotherapeutic used. In certain preferred embodiments a two step process is used. First the human patient is administered a composition comprising a naked anti CD19 antibody and about 6 7 8 9 or 10 days later a small amount of the radiotherapeutic is administered. Second once the tolerance distribution and clearance of the low dose therapy has been determined the patient is administered a dose of the naked anti CD19 antibody followed by a therapeutic amount of the radiotherapeutic is administered. Such treatment regimens are similar to those approved for treatment of Non Hodgkin s lymphoma using ZEVALIN Indium labeled anti CD20 mAb Biogen Idec or BEXXAR GSK Coulter Pharmaceutical .

In certain embodiments of the methods of the invention a compound that enhances monocyte or macrophage function e.g. at least about 25 50 75 85 90 95 or more can be used in conjunction with the anti CD19 immunotherapy. Such compounds are known in the art and include without limitation cytokines such as interleukins e.g. IL 12 and interferons e.g. alpha or gamma interferon .

The compound that enhances monocyte or macrophage function or enhancement can be formulated in the same pharmaceutical composition as the antibody immunoconjugate or antigen binding fragment. When administered separately the antibody fragment and the compound can be administered concurrently within a period of hours of each other can be administered during the same course of therapy or can be administered sequentially i.e. the patient first receives a course of the antibody fragment treatment and then a course of the compound that enhances macrophage monocyte function or vice versa . In such embodiments the compound that enhances monocyte or macrophage function is administered to the human subject prior to concurrently with or following treatment with other therapeutic regimens and or the compositions of the invention. In one embodiment the human subject has a blood leukocyte monocyte neutrophil lymphocyte and or basophil count that is within the normal range for humans. Normal ranges for human blood leukocytes total is about 3.5 about 10.5 10 L . Normal ranges for human blood neutrophils is about 1.7 about 7.0 10 L monocytes is about 0.3 about 0.9 10 L lymphocytes is about 0.9 about 2.9 10 L basophils is about 0 about 0.3 10 L and eosinophils is about 0.05 about 0.5 10 L . In other embodiments the human subject has a blood leukocyte count that is less than the normal range for humans for example at least about 0.01 0.05 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 or 0.8 10 L leukocytes.

This embodiment of the invention can be practiced with the antibodies immunoconjugates or antibody fragments of the invention or with other antibodies known in the art and is particularly suitable for subjects that are resistant to anti CD19 anti CD20 and or anti CD22 antibody therapy for example therapy with existing antibodies such as C2B8 subjects that are currently being or have previously been treated with chemotherapy subjects that have had a relapse in a B cell disorder subjects that are immunocompromised or subjects that otherwise have an impairment in macrophage or monocyte function. The prevalence of patients that are resistant to therapy or have a relapse in an autoimmune disease or disorder may be attributable at least in part to an impairment in macrophage or monocyte function. Thus the invention provides methods of enhancing ADCC and or macrophage and or monocyte function to be used in conjunction with the methods of administering anti CD19 antibodies and antigen binding fragments.

In the examples below a transgenic mouse model was used for evaluating human CD19 directed immunotherapies. These data show that antibodies that both bind the CD19 antigen and mediate ADCC are effective at inducing B cell depletion in vivo in subjects having effector cells that express Fc R preferably Fc RIII or Fc RIV and carry out ADCC. Such antibodies can be used to induce a durable depletion of B cells in vivo and in certain embodiments can eliminate virtually all B cells from the circulation spleen and lymph nodes. Surprisingly bone marrow B cells and their precursors that express relatively low densities of the CD19 antigen are depleted as well. The effectiveness of B cell depletion is not dependent on which region of human CD19 an anti CD19 antibody binds but is influenced by CD19 density in the patient sample . The efficiency of B cell clearance may correlate with the anti CD19 antibody s ability to mediate ADCC. The efficiency of B cell clearance using anti CD19 antibodies may also correlate with host effector Fc R expression function.

The transgenic hCD19TG mice described herein or other transgenic animals expressing human CD19 can be used to assess different therapeutic regimens comprising human humanized or chimeric anti CD19 antibodies such as variations in dosing concentration amount or timing. The efficacy in human patients of different therapeutic regimens can be predicted using the two indicators described below i.e. B cell depletion in certain bodily fluids and or tissues and the ability of a monoclonal human or humanized anti CD19 antibody to bind B cells. In particular embodiments treatment regimens that are effective in human CD19 transgenic mice can be used with the compositions and methods of the invention to treat B cell malignancies in humans.

In order to determine whether human CD19 was expressed on B cells from transgenic mice hemizygous TG 1 expressing the human CD19 transgene B cells were extracted from the bone marrow blood spleen and peritoneal lavage of these mice. Human CD19 and mouse CD19 expression were assessed in these cells by contacting the cells with mouse monoclonal anti CD19 antibodies that bind CD19. Binding of the antibody to the B lineage cells was detected using two color immunofluorescence staining with flow cytometry analysis.

The results are shown in in graphs of the detected expression of murine CD19 mCD19 x axis plotted against the detected expression of human CD19 hCD19 y axis for bone marrow BM blood spleen and peritoneal lavage PL . The units of the axis represent a four decade log scale beginning with 1 on the lower left. The B4 anti CD19 antibody that binds to human CD19 Beckman Coulter was used to visualize human CD19 expression and the 1D3 CD19 antibody that binds to mouse CD19 PharMingen was used to visualize mouse CD19 expression also used for . While human CD19 expression increases incrementally during human B cell development murine CD19 is expressed at high levels during mouse bone marrow B cell development. shows that human CD19 expression parallels mouse CD19 expression on peripheral B cells found in blood spleen and peritoneal lavage PL demonstrating that the mouse anti hCD19 antibody that binds human CD19 binds the peripheral B cell populations. In addition a small population of bone marrow BM derived B cells express endogenous mouse CD19 but not human CD19 monoclonal mouse anti CD19 antibody that binds to human CD19 . Thus bone marrow B cells fall into two categories in hemizygous TG 1 mice mature B lineage cells that are hCD19 mCD19 and less mature B lineage cells that are only mCD19 . These results are consistent with the findings of Zhou et al. 14 3884 3894 1994 which indicated that human CD19 expression in these transgenic mice correlates with B cell maturation. All mature B cells within the blood spleen and peritoneal cavity were both hCD19 and mCD19.

The relative expression levels of mCD19 and hCD19 as assessed by measuring mean fluorescence intensity mouse anti CD19 for hCD19 and mouse anti CD19 for mCD19 respectively are shown in . Among TG 1 mice homozygous for the hCD19 transgene TG 1 hCD19 expression on blood borne B cells was comparable to hCD19 expression on human B cells. To compare the relative densities of hCD19 and mCD19 expression in TG 1 TG 1 and TG 2 transgenic mouse lines blood derived B cells were extracted and assayed for CD19 expression as described above. The results are shown in in histograms showing the percent human CD19 expression for human blood B cells TG 1 TG 1 and TG 2 blood B cells from hCD19TG mice left and the percent mouse CD19 expression for wild type WT mouse blood B cells TG 1 TG 1 and TG 2 CD19 blood B cells from hCD19TG mice right . The values linear values of mean fluorescent intensity represent the mean relative densities of CD19 expression SEM compared to blood B cells from humans or wild type WT mice shown as 100 . The results show that in homozygous TG 1 mice blood B cells expressed hCD19 at densities as measured by mean fluorescence intensities about 72 higher than human blood B cells. Blood B cells in TG 1 mice expressed hCD19 at densities similar to human blood B cells while blood B cells in TG 2 mice expressed hCD19 at densities 65 lower than human blood B cells.

Further comparisons of the relative densities of hCD19 and mCD19 expression in B cells from TG 1 mouse tissues are shown in in histograms showing the mean fluorescence intensities MFI SEM of anti CD19 antibody staining for B cells from bone marrow blood spleen lymph node and PL for hCD19 left and mCD19 right . The results demonstrate that in TG 1 mice hCD19 was expressed at increasing levels by B220 cells in the bone marrow 63 of human blood levels 

To determine whether mouse anti hCD19 antibodies that bind to human CD19 of the IgG1 HB12a HB12b B4 IgG2a FMC63 and IgG2b HD237 isotypes react differently blood and spleen B220 B cells were isolated from TG 1 mice. The isolated cells were contacted in vitro with the above mentioned anti CD19 antibodies and assessed for their ability to bind human CD19 expressing transgenic mouse hCD19TG B cells using monoclonal antibody staining which was visualized using isotype specific PE conjugated secondary antibodies with flow cytometry analysis.

The results are shown in in graphs of the fluorescence intensity x axis versus the relative B cell number y axis for IgG2b murine isotype IgG2a murine isotype and IgG1 murine isotype anti CD19 antibodies at 5 g mL. The fluorescence intensity of B220 cells stained with anti CD19 antibody are shown as solid lines and the fluorescence intensity of the isotype matched control CTL is shown as a dashed line. Each antibody reached saturating levels of reactivity with spleen B cells at a concentration of 5 g mL. The results demonstrate that anti CD19 antibody binding density on mouse blood and spleen B220 B cells from TG 1 mice is uniform for the antibody isotypes tested and for both blood and spleen B cells.

To determine whether mean fluorescence intensities were independent of anti CD19 antibody isotype the binding activity of individual anti CD19 antibodies at 5 g mL was assessed by staining a mouse pre B cell line 300.19 transfected with a hCD19 cDNA using the same anti mouse Ig secondary antibody. Antibody staining MFI SEM was visualized using mouse Ig specific PE conjugated secondary antibody with flow cytometry analysis. The results are shown in in a histogram of anti CD19 antibody binding as shown by staining intensity y axis to hCD19 cDNA transfected 300.19 cells for HB12a HB12b B4 FMC63 HD237 anti CD19 antibodies and a control antibody CTL . Each antibody stained cells with characteristic mean fluorescence intensities that were independent of anti CD19 antibody isotype with HB12b showing the lowest levels of staining and HD237 demonstrating the highest. Thus the results shown demonstrate that 300.19 cells are a model in vitro system for the comparison of the ability of anti CD19 antibodies to bind CD19 in vitro.

Thus taken together the results shown in demonstrate that hCD19TG mice and the 300.19 cells represent appropriate in vitro and in vivo model systems for assessing the ability of anti hCD19 antibodies to bind B cells when hCD19 is expressed over a range of densities.

Mouse anti CD19 antibodies that bind to human CD19 were assessed for their ability to deplete hCD19TG TG 1 blood spleen and lymph node B cells in vivo. Each antibody was given to mice at either 250 or 50 g mouse a single dose about 10 to 50 fold lower than the 375 mg mdose primarily given four times for anti CD20 therapy in humans Maloney et al. 15 3266 74 1997 and McLaughlin et al. 12 1763 9 1998 .

The results are shown in in a plot of B cell amount 7 days following CD19 or isotype matched control CTL treatment with HB12a HB12b or FMC63 anti CD19 antibodies or a control. Separate plots are provided for lymph nodes spleen and blood tissues for each anti CD19 antibody. The percentage of gated lymphocytes depleted at 7 days shown on each plot demonstrates representative B cell depletion from blood spleen and lymph nodes of TG 1 mice as determined by immunofluorescence staining with flow cytometry analysis. shows mean numbers SEM per ml of B220 blood B cells following treatment with anti CD19 closed circles or isotype control open circles antibodies. The value shown after time 0 represents data obtained at 1 hour. and show spleen and lymph node B cell numbers SEM respectively after treatment of TG 1 mice with anti CD19 filled bars or control open bars antibody at the indicated doses. In significant differences between mean results for anti CD19 or isotype control antibody treated mice 3 mice per data point are indicated p

Each antibody depleted the majority of circulating B cells within one hour of treatment with potent depleting effects on spleen and lymph node B cell frequencies and numbers by day seven. The HB12a antibody depleted 98 of blood B cells and 90 95 of splenic and lymph node B cells by day seven. Similarly the HB12b B4 FMC63 and HD237 antibodies depleted 99 96 99 and 97 of blood B cells respectively. The HB12b B4 FMC63 and HD237 antibodies depleted 88 93 64 85 72 95 and 88 90 of splenic and lymph node B cells respectively. The few remaining peripheral B cells primarily represented phenotypically immature cells that were potential emigrants from the bone marrow. None of the CD19 antibodies had significant effects when given to WT mice and isotype matched control antibodies given under identical conditions did not affect B cell numbers . Thus anti hCD19 antibodies effectively depleted B cells from the circulation spleen and lymph nodes of hCD19TG mice by day seven. A summary of B cell depletion in TG 1 mice is provided in Table 1.

Known anti CD19 antibodies were tested in hCD19TG mice to determine whether such antibodies were effective in depleting B cells from various bodily fluids and tissues. The assays described herein can be used to determine whether other anti CD19 antibodies for example anti CD19 antibodies that bind to specific portions of the human CD19 antigen will effectively deplete B cells. The results using anti CD19 antibodies identified as capable of depleting B cells can be correlated to use in humans. Antibodies with properties of the identified antibodies can be used in the compositions and methods of the invention for the treatment of B cell malignancies in humans. depict bone marrow B cell depletion following CD19 antibody treatment.

Peritoneal cavity B cells in TG 1 mice express hCD19 at higher levels than other tissue B cells and primarily due to the presence of CD5IgMB220B1 cells that expressed hCD19 at approximately 25 higher densities than the CD5IgMB220subset of conventional B2 B cells . demonstrate that peritoneal cavity B cells are sensitive to anti CD19 antibody treatment.

In order to determine whether HB12a and HB12b anti CD19 antibodies are distinct from known anti CD19 antibodies the amino acid sequence of each anti CD19 antibody variable region used herein was analyzed A and B A and B .

Since each anti CD19 antibody examined in this study depleted significant numbers of B cells in vivo the amino acid sequence of each anti CD19 antibody variable region was assessed to determine whether these antibodies differ in sequence and potentially bind to different CD19 epitopes. Antibodies bind target antigens through molecular interactions that are mediated by specific amino acids within the variable regions of each antibody molecule. Thus complex interactions between protein antigens and the antibodies that bind to specific epitopes on these antigens are almost unique to each antibody and its specific amino acid sequence. This level of complexity in antigen and antibody interactions is a reflection of a diverse antibody repertoire to most protein antigens. While antibody interactions with target antigens are primarily mediated by amino acids within complementarity determining regions CDR of antibody molecules framework amino acids are also critical to antigen binding activity. Thus structurally similar antibodies are likely to bind to the same antigens or region of a target molecule while structurally dissimilar antibodies with different V and CDR regions are likely to interact with different regions of antigens through different molecular interactions.

Since antibodies that interact with and bind to the same molecular region or epitope of a target antigen are structurally similar by definition the amino acid sequences of HB12a HB12b FMC63 and other published anti CD19 antibodies were compared including the HD37 Kipriyanov et al. 196 51 62 1996 Le Gall et al. 453 164 168 1999 2G7 Meeker et al. 3 305 320 1984 Brandl et al. 27 1264 1270 1999 and B43 Bejcek et al. 55 2346 2351 1995 antibodies. The heavy chains of the anti CD19 antibodies were generated through different combinations of V D J gene segments with the V regions derived from the V1S39 V1S56 V1S136 or V2S1 gene segments D regions derived from FL16.1 gene segments and J regions derived from either J2 or J4 gene segments Table 2 . The published heavy and light chain variable regions of the B43 and HD37 antibodies were virtually identical in amino acid sequence . This level of conservation reflects the fact that each of these antibodies is also remarkably similar at the nucleotide level having identical V D Jand VJjunctions with most differences accounted for by the use of redundant primers to PCR amplify each cDNA sequence. This indicates that the HD37 and B43 and antibodies share a common if not identical origin and therefore bind to identical epitopes on the CD19 protein. The HB12a and 4G7 antibodies were also distinct from other anti CD19 antibodies. Although the heavy chain regions of the HB12a and 4G7 antibodies were similar and are likely to have derived from the same germline V D Jgene segments different junctional borders were used for D Jassembly . The HB12b antibody utilized a distinct Vgene segment Table 2 and had distinctly different CDR3 sequences from the other anti CD19 antibodies. The FMC63 antibody also had a very distinct amino acid sequence from the other anti CD19 antibodies.

As shown in the HB12a HB12b FMC63 4G7 and HD37 B43 antibodies each utilize distinct light chain genes . Light chains were generated from multiple V and J gene segments. The lack of homogeneity among these six anti CD19 antibodies H and L chain sequences suggests that these antibodies bind to several distinct sites on human CD19. A comparison of amino acid sequences of paired heavy and light chains further indicates that most of these anti CD19 antibodies are structurally distinct and will therefore bind human CD19 through different molecular interactions. Thus the ability of anti CD19 antibodies to deplete B cells in vivo is not restricted to a limited number of antibodies that bind CD19 at identical sites but is a general property of anti CD19 antibodies as a class.

To determine whether an anti CD19 antibody s ability to deplete B cells is dependent on CD19 density the HB12b and FMC63 anti CD19 antibodies were administered to mice having varying levels of CD19 expression. The results demonstrate that human CD19 density on B cells and antibody isotype can influence the depletion of B cells in the presence of an anti CD19 antibody. The same assay can be used to determine whether other anti CD19 antibodies can effectively deplete B cells and the results can be correlated to treatment of human patients with varying levels of CD19 expression. Thus the methods for examining CD19 presence and density in human subjects described herein can be used to identify patients or patient populations for which certain anti CD19 antibodies can deplete B cells and or to determine suitable dosages.

The results presented above indicate that although all five anti CD19 antibodies tested were similarly effective in TG 1 mice when used at 250 or 50 g the extent of B cell depletion for B cells from blood bone marrow and spleen appeared to correlate with antibody isotype IgG2a IgG1 IgG2b . Therefore the effectiveness of the HB12b IgG1 and FMC63 IgG2a antibodies was compared in homozygous TG 1 heterozygous TG 1 and homozygous TG 2 mice that express CD19 at different densities .

To determine whether CD19 density influences the effectiveness of anti CD19 antibody induced B cell depletion representative blood and spleen B cell depletion was examined in hCD19TG mice after HB12b or FMC63 antibody treatment 7 days 250 g mouse . Numbers indicate the percentage of gated B220 lymphocytes. Bar graphs indicate numbers SEM of blood per mL or spleen total number B cells following treatment with anti CD19 antibodies closed bars or isotype control open bars antibodies. Significant differences between mean results for anti CD19 antibody or isotype control antibody treated mice 3 mice per data point are indicated p

The results presented in demonstrate that CD19 density influences the efficiency of B cell depletion by anti CD19 antibodies in vivo. Low level CD19 expression in TG 2 mice had a marked influence on circulating or tissue B cell depletion by the HB12b antibody on day seven . Differences in CD19 expression by TG 1 TG 1 and TG 2 mice also influenced circulating and tissue B cell depletion by the FMC63 antibody but did not significantly alter circulating B cell depletion .

To further verify that CD19 density is an important factor in CD19 mAb mediated B cell depletion the relative depletion rates of CD19TG 1 and CD19TG 2 B cells were compared directly. Splenocytes from CD19TG 1 and CD19TG 2 mice were differentially labeled with CFSE by labeling unfractionated splenocytes from hCD19TG 1 and hCD19TG 2 mice were labeled with 0.1 and 0.01 M Vybrant CFDA SE CFSE Molecular Probes respectively according to the manufacture s instructions. The relative frequency of B220 cells among CFSE labeled splenocytes was determined by immunofluorescence staining with flow cytometry analysis. Subsequently equal numbers of CFSE labeled B220 hCD19TG 1 and hCD19TG 2 splenocytes 2.5 10 were injected into the peritoneal cavity of three wild type B6 mice. After 1 hour the mice were given either FMC63 or control mAb 2501.p. . After 24 hours the labeled lymphocytes were recovered with the relative frequencies of CFSE labeled B220 and B220 cells assessed by flow cytometry. The gates in each histogram in indicate the frequencies of B220 cells within the CD19TG 1 CFSE and CD19TG 2 CFSE splenocyte populations. The bar graph indicates the number of CFSE labeled cell population present in anti CD19 mAb treated mice relative to control mAb treated mice. Results represent hCD19TG 1 splenocytes filled bars and hCD19TG 2 splenocytes open bars transferred into 3 wild type recipient mice with significant differences between sample means SEM indicated p

B cell clearance was assessed 24 hours after anti CD19 or control mAb treatment of individual mice. CD19TG 1 B220 B cells were depleted at significantly faster rates p

The following assays were used to determine whether B cell depletion by an anti CD19 antibody was dependent on Fc R expression. Through a process of interbreeding hCD19 g with mice lacking expression of certain Fc R mice were generated that expressed hCD19 and lacked expression of certain Fc R. Such mice were used in assays to assess the ability of anti CD19 antibodies to deplete B cells through pathways that involve Fc R expression e.g. ADCC. Thus anti CD19 antibodies identified in these assays can be used to engineer chimeric human or humanized anti CD19 antibodies using the techniques described above. Such antibodies can in turn be used in the compositions and methods of the invention for the treatment of B cell malignanices in humans.

The innate immune system mediates B cell depletion following anti CD20 antibody treatment through Fc R dependent processes. Mouse effector cells express four different Fc R classes for IgG the high affinity Fc RI CD64 and the low affinity Fc RII CD32 Fc RIII CD16 and Fc RIV molecules. Fc RI Fc RIII and Fc RIV are hetero oligomeric complexes in which the respective ligand binding chains associate with a common chain FcR . FcR chain expression is required for Fc R assembly and for Fc R triggering of effector functions including phagocytosis by macrophages. Since FcR mice lack high affinity Fc RI CD64 and low affinity Fc RIII CD16 and Fc RIV molecules FcR mice expressing hCD19 were used to assess the role of Fc R in tissue B cell depletion following anti CD19 antibody treatment. shows representative blood and spleen B cell depletion seven days after anti CD19 or isotype control antibody treatment of FcR or FcR littermates. Numbers indicate the percentage of B220 lymphocytes within the indicated gates. shows blood and tissue B cell depletion seven days after antibody treatment of FcR littermates on day zero. For blood the value shown after time zero represents data obtained at 1 hour. Bar graphs represent mean B220 B cell numbers SEM after anti CD19 filled bars or isotype control open bars antibody treatment of mice 3 mice per group . Significant differences between mean results for anti CD19 or isotype control antibody treated mice are indicated p

The results presented in show B cell depletion following anti CD19 antibody treatment is FcR and monocyte dependent. Mice rendered macrophage deficient by treatment with liposome encapsulated clodronate did not significantly deplete circulating B cells 1 day after FMC63 anti CD20 MB20 11 or control anti CD19 antibody treatment while FMC63 antibody treatment eliminated circulating B cells in mice treated with PBS loaded liposomes . After 4 7 days circulating B cell numbers were significantly depleted by both FMC63 and anti CD20 antibody treatment with anti CD19 antibody treatment having more dramatic effects on B cell numbers in clodronate treated mice. Similarly anti CD19 and anti CD20 antibody treatment decreased bone marrow B220 cell numbers by 55 in clodronate treated mice on day 7 relative to control antibody treated littermates while anti CD19 antibody treatment decreased bone marrow B220 cell numbers by 88 in PBS treated mice. Anti CD19 antibody treatment decreased spleen B cell numbers by 52 in clodronate treated mice on day 7 relative to control antibody treated littermates while anti CD20 antibody depleted B cells minimally and anti CD19 antibody treatment decreased spleen B cell numbers by 89 in PBS treated mice. Both anti CD19 and anti CD20 antibody treatment decreased lymph node B cell numbers by 48 53 in clodronate treated mice on day seven relative to control antibody treated littermates while anti CD19 antibody treatment decreased lymph node B cell numbers by 93 in PBS treated mice. In blood spleen and lymph nodes anti CD19 antibody treatment was significantly less effective in clodronate treated mice than in PBS treated littermates p

In order to assess the efficacy and duration of B cell depletion the hCD19TG mice were administered a single low dose 250 g injection of anti CD19 antibody. demonstrate duration and dose response of B cell depletion following anti CD19 antibody treatment. shows numbers of blood B220 B cells and Thy 1 T cells following FMC63 or isotype control antibody treatment of TG 1 mice on day zero. Values represent mean SEM results from six mice in each group. The results demonstrate that circulating B cells were depleted for 13 weeks with a gradual recovery of blood borne B cells over the ensuing 13 weeks. Thy 1 T cell representation was not altered as a result of anti CD19 treatment.

Whether CD19 internalization influenced B cell depletion in vivo was assessed by comparing cell surface CD19 expression following HB12a HB12b and FMC63 antibody treatment 250 g .

The results demonstrate that CD19 surprisingly exhibited lower levels of internalization than expected following administration of anti CD19 antibodies. In particular the results demonstrate that CD19 unexpectedly persists on the cell surface following binding of an anti CD19 antibody thus the B cell remains accessible to the ADCC activity. These results demonstrate in part why the anti CD19 antibodies and treatment regimens of the invention are efficacious in treating B cell malignancies.

The B cell depletion described in suggested that the administered antibody rapidly saturated available antibody binding sites on hCD19 within 1 hour of administration. To confirm this observation mice were treated with either FMC63 hCD19 binding antibody or isotype control antibody. At various time thereafter blood and spleen B cells were stained with the fluorochrome conjugated B4 antibody to identify unoccupied antibody binding sites on the surface of mCD19 or mCD20 B cells. The frequencies of cells within the upper and lower right quadrants are indicated. Each time point represents results obtained from one mouse. The results indicate FMC63 treatment resulted in a progressive depletion of hCD19 bearing cells over the course of the experiment with blood B cells being depleted more rapidly than spleen. Those B cells remaining at each time point could be identified by their expression of mCD19 or mCD20 but were not stained by B4 suggesting that the administered FMC63 was bound to the remaining B cells. These finding confirm the ability of FMC63 to bind and deplete B cells in vivo. Moreover FMC63 prevents B4 binding suggesting that these antibodies recognize overlapping epitopes on hCD19. The results in confirm that HB12b antibody treatment 250 g also saturates antibody binding sites on hCD19 within 1 hour of administration and results in the depleting of hCD19 positive B cells. Unexpectedly the HB12b antibody did not completely inhibit binding of the B4 antibody suggesting that unlike FMC63 HB12b recognizes an epitope on hCD19 that is distinct from that recognized by B4. The results shown in demonstrate that most anti CD19 antibodies inhibit the binding of most other anti CD19 antibodies indicating that most anti CD19 antibodies bind to similar the same or overlapping regions or epitopes on the CD19 protein. Alternatively these observations may also result from the relatively small size of the CD19 extracellular domain compared with the size of antibody molecules.

The assays described in this example can be used to determine whether an anti CD19 antibody is capable of eliminating or attenuating immune responses. Anti CD19 antibodies identified in these assays can be used to engineer chimeric human or humanized anti CD19 antibodies using the techniques described above. Such antibodies can in turn be used in the compositions and methods of the invention for the treatment of B cell malignancies in humans.

The effect of anti CD19 antibody induced B cell depletion on serum antibody levels was assessed by giving hCD19TGmice a single injection of anti CD19 antibody. shows CD19 antibody treatment reduces serum immunoglobulin levels in TG 1 mice. Two month old littermates were treated with a single injection of FMC63 closed circles or control open circles antibody 250 g on day 0. Antibody levels were determined by ELISA with mean values SEM shown for each group of 5 mice. Differences between CD19 or control mAb treated mice were significant p

Since hCD19TG mice produce detectable autoantibodies after 2 mos of age Sato et al. 157 4371 1996 serum autoantibody binding to ssDNA dsDNA and histones was assessed. shows anti CD19 antibody treatment reduces autoantibody anti dsDNA anti ssDNA and anti histone autoantibody levels after anti CD19 antibody treatment. The results show that anti CD19 antibody treatment significantly reduced serum IgM autoantibody levels after 2 weeks and prevented the generation of isotype switched IgG autoantibodies for up to 10 weeks . Thus B cell depletion substantially reduced acute and long term antibody responses and attenuated class switching of normal and pathogenic immune responses.

The influence of B cell depletion on T cell independent type 1 TI 1 and type 2 TI 2 antibody responses was assessed by immunizing hCD19TG mice with TNP LPS or DNP Ficoll at day zero 7 days after anti CD19 antibody FMC63 or control antibody treatment. Significant hapten specific IgM IgG and IgA antibody responses were not observed in anti CD19 antibody treated mice immunized with either antigen . Antibody responses to the T cell dependent TD Ag DNP KLH were also assessed using mice treated with anti CD19 antibody 7 days before immunization . shows that DNP KLH immunized mice treated with anti CD19 antibody showed reduced humoral immunity. Littermates were treated with FMC63 closed circles or control open circles antibody 250 g seven days before primary immunizations on day zero with serum obtained on the indicated day. For DNP KLH immunizations all mice were challenged with 100 g of DNP KLH on day 21. All values are mean SEM ELISA OD units obtained using sera from five mice of each group. Differences between anti CD19 or control antibody treated mice were significant p

The assay described herein can be used to determine whether other combination or conjugate therapies e.g. anti CD19 antibodies in combination with chemotherapy toxin therapy or radiotherapy have beneficial effects such as an additive or more that additive depletion of B cells. The results of combination therapies tested in animal models can be correlated to humans by means well known in the art.

Anti CD20 antibodies are effective in depleting human and mouse B cells in vivo. Therefore the benefit of simultaneous treatment with anti CD19 FMC63 and anti CD20 MB20 11 antibodies was assessed to determine whether this enhanced B cell depletion. Mice were treated with suboptimal 2 g doses of each antibody individually or a combination of both antibodies at 1 g or with combined 2 g doses. shows the results of TG 1 mice treated with control 250 g FMC63 CD19 2 g MB20 11 CD20 2 g FMC63 MB20 11 1 g each or FMC63 MB20 11 2 g each antibodies on day zero. Blood B cell numbers were measured at time zero one hour and on days one four and seven. Tissue B cell numbers were determined on day seven. Values represent means SEM from groups of three mice. The results shown in demonstrate that simultaneous anti CD19 and anti CD20 antibody treatments are beneficial. B cell depletion in mice treated with a combination of both antibodies at 1 g was intermediate or similar to depletion observed following treatment of mice with 2 g of each individual antibody . However the simultaneous treatment of mice with both antibodies at 2 g lead to significantly more B cell depletion than was observed with either antibody alone. Thus combined anti CD19 and anti CD20 antibody therapies had beneficial effects that enhanced B cell depletion. This likely results from the accumulation of more therapeutically effective antibody molecules on the surface of individual B cells.

The assay described herein can be used to determine whether a subcutaneous route of administration of an anti CD19 antibody can effectively deplete B cells. The results of the efficacy of different delivery routes tested in animal models can be correlated to humans by means well known in the art.

Since anti CD19 antibody given i.v. effectively depletes circulating and tissue B cells it was assessed whether anti CD19 antibody given s.c. or i.p. depleted B cells to an equivalent extent. Wild type mice were treated with the FMC63 antibody at 250 g either subcutaneous s.c. intraperitoneal i.p. or i.v. Values represent mean SEM blood per ml bone marrow spleen lymph node and peritoneal cavity B220 B cell numbers on day seven n 3 as assessed by flow cytometry. Significant differences between mean results for each group of mice are indicated p

Burkitt s lymphoma a B cell malignancy in humans is characterized by translocations of the c myc proto oncogene to Ig gene promoter regions leading to aberrant c Myc over expression. Similarly E cMyc transgenic cMycTG mice in which the c myc proto oncogene is under the control of the Ig heavy chain enhancer develop aggressive B cell derived lymphomas at an early age have about 90 mortality rate by 20 weeks of age and have a median age of survival at about 12 weeks Harris et al. 167 353 1988 and Adams et al. 318 533 1985 . Tumors from c MycTG mice are not restricted to a specific B cell developmental stage but predominantly present with Ig gene rearrangements and phenotypes characteristic of pre B or immature B cells Adams et al. 318 533 1985 . To assess the efficacy of CD19 directed immunotherapy in vivo hCD19TG 1 and cMycTG mice were crossed to generate hCD19TG 1 cMycTG mice that developed aggressive B cell derived lymphomas at an early age. Tumor cells derived from one mouse were isolated expanded in vitro and characterized phenotypically to be hCD19 and mouse CD19 CD20CD43 IgM IgDB220 lymphoblasts which are typical of the pre B immature B cell tumors that develop in c mycTG mice Harris et al. 167 353 1988 and Adams et al. 318 533 1985 . Tumor cells 10 from hCD19TG 1 c mycTG mice were transplanted i.v. into 20 Rag mice on day 0. Equal numbers of randomly selected mice were treated with FMC63 filled circles or control open circles antibody 250 g on days 1 and 7. shows the numbers of circulating tumor cells SEM quantified by flow cytometry over a 6 week period and shows mouse percent survival over a 7 week period. Each value indicates the percentage of viable mice on each day they were examined. The results in demonstrate that anti CD19 antibody treatment prevents hCD19 lymphoma growth in vivo. Transplantation of these tumor cells into twenty Rag mice resulted in the appearance of circulating mouse CD19 and B220 lymphoblasts by 2 weeks in ten randomly selected recipients that were treated with a control mAb with death by 3.5 weeks. By contrast treating ten mice with anti CD19 antibody day 1 and 7 following tumor transplantation prevented the appearance of circulating tumor cells in all 10 recipients for up to 7 weeks. One anti CD19 antibody treated mouse died during blood harvest but never displayed circulating tumor cells. Thus anti CD19 antibody treatment may offer an effective therapy for treating patients with B cell lineage malignancies especially those with tumors that do not express CD20 or express CD20 at low levels.
