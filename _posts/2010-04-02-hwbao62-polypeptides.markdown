title: HWBAO62 polypeptides
abstract: The present invention relates to human secreted polypeptides, and isolated nucleic acid molecules encoding said polypeptides, useful for diagnosing and treating diseases, disorders, and/or conditions (such as immune, cardiovascular, cancer, and other proliferative diseases, disorders, and/or conditions) related to said human secreted proteins. Antibodies that bind these polypeptides are also encompassed by the present invention. Also encompassed by the invention are vectors, host cells, and recombinant and synthetic methods for producing said polynucleotides, polypeptides, and/or antibodies. The invention further encompasses screening methods for identifying agonists and antagonists of polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention. The present invention further encompasses methods and compositions for inhibiting or enhancing the production and function of the polypeptides of the present invention. The invention further relates to diagnostic and therapeutic methods useful for diagnosing and treating diseases, disorders, and/or conditions related to these novel human secreted proteins.
