The present invention relates to compositions including transgenic and knockout animals and methods of using such compositions for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases or disorders.

Extracellular proteins play important roles in among other things the formation differentiation and maintenance of multicellular organisms. The fate of many individual cells e.g. proliferation migration differentiation or interaction with other cells is typically governed by information received from other cells and or the immediate environment. This information is often transmitted by secreted polypeptides for instance mitogenic factors survival factors cytotoxic factors differentiation factors neuropeptides and hormones which are in turn received and interpreted by diverse cell receptors or membrane bound proteins. These secreted polypeptides or signaling molecules normally pass through the cellular secretory pathway to reach their site of action in the extracellular environment.

Secreted proteins have various industrial applications including as pharmaceuticals diagnostics biosensors and bioreactors. Most protein drugs available at present such as thrombolytic agents interferons interleukins erythropoietins colony stimulating factors and various other cytokines are secretory proteins. Their receptors which are membrane proteins also have potential as therapeutic or diagnostic agents. Efforts are being undertaken by both industry and academia to identify new native secreted proteins. Many efforts are focused on the screening of mammalian recombinant DNA libraries to identify the coding sequences for novel secreted proteins. Examples of screening methods and techniques are described in the literature see for example Klein et al. 93 7108 7113 1996 U.S. Pat. No. 5 536 637 .

Membrane bound proteins and receptors can play important roles in among other things the formation differentiation and maintenance of multicellular organisms. The fate of many individual cells e.g. proliferation migration differentiation or interaction with other cells is typically governed by information received from other cells and or the immediate environment. This information is often transmitted by secreted polypeptides for instance mitogenic factors survival factors cytotoxic factors differentiation factors neuropeptides and hormones which are in turn received and interpreted by diverse cell receptors or membrane bound proteins. Such membrane bound proteins and cell receptors include but are not limited to cytokine receptors receptor kinases receptor phosphatases receptors involved in cell cell interactions and cellular adhesion molecules like selectins and integrins. For instance transduction of signals that regulate cell growth and differentiation is regulated in part by phosphorylation of various cellular proteins. Protein tyrosine kinases enzymes that catalyze that process can also act as growth factor receptors. Examples include fibroblast growth factor receptor and nerve growth factor receptor.

Membrane bound proteins and receptor molecules have various industrial applications including as pharmaceutical and diagnostic agents. Receptor immuno adhesions for instance can be employed as therapeutic agents to block receptor ligand interactions. The membrane bound proteins can also be employed for screening of potential peptide or small molecule inhibitors of the relevant receptor ligand interaction.

Efforts are being undertaken by both industry and academia to identify new native receptor or membrane bound proteins. Many efforts are focused on the screening of mammalian recombinant DNA libraries to identify the coding sequences for novel receptor or membrane bound proteins.

Given the importance of secreted and membrane bound proteins in biological and disease processes in vivo studies and characterizations may provide valuable identification and discovery of therapeutics and or treatments useful in the prevention amelioration or correction of diseases or dysfunctions. In this regard genetically engineered mice have proven to be invaluable tools for the functional dissection of biological processes relevant to human disease including immunology cancer neuro biology cardiovascular biology obesity and many others. Gene knockouts can be viewed as modeling the biological mechanism of drug action by presaging the activity of highly specific antagonists in vivo. Knockout mice have been shown to model drug activity phenotypes of mice deficient for specific pharmaceutical target proteins can resemble the human clinical phenotype caused by the corresponding antagonist drug. Gene knockouts enable the discovery of the mechanism of action of the target the predominant physiological role of the target and mechanism based side effects that might result from inhibition of the target in mammals. Examples of this type include mice deficient in the angiotensin converting enzyme ACE Esther C. R. et al. 74 953 965 1996 and cyclooxygenase 1 COX1 genes Langenbach R. et al. 83 483 492 1995 . Conversely knocking the gene out in the mouse can have an opposite phenotypic effect to that observed in humans after administration of an agonist drug to the corresponding target. Examples include the erythropoietin knockout Wu C. S. et al. 83 59 67 1996 in which a consequence of the mutation is deficient red blood cell production and the GABA A R 3 knockout DeLorey T. M. 18 8505 8514 1998 in which the mutant mice show hyperactivity and hyper responsiveness. Both these phenotypes are opposite to the effects of erythropoietin and benzodiazepine administration in humans. A striking example of a target validated using mouse genetics is the ACC2 gene. Although the human ACC2 gene had been identified several years ago interest in ACC2 as a target for drug development was stimulated only recently after analysis of ACC2 function using a knockout mouse. ACC2 mutant mice eat more than their wild type littermates yet burn more fat and store less fat in their adipocytes making this enzyme a probable target for chemical antagonism in the treatment of obesity Abu Elheiga L. et al. 291 2613 2616 2001 .

In the instant application mutated gene disruptions have resulted in phenotypic observations related to various disease conditions or dysfunctions including CNS neurological disturbances or disorders such as anxiety eye abnormalities and associated diseases cardiovascular endothelial or angiogenic disorders including atherosclerosis abnormal metabolic disorders including diabetes and dyslipidemias associated with elevated serum triglycerides and cholesterol levels immunological and inflammatory disorders oncological disorders bone metabolic abnormalities or disorders such as arthritis osteoporosis and osteopetrosis or a developmental disease such as embryonic lethality.

The terms PRO polypeptide and PRO as used herein and when immediately followed by a numerical designation refer to various polypeptides wherein the complete designation i.e. PRO number refers to specific polypeptide sequences as described herein. The terms PRO number polypeptide and PRO number wherein the term number is provided as an actual numerical designation as used herein encompass native sequence polypeptides and polypeptide variants which are further defined herein . The PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides described herein may be isolated from a variety of sources such as from human tissue types or from another source or prepared by recombinant or synthetic methods. The term PRO polypeptide refers to each individual PRO number polypeptide disclosed herein. All disclosures in this specification which refer to the PRO polypeptide refer to each of the polypeptides individually as well as jointly. For example descriptions of the preparation of purification of derivation of formation of antibodies to or against administration of compositions containing treatment of a disease with etc. pertain to each polypeptide of the invention individually. The term PRO polypeptide also includes variants of the PRO number polypeptides disclosed herein.

A native sequence PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide comprises a polypeptide having the same amino acid sequence as the corresponding PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide derived from nature. Such native sequence PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides can be isolated from nature or can be produced by recombinant or synthetic means. The term native sequence PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide specifically encompasses naturally occurring truncated or secreted forms of the specific PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide e.g. an extracellular domain sequence naturally occurring variant forms e.g. alternatively spliced forms and naturally occurring allelic variants of the polypeptide. The invention provides native sequence PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides disclosed herein which are mature or full length native sequence polypeptides comprising the full length amino acids sequences shown in the accompanying figures. Start and stop codons are shown in bold font and underlined in the figures. However while the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide disclosed in the accompanying figures are shown to begin with methionine residues designated herein as amino acid position 1 in the figures it is conceivable and possible that other methionine residues located either upstream or downstream from the amino acid position 1 in the figures may be employed as the starting amino acid residue for the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides.

The PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide extracellular domain or ECD refers to a form of the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide which is essentially free of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Ordinarily a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide ECD will have less than 1 of such transmembrane and or cytoplasmic domains and preferably will have less than 0.5 of such domains. It will be understood that any transmembrane domains identified for the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides of the present invention are identified pursuant to criteria routinely employed in the art for identifying that type of hydrophobic domain. The exact boundaries of a transmembrane domain may vary but most likely by no more than about 5 amino acids at either end of the domain as initially identified herein. Optionally therefore an extracellular domain of a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide may contain from about 5 or fewer amino acids on either side of the transmembrane domain extracellular domain boundary as identified in the Examples or specification and such polypeptides with or without the associated signal peptide and nucleic acid encoding them are contemplated by the present invention.

The approximate location of the signal peptides of the various PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides disclosed herein are shown in the present specification and or the accompanying figures. It is noted however that the C terminal boundary of a signal peptide may vary but most likely by no more than about 5 amino acids on either side of the signal peptide C terminal boundary as initially identified herein wherein the C terminal boundary of the signal peptide may be identified pursuant to criteria routinely employed in the art for identifying that type of amino acid sequence element e.g. Nielsen et al. 10 1 6 1997 and von Heinje et al. 14 4683 4690 1986 . Moreover it is also recognized that in some cases cleavage of a signal sequence from a secreted polypeptide is not entirely uniform resulting in more than one secreted species. These mature polypeptides where the signal peptide is cleaved within no more than about 5 amino acids on either side of the C terminal boundary of the signal peptide as identified herein and the polynucleotides encoding them are contemplated by the present invention.

 PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide variant means a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide preferably an active PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide as defined herein having at least about 80 amino acid sequence identity with a full length native sequence PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide sequence as disclosed herein a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide sequence lacking the signal peptide as disclosed herein an extracellular domain of a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide with or without the signal peptide as disclosed herein or any other fragment of a full length PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide sequence as disclosed herein such as those encoded by a nucleic acid that represents only a portion of the complete coding sequence for a full length PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide . Such PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide variants include for instance PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides wherein one or more amino acid residues are added or deleted at the N or C terminus of the full length native amino acid sequence. Ordinarily a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide variant will have or will have at least about 80 amino acid sequence identity alternatively will have or will have at least about 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 or 99 amino acid sequence identity to a full length native sequence PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide sequence as disclosed herein a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide sequence lacking the signal peptide as disclosed herein an extracellular domain of a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide with or without the signal peptide as disclosed herein or any other specifically defined fragment of a full length PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide sequence as disclosed herein. Ordinarily PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 variant polypeptides are or are at least about 10 amino acids in length alternatively are or are at least about 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 150 160 170 180 190 200 210 220 230 240 250 260 270 280 290 300 310 320 330 340 350 360 370 380 390 400 410 420 430 440 450 460 470 480 490 500 510 520 530 540 550 560 570 580 590 600 amino acids in length or more. Optionally PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 variant polypeptides will have no more than one conservative amino acid substitution as compared to the native PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide sequence alternatively will have or will have no more than 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 or 10 conservative amino acid substitution as compared to the native PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide sequence.

 Percent amino acid sequence identity with respect to the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide sequences identified herein is defined as the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues in the specific PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide sequence after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps if necessary to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art for instance using publicly available computer software such as BLAST BLAST 2 ALIGN or Megalign DNASTAR software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for measuring alignment including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full length of the sequences being compared. For purposes herein however amino acid sequence identity values are generated using the sequence comparison computer program ALIGN 2 wherein the complete source code for the ALIGN 2 program is provided in Table 1 below. The ALIGN 2 sequence comparison computer program was authored by Genentech Inc. and the source code shown in Table 1 below has been filed with user documentation in the U.S. Copyright Office Washington D.C. 20559 where it is registered under U.S. Copyright Registration No. TXU510087. The ALIGN 2 program is publicly available through Genentech Inc. South San Francisco Calif. or may be compiled from the source code provided in Table 1 below. The ALIGN 2 program should be compiled for use on a UNIX operating system preferably digital UNIX V4.0D. All sequence comparison parameters are set by the ALIGN 2 program and do not vary.

In situations where ALIGN 2 is employed for amino acid sequence comparisons the amino acid sequence identity of a given amino acid sequence A to with or against a given amino acid sequence B which can alternatively be phrased as a given amino acid sequence A that has or comprises a certain amino acid sequence identity to with or against a given amino acid sequence B is calculated as follows 100 times the fraction X Y where X is the number of amino acid residues scored as identical matches by the sequence alignment program ALIGN 2 in that program s alignment of A and B and where Y is the total number of amino acid residues in B. It will be appreciated that where the length of amino acid sequence A is not equal to the length of amino acid sequence B the amino acid sequence identity of A to B will not equal the amino acid sequence identity of B to A. As examples of amino acid sequence identity calculations using this method Tables 2 and 3 demonstrate how to calculate the amino acid sequence identity of the amino acid sequence designated Comparison Protein to the amino acid sequence designated PRO wherein PRO represents the amino acid sequence of a hypothetical PRO polypeptide of interest Comparison Protein represents the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide against which the PRO polypeptide of interest is being compared and X Y and Z each represent different hypothetical amino acid residues. Unless specifically stated otherwise all amino acid sequence identity values used herein are obtained as described in the immediately preceding paragraph using the ALIGN 2 computer program.

In situations where ALIGN 2 is employed for nucleic acid sequence comparisons the nucleic acid sequence identity of a given nucleic acid sequence C to with or against a given nucleic acid sequence D which can alternatively be phrased as a given nucleic acid sequence C that has or comprises a certain nucleic acid sequence identity to with or against a given nucleic acid sequence D is calculated as follows 100 times the fraction W Z where W is the number of nucleotides scored as identical matches by the sequence alignment program ALIGN 2 in that program s alignment of C and D and where Z is the total number of nucleotides in D. It will be appreciated that where the length of nucleic acid sequence C is not equal to the length of nucleic acid sequence D the nucleic acid sequence identity of C to D will not equal the nucleic acid sequence identity of D to C. As examples of nucleic acid sequence identity calculations Tables 4 and 5 demonstrate how to calculate the nucleic acid sequence identity of the nucleic acid sequence designated Comparison DNA to the nucleic acid sequence designated PRO DNA wherein PRO DNA represents a hypothetical PRO encoding nucleic acid sequence of interest Comparison DNA represents the nucleotide sequence of a nucleic acid molecule against which the PRO DNA nucleic acid molecule of interest is being compared and N L and V each represent different hypothetical nucleotides. Unless specifically stated otherwise all nucleic acid sequence identity values used herein are obtained as described in the immediately preceding paragraph using the ALIGN 2 computer program.

The term full length coding region when used in reference to a nucleic acid encoding a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide refers to the sequence of nucleotides which encode the full length PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide of the invention which is often shown between start and stop codons inclusive thereof in the accompanying figures . The term full length coding region when used in reference to an ATCC deposited nucleic acid refers to the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide encoding portion of the cDNA that is inserted into the vector deposited with the ATCC which is often shown between start and stop codons inclusive thereof in the accompanying figures .

 Isolated when used to describe the various polypeptides disclosed herein means polypeptide that has been identified and separated and or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials that would typically interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the polypeptide and may include enzymes hormones and other proteinaceous or non proteinaceous solutes. The invention provides that the polypeptide will be purified 1 to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator or 2 to homogeneity by SDS PAGE under non reducing or reducing conditions using Coomassie blue or preferably silver stain. Isolated polypeptide includes polypeptide in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily however isolated polypeptide will be prepared by at least one purification step.

An isolated PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide encoding nucleic acid or other polypeptide encoding nucleic acid is a nucleic acid molecule that is identified and separated from at least one contaminant nucleic acid molecule with which it is ordinarily associated in the natural source of the polypeptide encoding nucleic acid. An isolated polypeptide encoding nucleic acid molecule is other than in the form or setting in which it is found in nature. Isolated polypeptide encoding nucleic acid molecules therefore are distinguished from the specific polypeptide encoding nucleic acid molecule as it exists in natural cells. However an isolated polypeptide encoding nucleic acid molecule includes polypeptide encoding nucleic acid molecules contained in cells that ordinarily express the polypeptide where for example the nucleic acid molecule is in a chromosomal location different from that of natural cells.

The term control sequences refers to DNA sequences necessary for the expression of an operably linked coding sequence in a particular host organism. The control sequences that are suitable for prokaryotes for example include a promoter optionally an operator sequence and a ribosome binding site. Eukaryotic cells are known to utilize promoters polyadenylation signals and enhancers.

Nucleic acid is operably linked when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example DNA for a presequence or secretory leader is operably linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation. Generally operably linked means that the DNA sequences being linked are contiguous and in the case of a secretory leader contiguous and in reading phase. However enhancers do not have to be contiguous. Linking is accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist the synthetic oligonucleotide adaptors or linkers are used in accordance with conventional practice.

 Stringency of hybridization reactions is readily determinable by one of ordinary skill in the art and generally is an empirical calculation dependent upon probe length washing temperature and salt concentration. In general longer probes require higher temperatures for proper annealing while shorter probes need lower temperatures. Hybridization generally depends on the ability of denatured DNA to reanneal when complementary strands are present in an environment below their melting temperature. The higher the degree of desired homology between the probe and hybridizable sequence the higher the relative temperature which can be used. As a result it follows that higher relative temperatures would tend to make the reaction conditions more stringent while lower temperatures less so. For additional details and explanation of stringency of hybridization reactions see Ausubel et al. Wiley Interscience Publishers 1995 .

 Stringent conditions or high stringency conditions as defined herein may be identified by those that 1 employ low ionic strength and high temperature for washing for example 0.015 M sodium chloride 0.0015 M sodium citrate 0.1 sodium dodecyl sulfate at 50 C. 2 employ during hybridization a denaturing agent such as formamide for example 50 v v formamide with 0.1 bovine serum albumin 0.1 Ficoll 0.1 polyvinylpyrrolidone 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.5 with 750 mM sodium chloride 75 mM sodium citrate at 42 C. or 3 employ 50 formamide 5 SSC 0.75 M NaCl 0.075 M sodium citrate 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 6.8 0.1 sodium pyrophosphate 5 Denhardt s solution sonicated salmon sperm DNA 50 g ml 0.1 SDS and 10 dextran sulfate at 42 C. with washes at 42 C. in 0.2 SSC sodium chloride sodium citrate and 50 formamide at 55 C. followed by a high stringency wash consisting of 0.1 SSC containing EDTA at 55 C.

 Moderately stringent conditions may be identified as described by Sambrook et al. New York Cold Spring Harbor Press 1989 and include the use of washing solution and hybridization conditions e.g. temperature ionic strength and SDS less stringent that those described above. An example of moderately stringent conditions is overnight incubation at 37 C. in a solution comprising 20 formamide 5 SSC 150 mM NaCl 15 mM trisodium citrate 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.6 5 Denhardt s solution 10 dextran sulfate and 20 mg ml denatured sheared salmon sperm DNA followed by washing the filters in 1 SSC at about 37 50 C. The skilled artisan will recognize how to adjust the temperature ionic strength etc. as necessary to accommodate factors such as probe length and the like.

The term epitope tagged when used herein refers to a chimeric polypeptide comprising a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide fused to a tag polypeptide . The tag polypeptide has enough residues to provide an epitope against which an antibody can be made yet is short enough such that it does not interfere with activity of the polypeptide to which it is fused. The tag polypeptide preferably also is fairly unique so that the antibody does not substantially cross react with other epitopes.

The phrases cardiovascular endothelial and angiogenic disorder cardiovascular endothelial and angiogenic dysfunction cardiovascular endothelial or angiogenic disorder and cardiovascular endothelial or angiogenic dysfunction are used interchangeably and refer in part to systemic disorders that affect vessels such as diabetes mellitus as well as diseases of the vessels themselves such as of the arteries capillaries veins and or lymphatics. This would include indications that stimulate angiogenesis and or cardiovascularization and those that inhibit angiogenesis and or cardiovascularization. Such disorders include for example arterial disease such as atherosclerosis hypertension inflammatory vasculitides Reynaud s disease and Reynaud s phenomenon aneurysms and arterial restenosis venous and lymphatic disorders such as thrombophlebitis lymphangitis and lymphedema and other vascular disorders such as peripheral vascular disease cancer such as vascular tumors e.g. hemangioma capillary and cavernous glomus tumors telangiectasia bacillary angiomatosis hemangioendothelioma angiosarcoma haemangiopericytoma Kaposi s sarcoma lymphangioma and lymphangiosarcoma tumor angiogenesis trauma such as wounds burns and other injured tissue implant fixation scarring ischemia reperfusion injury rheumatoid arthritis cerebrovascular disease renal diseases such as acute renal failure or osteoporosis. This would also include angina myocardial infarctions such as acute myocardial infarctions cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure such as CHF.

 Hypertrophy as used herein is defined as an increase in mass of an organ or structure independent of natural growth that does not involve tumor formation. Hypertrophy of an organ or tissue is due either to an increase in the mass of the individual cells true hypertrophy or to an increase in the number of cells making up the tissue hyperplasia or both. Certain organs such as the heart lose the ability to divide shortly after birth. Accordingly cardiac hypertrophy is defined as an increase in mass of the heart which in adults is characterized by an increase in myocyte cell size and contractile protein content without concomitant cell division. The character of the stress responsible for inciting the hypertrophy e.g. increased preload increased afterload loss of myocytes as in myocardial infarction or primary depression of contractility appears to play a critical role in determining the nature of the response. The early stage of cardiac hypertrophy is usually characterized morphologically by increases in the size of myofibrils and mitochondria as well as by enlargement of mitochondria and nuclei. At this stage while muscle cells are larger than normal cellular organization is largely preserved. At a more advanced stage of cardiac hypertrophy there are preferential increases in the size or number of specific organelles such as mitochondria and new contractile elements are added in localized areas of the cells in an irregular manner. Cells subjected to long standing hypertrophy show more obvious disruptions in cellular organization including markedly enlarged nuclei with highly lobulated membranes which displace adjacent myofibrils and cause breakdown of normal Z band registration. The phrase cardiac hypertrophy is used to include all stages of the progression of this condition characterized by various degrees of structural damage of the heart muscle regardless of the underlying cardiac disorder. Hence the term also includes physiological conditions instrumental in the development of cardiac hypertrophy such as elevated blood pressure aortic stenosis or myocardial infarction.

 Heart failure refers to an abnormality of cardiac function where the heart does not pump blood at the rate needed for the requirements of metabolizing tissues. The heart failure can be caused by a number of factors including ischemic congenital rheumatic or idiopathic forms.

 Congestive heart failure CHF is a progressive pathologic state where the heart is increasingly unable to supply adequate cardiac output the volume of blood pumped by the heart over time to deliver the oxygenated blood to peripheral tissues. As CHF progresses structural and hemodynamic damages occur. While these damages have a variety of manifestations one characteristic symptom is ventricular hypertrophy. CHF is a common end result of a number of various cardiac disorders.

 Myocardial infarction generally results from atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries often with superimposed coronary thrombosis. It may be divided into two major types transmural infarcts in which myocardial necrosis involves the full thickness of the ventricular wall and subendocardial nontransmural infarcts in which the necrosis involves the subendocardium the intramural myocardium or both without extending all the way through the ventricular wall to the epicardium. Myocardial infarction is known to cause both a change in hemodynamic effects and an alteration in structure in the damaged and healthy zones of the heart. Thus for example myocardial infarction reduces the maximum cardiac output and the stroke volume of the heart. Also associated with myocardial infarction is a stimulation of the DNA synthesis occurring in the interstice as well as an increase in the formation of collagen in the areas of the heart not affected.

As a result of the increased stress or strain placed on the heart in prolonged hypertension due for example to the increased total peripheral resistance cardiac hypertrophy has long been associated with hypertension . A characteristic of the ventricle that becomes hypertrophic as a result of chronic pressure overload is an impaired diastolic performance. Fouad et al. 4 1500 1506 1984 Smith et al. 5 869 874 1985 . A prolonged left ventricular relaxation has been detected in early essential hypertension in spite of normal or supranormal systolic function. Hartford et al. 6 329 338 1984 . However there is no close parallelism between blood pressure levels and cardiac hypertrophy. Although improvement in left ventricular function in response to antihypertensive therapy has been reported in humans patients variously treated with a diuretic hydrochlorothiazide a blocker propranolol or a calcium channel blocker diltiazem have shown reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy without improvement in diastolic function. Inouye et al. 53 1583 7 1984 .

Another complex cardiac disease associated with cardiac hypertrophy is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy . This condition is characterized by a great diversity of morphologic functional and clinical features Maron et al. 316 780 789 1987 Spirito et al. 320 749 755 1989 Louie and Edwards 36 275 308 1994 Wigle et al. 92 1680 1692 1995 the heterogeneity of which is accentuated by the fact that it afflicts patients of all ages. Spirito et al. 336 775 785 1997 . The causative factors of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are also diverse and little understood. In general mutations in genes encoding sarcomeric proteins are associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Recent data suggest that myosin heavy chain mutations may account for approximately 30 to 40 percent of cases of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Watkins et al. 326 1108 1114 1992 Schwartz et al 91 532 540 1995 Marian and Roberts 92 1336 1347 1995 Thierfelder et al. 77 701 712 1994 Watkins et al. 11 434 437 1995 . Besides myosin heavy chain other locations of genetic mutations include cardiac troponin T alpha topomyosin cardiac myosin binding protein C essential myosin light chain and regulatory myosin light chain. See Malik and Watkins 12 295 302 1997 .

Supravalvular aortic stenosis is an inherited vascular disorder characterized by narrowing of the ascending aorta but other arteries including the pulmonary arteries may also be affected. Untreated aortic stenosis may lead to increased intracardiac pressure resulting in myocardial hypertrophy and eventually heart failure and death. The pathogenesis of this disorder is not fully understood but hypertrophy and possibly hyperplasia of medial smooth muscle are prominent features of this disorder. It has been reported that molecular variants of the elastin gene are involved in the development and pathogenesis of aortic stenosis. U.S. Pat. No. 5 650 282 issued Jul. 22 1997.

 Valvular regurgitation occurs as a result of heart diseases resulting in disorders of the cardiac valves. Various diseases like rheumatic fever can cause the shrinking or pulling apart of the valve orifice while other diseases may result in endocarditis an inflammation of the endocardium or lining membrane of the atrioventricular orifices and operation of the heart. Defects such as the narrowing of the valve stenosis or the defective closing of the valve result in an accumulation of blood in the heart cavity or regurgitation of blood past the valve. If uncorrected prolonged valvular stenosis or insufficiency may result in cardiac hypertrophy and associated damage to the heart muscle which may eventually necessitate valve replacement.

The term immunoglobulin Ig is used interchangeable with antibody herein.

An isolated antibody is one which has been identified and separated and or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody and may include enzymes hormones and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. The invention provides that the antibody will be purified 1 to greater than 95 by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method and most preferably more than 99 by weight 2 to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator or 3 to homogeneity by SDS PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions using Coomassie blue or preferably silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody s natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily however isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.

The basic 4 chain antibody unit is a heterotetrameric glycoprotein composed of two identical light L chains and two identical heavy H chains an IgM antibody consists of 5 of the basic heterotetramer unit along with an additional polypeptide called J chain and therefore contain 10 antigen binding sites while secreted IgA antibodies can polymerize to form polyvalent assemblages comprising 2 5 of the basic 4 chain units along with J chain . In the case of IgGs the 4 chain unit is generally about 150 000 daltons. Each L chain is linked to a H chain by one covalent disulfide bond while the two H chains are linked to each other by one or more disulfide bonds depending on the H chain isotype. Each H and L chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each H chain has at the N terminus a variable domain V followed by three constant domains C for each of the and chains and four Cdomains for and isotypes. Each L chain has at the N terminus a variable domain V followed by a constant domain C at its other end. The Vis aligned with the Vand the Cis aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain C1 . Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light chain and heavy chain variable domains. The pairing of a Vand Vtogether forms a single antigen binding site. For the structure and properties of the different classes of antibodies see e.g. 8th edition Daniel P. Stites Abba I. Terr and Tristram G. Parslow eds. Appleton Lange Norwalk Conn. 1994 page 71 and Chapter 6.

The L chain from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types called kappa and lambda based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains. Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains C immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes or isotypes. There are five classes of immunoglobulins IgA IgD IgE IgG and IgM having heavy chains designated and respectively. The and classes are further divided into subclasses on the basis of relatively minor differences in Csequence and function e.g. humans express the following subclasses IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 IgG4 IgA1 and IgA2.

The term variable refers to the fact that certain segments of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies. The V domain mediates antigen binding and define specificity of a particular antibody for its particular antigen. However the variability is not evenly distributed across the 110 amino acid span of the variable domains. Instead the V regions consist of relatively invariant stretches called framework regions FRs of 15 30 amino acids separated by shorter regions of extreme variability called hypervariable regions that are each 9 12 amino acids long. The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FRs largely adopting a sheet configuration connected by three hypervariable regions which form loops connecting and in some cases forming part of the sheet structure. The hypervariable regions in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FRs and with the hypervariable regions from the other chain contribute to the formation of the antigen binding site of antibodies see Kabat et al. 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 . The constant domains are not involved directly in binding an antibody to an antigen but exhibit various effector functions such as participation of the antibody in antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ADCC .

The term hypervariable region when used herein refers to the amino acid residues of an antibody which are responsible for antigen binding. The hypervariable region generally comprises amino acid residues from a complementarity determining region or CDR e.g. around about residues 24 34 L1 50 56 L2 and 89 97 L3 in the V and around about 1 35 H1 50 65 H2 and 95 102 H3 in the V Kabat et al. 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 and or those residues from a hypervariable loop e.g. residues 26 32 L1 50 52 L2 and 91 96 L3 in the V and 26 32 H1 53 55 H2 and 96 101 H3 in the V Chothia and Lesk 196 901 917 1987 .

The term monoclonal antibody as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies i.e. the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore in contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which include different antibodies directed against different determinants epitopes each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity the monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they may be synthesized uncontaminated by other antibodies. The modifier monoclonal is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example the monoclonal antibodies useful in the present invention may be prepared by the hybridoma methodology first described by Kohler et al. 256 495 1975 or may be made using recombinant DNA methods in bacterial eukaryotic animal or plant cells see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 . The monoclonal antibodies may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al. 352 624 628 1991 and Marks et al. 222 581 597 1991 for example.

The monoclonal antibodies herein include chimeric antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass while the remainder of the chain s is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass as well as fragments of such antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity see U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 and Morrison et al. 81 6851 6855 1984 . Chimeric antibodies of interest herein include primatized antibodies comprising variable domain antigen binding sequences derived from a non human primate e.g. Old World Monkey Ape etc and human constant region sequences.

An intact antibody is one which comprises an antigen binding site as well as a Cand at least heavy chain constant domains C1 C2 and C3. The constant domains may be native sequence constant domains e.g. human native sequence constant domains or amino acid sequence variant thereof. Preferably the intact antibody has one or more effector functions.

 Antibody fragments comprise a portion of an intact antibody preferably the antigen binding or variable region of the intact antibody. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab Fab F ab and Fv fragments diabodies linear antibodies see U.S. Pat. No. 5 641 870 Example 2 Zapata et al. 8 10 1057 1062 1995 single chain antibody molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.

Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen binding fragments called Fab fragments and a residual Fc fragment a designation reflecting the ability to crystallize readily. The Fab fragment consists of an entire L chain along with the variable region domain of the H chain V and the first constant domain of one heavy chain C1 . Each Fab fragment is monovalent with respect to antigen binding i.e. it has a single antigen binding site. Pepsin treatment of an antibody yields a single large F ab fragment which roughly corresponds to two disulfide linked Fab fragments having divalent antigen binding activity and is still capable of cross linking antigen. Fab fragments differ from Fab fragments by having additional few residues at the carboxy terminus of the C1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab SH is the designation herein for Fab in which the cysteine residue s of the constant domains bear a free thiol group. F ab antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.

The Fc fragment comprises the carboxy terminal portions of both H chains held together by disulfides. The effector functions of antibodies are determined by sequences in the Fc region which region is also the part recognized by Fc receptors FcR found on certain types of cells.

 Fv is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen recognition and binding site. This fragment consists of a dimer of one heavy and one light chain variable region domain in tight non covalent association. From the folding of these two domains emanate six hypervariable loops 3 loops each from the H and L chain that contribute the amino acid residues for antigen binding and confer antigen binding specificity to the antibody. However even a single variable domain or half of an Fv comprising only three CDRs specific for an antigen has the ability to recognize and bind antigen although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.

 Single chain Fv also abbreviated as sFv or scFv are antibody fragments that comprise the Vand Vantibody domains connected into a single polypeptide chain. Preferably the sFv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the Vand Vdomains which enables the sFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of sFv see Pluckthun in vol. 113 Rosenburg and Moore eds. Springer Verlag New York pp. 269 315 1994 Borrebaeck 1995 infra.

The term diabodies refers to small antibody fragments prepared by constructing sFv fragments see preceding paragraph with short linkers about 5 10 residues between the Vand Vdomains such that inter chain but not intra chain pairing of the V domains is achieved resulting in a bivalent fragment i.e. fragment having two antigen binding sites. Bispecific diabodies are heterodimers of two crossover sFv fragments in which the Vand Vdomains of the two antibodies are present on different polypeptide chains. Diabodies are described more fully in for example EP 404 097 WO 93 11161 and Hollinger et al. 90 6444 6448 1993 .

 Humanized forms of non human e.g. rodent antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from the non human antibody. For the most part humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins recipient antibody in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non human species donor antibody such as mouse rat rabbit or non human primate having the desired antibody specificity affinity and capability. In some instances framework region FR residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non human residues. Furthermore humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one and typically two variable domains in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region Fc typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details see Jones et al. 321 522 525 1986 Riechmann et al. 332 323 329 1988 and Presta 2 593 596 1992 .

A species dependent antibody e.g. a mammalian anti human IgE antibody is an antibody which has a stronger binding affinity for an antigen from a first mammalian species than it has for a homologue of that antigen from a second mammalian species. Normally the species dependent antibody bind specifically to a human antigen i.e. has a binding affinity Kd value of no more than about 1 10M preferably no more than about 1 10and most preferably no more than about 1 10M but has a binding affinity for a homologue of the antigen from a second non human mammalian species which is at least about 50 fold or at least about 500 fold or at least about 1000 fold weaker than its binding affinity for the human antigen. The species dependent antibody can be of any of the various types of antibodies as defined above but preferably is a humanized or human antibody.

A PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 binding oligopeptide is an oligopeptide that binds preferably specifically to a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide as described herein.

PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 binding oligopeptides usually are or are at least about 5 amino acids in length alternatively are or are at least about 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 or 100 amino acids in length or more wherein such oligopeptides that are capable of binding preferably specifically to a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide as described herein.

A PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 binding organic molecule is an organic molecule other than an oligopeptide or antibody as defined herein that binds preferably specifically to a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide as described herein. PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 binding organic molecules may be identified and chemically synthesized using known methodology see e.g. PCT Publication Nos. WO00 00823 and WO00 39585 . PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 binding organic molecules are usually less than about 2000 daltons in size alternatively less than about 1500 750 500 250 or 200 daltons in size wherein such organic molecules that are capable of binding preferably specifically to a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide as described herein may be identified without undue experimentation using well known techniques. In this regard it is noted that techniques for screening organic molecule libraries for molecules that are capable of binding to a polypeptide target are well known in the art see e.g. PCT Publication Nos. WO00 00823 and WO00 39585 .

An antibody oligopeptide or other organic molecule which binds an antigen of interest e.g. a tumor associated polypeptide antigen target is one that binds the antigen with sufficient affinity such that the antibody oligopeptide or other organic molecule is preferably useful as a diagnostic and or therapeutic agent in targeting a cell or tissue expressing the antigen and does not significantly cross react with other proteins. The extent of binding of the antibody oligopeptide or other organic molecule to a non target protein will be less than about 10 of the binding of the antibody oligopeptide or other organic molecule to its particular target protein as determined by fluorescence activated cell sorting FACS analysis or radioimmunoprecipitation RIA . With regard to the binding of an antibody oligopeptide or other organic molecule to a target molecule the term specific binding or specifically binds to or is specific for a particular polypeptide or an epitope on a particular polypeptide target means binding that is measurably different from a non specific interaction. Specific binding can be measured for example by determining binding of a molecule compared to binding of a control molecule which generally is a molecule of similar structure that does not have binding activity. For example specific binding can be determined by competition with a control molecule that is similar to the target for example an excess of non labeled target. In this case specific binding is indicated if the binding of the labeled target to a probe is competitively inhibited by excess unlabeled target. The term specific binding or specifically binds to or is specific for a particular polypeptide or an epitope on a particular polypeptide target as used herein can be exhibited for example by a molecule having a Kd for the target of at least about 10M alternatively at least about 10M alternatively at least about 10M alternatively at least about 10M alternatively at least about 10M alternatively at least about 10M alternatively at least about 10M alternatively at least about 10M alternatively at least about 10M or greater. The term specific binding refers to binding where a molecule binds to a particular polypeptide or epitope on a particular polypeptide without substantially binding to any other polypeptide or polypeptide epitope.

An antibody oligopeptide or other organic molecule that inhibits the growth of tumor cells expressing a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 or a growth inhibitory antibody oligopeptide or other organic molecule is one which results in measurable growth inhibition of cancer cells expressing or overexpressing the appropriate PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide. The PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide may be a transmembrane polypeptide expressed on the surface of a cancer cell or may be a polypeptide that is produced and secreted by a cancer cell. Preferred growth inhibitory anti PRO227 anti PRO233 anti PRO238 anti PRO1328 anti PRO4342 anti PRO7423 anti PRO10096 anti PRO21384 anti PRO353 or anti PRO1885 antibodies oligopeptides or organic molecules inhibit growth of PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 expressing tumor cells by or by greater than 20 preferably from about 20 to about 50 and even more preferably by or by greater than 50 e.g. from about 50 to about 100 as compared to the appropriate control the control typically being tumor cells not treated with the antibody oligopeptide or other organic molecule being tested. Growth inhibition can be measured at an antibody concentration of about 0.1 to 30 g ml or about 0.5 nM to 200 nM in cell culture where the growth inhibition is determined 1 10 days after exposure of the tumor cells to the antibody. Growth inhibition of tumor cells in vivo can be determined in various ways. The antibody is growth inhibitory in vivo if administration of the anti PRO227 anti PRO233 anti PRO238 anti PRO1328 anti PRO4342 anti PRO7423 anti PRO10096 anti PRO21384 anti PRO353 or anti PRO1885 antibody at about 1 g kg to about 100 mg kg body weight results in reduction in tumor size or tumor cell proliferation within about 5 days to 3 months from the first administration of the antibody preferably within about 5 to 30 days.

An antibody oligopeptide or other organic molecule which induces apoptosis is one which induces programmed cell death as determined by binding of annexin V fragmentation of DNA cell shrinkage dilation of endoplasmic reticulum cell fragmentation and or formation of membrane vesicles called apoptotic bodies . The cell is usually one which overexpresses a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide. Preferably the cell is a tumor cell e.g. a prostate breast ovarian stomach endometrial lung kidney colon bladder cell. Various methods are available for evaluating the cellular events associated with apoptosis. For example phosphatidyl serine PS translocation can be measured by annexin binding DNA fragmentation can be evaluated through DNA laddering and nuclear chromatin condensation along with DNA fragmentation can be evaluated by any increase in hypodiploid cells. Preferably the antibody oligopeptide or other organic molecule which induces apoptosis is one which results in or in about 2 to 50 fold preferably in or in about 5 to 50 fold and most preferably in or in about 10 to 50 fold induction of annexin binding relative to untreated cell in an annexin binding assay.

Antibody effector functions refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region of an antibody and vary with the antibody isotype. Examples of antibody effector functions include C1q binding and complement dependent cytotoxicity Fc receptor binding antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ADCC phagocytosis down regulation of cell surface receptors e.g. B cell receptor and B cell activation.

 Antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity or ADCC refers to a form of cytotoxicity in which secreted Ig bound onto Fc receptors FcRs present on certain cytotoxic cells e.g. Natural Killer NK cells neutrophils and macrophages enable these cytotoxic effector cells to bind specifically to an antigen bearing target cell and subsequently kill the target cell with cytotoxins. The antibodies arm the cytotoxic cells and are absolutely required for such killing. The primary cells for mediating ADCC NK cells express Fc RIII only whereas monocytes express Fc RI Fc RII and Fc RIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet 9 457 92 1991 . To assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest an in vitro ADCC assay such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 500 362 or 5 821 337 may be performed. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC and Natural Killer NK cells. Alternatively or additionally ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo e.g. in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. 95 652 656 1998 .

 Fc receptor or FcR describes a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an antibody. The preferred FcR is a native sequence human FcR. Moreover a preferred FcR is one which binds an IgG antibody a gamma receptor and includes receptors of the Fc RI Fc RII and Fc RIII subclasses including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of these receptors. Fc RII receptors include Fc RIIA an activating receptor and Fc RIIB an inhibiting receptor which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof.

It is noted that proteins produced in separate expression rounds may be given different PRO numbers but the UNQ number is unique for any given DNA and the encoded protein and will not be changed. However for sake of simplicity in the present specification the protein encoded by the full length native nucleic acid molecules disclosed herein as well as all further native homologues and variants included in the foregoing definition of PRO will be referred to as PRO number regardless of their origin or mode of preparation.

As disclosed in the Examples below various cDNA clones have been deposited with the ATCC. The actual nucleotide sequences of those clones can readily be determined by the skilled artisan by sequencing of the deposited clone using routine methods in the art. The predicted amino acid sequence can be determined from the nucleotide sequence using routine skill.

B. PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 Polypeptide Variants

In addition to the full length native sequence PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides described herein it is contemplated that PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 variants can be prepared. PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 variants can be prepared by introducing appropriate nucleotide changes into the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 DNA and or by synthesis of the desired PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that amino acid changes may alter post translational processes of the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide such as changing the number or position of glycosylation sites or altering the membrane anchoring characteristics.

Variations in the native full length sequence PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide or in various domains of the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide described herein can be made for example using any of the techniques and guidelines for conservative and non conservative mutations set forth for instance in U.S. Pat. No. 5 364 934. Variations may be a substitution deletion or insertion of one or more codons encoding the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide that results in a change in the amino acid sequence of the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide as compared with the native sequence PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide. Optionally the variation is by substitution of at least one amino acid with any other amino acid in one or more of the domains of the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide. Guidance in determining which amino acid residue may be inserted substituted or deleted without adversely affecting the desired activity may be found by comparing the sequence of the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide with that of homologous known protein molecules and minimizing the number of amino acid sequence changes made in regions of high homology. Amino acid substitutions can be the result of replacing one amino acid with another amino acid having similar structural and or chemical properties such as the replacement of a leucine with a serine i.e. conservative amino acid replacements. Insertions or deletions may optionally be in the range of about 1 to 5 amino acids. The variation allowed may be determined by systematically making insertions deletions or substitutions of amino acids in the sequence and testing the resulting variants for activity exhibited by the full length or mature native sequence.

PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide fragments are provided herein. Such fragments may be truncated at the N terminus or C terminus or may lack internal residues for example when compared with a full length native protein. Certain fragments lack amino acid residues that are not essential for a desired biological activity of the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide.

PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 fragments may be prepared by any of a number of conventional techniques. Desired peptide fragments may be chemically synthesized. An alternative approach involves generating PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 fragments by enzymatic digestion e.g. by treating the protein with an enzyme known to cleave proteins at sites defined by particular amino acid residues or by digesting the DNA with suitable restriction enzymes and isolating the desired fragment. Yet another suitable technique involves isolating and amplifying a DNA fragment encoding a desired polypeptide fragment by polymerase chain reaction PCR . Oligonucleotides that define the desired termini of the DNA fragment are employed at the 5 and 3 primers in the PCR. Preferably PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide fragments share at least one biological and or immunological activity with the native PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide disclosed herein.

Conservative substitutions of interest are shown in Table 6 under the heading of preferred substitutions. If such substitutions result in a change in biological activity then more substantial changes denominated exemplary substitutions in Table 6 or as further described below in reference to amino acid classes are preferably introduced and the products screened.

Substantial modifications in function or immunological identity of the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide are accomplished by selecting substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining a the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution for example as a sheet or helical conformation b the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site or c the bulk of the side chain. Naturally occurring residues are divided into groups based on common side chain properties 

Amino acids may be grouped according to similarities in the properties of their side chains in A. L. Lehninger in Biochemistry second ed. pp. 73 75 Worth Publishers New York 1975 

Alternatively naturally occurring residues may be divided into groups based on common side chain properties 

Non conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class. Such substituted residues also may be introduced into the conservative substitution sites or more preferably into the remaining non conserved sites.

The variations can be made using methods known in the art such as oligonucleotide mediated site directed mutagenesis alanine scanning and PCR mutagenesis. Site directed mutagenesis Carter et al. 13 4331 1986 Zoller et al. 10 6487 1987 cassette mutagenesis Wells et al. 34 315 1985 restriction selection mutagenesis Wells et al. 317 415 1986 or other known techniques can be performed on the cloned DNA to produce the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 variant DNA.

Scanning amino acid analysis can also be employed to identify one or more amino acids along a contiguous sequence. Among the preferred scanning amino acids are relatively small neutral amino acids. Such amino acids include alanine glycine serine and cysteine. Alanine is typically a preferred scanning amino acid among this group because it eliminates the side chain beyond the beta carbon and is less likely to alter the main chain conformation of the variant Cunningham and Wells 244 1081 1085 1989 . Alanine is also typically preferred because it is the most common amino acid. Further it is frequently found in both buried and exposed positions Creighton W.H. Freeman Co. N.Y. Chothia 150 1 1976 . If alanine substitution does not yield adequate amounts of variant an isoteric amino acid can be used.

Covalent modifications of PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides are included within the scope of this invention. One type of covalent modification includes reacting targeted amino acid residues of a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide with an organic derivatizing agent that is capable of reacting with selected side chains or the N or C terminal residues of the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide. Derivatization with bifunctional agents is useful for instance for crosslinking PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides to a water insoluble support matrix or surface for use in the method for purifying anti PRO227 anti PRO233 anti PRO238 anti PRO1328 anti PRO4342 anti PRO7423 anti PRO10096 anti PRO21384 anti PRO353 or anti PRO1885 antibodies and vice versa. Commonly used crosslinking agents include e.g. 1 1 bis diazoacetyl 2 phenylethane glutaraldehyde N hydroxysuccinimide esters for example esters with 4 azidosalicylic acid homobifunctional imidoesters including disuccinimidyl esters such as 3 3 dithiobis succinimidylpropionate bifunctionalmaleimides such as bis N maleimido 1 8 octane and agents such as ethyl 3 p azidophenyl dithio propioimidate.

Other modifications include deamidation of glutaminyl and asparaginyl residues to the corresponding glutamyl and aspartyl residues respectively hydroxylation of proline and lysine phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups of seryl or threonyl residues methylation of the amino groups of lysine arginine and histidine side chains T.E. Creighton W.H. Freeman Co. San Francisco pp. 79 86 1983 acetylation of the N terminal amine and amidation of any C terminal carboxyl group.

Another type of covalent modification of the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide included within the scope of this invention comprises altering the native glycosylation pattern of the polypeptide. Altering the native glycosylation pattern is intended for purposes herein to mean deleting one or more carbohydrate moieties found in native sequence PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides either by removing the underlying glycosylation site or by deleting the glycosylation by chemical and or enzymatic means and or adding one or more glycosylation sites that are not present in the native sequence PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide. In addition the phrase includes qualitative changes in the glycosylation of the native proteins involving a change in the nature and proportions of the various carbohydrate moieties present.

Addition of glycosylation sites to the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide may be accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence. The alteration may be made for example by the addition of or substitution by one or more serine or threonine residues to the native sequence PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 for O linked glycosylation sites . The PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 amino acid sequence may optionally be altered through changes at the DNA level particularly by mutating the DNA encoding the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide at preselected bases such that codons are generated that will translate into the desired amino acids.

Another means of increasing the number of carbohydrate moieties on the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide is by chemical or enzymatic coupling of glycosides to the polypeptide. Such methods are described in the art e.g. in WO 87 05330 published 11 Sep. 1987 and in Aplin and Wriston . pp. 259 306 1981 .

Removal of carbohydrate moieties present on the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide may be accomplished chemically or enzymatically or by mutational substitution of codons encoding for amino acid residues that serve as targets for glycosylation. Chemical deglycosylation techniques are known in the art and described for instance by Hakimuddin et al. 259 52 1987 and by Edge et al. 118 131 1981 . Enzymatic cleavage of carbohydrate moieties on polypeptides can be achieved by the use of a variety of endo and exo glycosidases as described by Thotakura et al. 138 350 1987 .

Another type of covalent modification of PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides comprises linking the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide to one of a variety of nonproteinaceous polymers e.g. polyethylene glycol PEG polypropylene glycol or polyoxyalkylenes in the manner set forth in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 640 835 4 496 689 4 301 144 4 670 417 4 791 192 or 4 179 337.

The PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides of the present invention may also be modified in a way to form a chimeric molecule comprising the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide fused to another heterologous polypeptide or amino acid sequence.

Such a chimeric molecule comprises a fusion of the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide with a tag polypeptide which provides an epitope to which an anti tag antibody can selectively bind. The epitope tag is generally placed at the amino or carboxyl terminus of the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide. The presence of such epitope tagged forms of the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide can be detected using an antibody against the tag polypeptide. Also provision of the epitope tag enables the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide to be readily purified by affinity purification using an anti tag antibody or another type of affinity matrix that binds to the epitope tag. Various tag polypeptides and their respective antibodies are well known in the art. Examples include poly histidine poly his or poly histidine glycine poly his gly tags the flu HA tag polypeptide and its antibody 12CA5 Field et al. 8 2159 2165 1988 the c myc tag and the 8F9 3C7 6E10 G4 B7 and 9E10 antibodies thereto Evan et al. 5 3610 3616 1985 and the Herpes Simplex virus glycoprotein D gD tag and its antibody Paborsky et al. 3 6 547 553 1990 . Other tag polypeptides include the Flag peptide Hopp et al. 6 1204 1210 1988 the KT3 epitope peptide Martin et al. 255 192 194 1992 an tubulin epitope peptide Skinner et al. 266 15163 15166 1991 and the T7 gene 10 protein peptide tag Lutz Freyermuth et al. 87 6393 6397 1990 .

The chimeric molecule may comprise a fusion of the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide with an immunoglobulin or a particular region of an immunoglobulin. For a bivalent form of the chimeric molecule also referred to as an immunoadhesin such a fusion could be to the Fc region of an IgG molecule. The Ig fusions preferably include the substitution of a soluble transmembrane domain deleted or inactivated form of a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide in place of at least one variable region within an Ig molecule. In a particularly preferred aspect of the invention the immunoglobulin fusion includes the hinge CH2 and CH3 or the hinge CH1 CH2 and CH3 regions of an IgG1 molecule. For the production of immunoglobulin fusions see also U.S. Pat. No. 5 428 130 issued Jun. 27 1995.

D. Preparation of PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 Polypeptides

The description below relates primarily to production of PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides by culturing cells transformed or transfected with a vector containing PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 nucleic acid. It is of course contemplated that alternative methods which are well known in the art may be employed to prepare PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides. For instance the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 sequence or portions thereof may be produced by direct peptide synthesis using solid phase techniques see e.g. Stewart et al. W.H. Freeman Co. San Francisco Calif. 1969 Merrifield 85 2149 2154 1963 . In vitro protein synthesis may be performed using manual techniques or by automation. Automated synthesis may be accomplished for instance using an Applied Biosystems Peptide Synthesizer Foster City Calif. using manufacturer s instructions. Various portions of the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide may be chemically synthesized separately and combined using chemical or enzymatic methods to produce the full length PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide.

1. Isolation of DNA Encoding PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 Polypeptides

DNA encoding PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides may be obtained from a cDNA library prepared from tissue believed to possess the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 mRNA and to express it at a detectable level. Accordingly human PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 DNA can be conveniently obtained from a cDNA library prepared from human tissue such as described in the Examples. The PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 encoding gene may also be obtained from a genomic library or by known synthetic procedures e.g. automated nucleic acid synthesis .

Libraries can be screened with probes such as antibodies to the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide or oligonucleotides of at least about 20 80 bases designed to identify the gene of interest or the protein encoded by it. Screening the cDNA or genomic library with the selected probe may be conducted using standard procedures such as described in Sambrook et al. New York Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 1989 . An alternative means to isolate the gene encoding PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 is to use PCR methodology Sambrook et al. supra Dieffenbach et al. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 1995 .

The Examples below describe techniques for screening a cDNA library. The oligonucleotide sequences selected as probes should be of sufficient length and sufficiently unambiguous that false positives are minimized. The oligonucleotide is preferably labeled such that it can be detected upon hybridization to DNA in the library being screened. Methods of labeling are well known in the art and include the use of radiolabels like P labeled ATP biotinylation or enzyme labeling. Hybridization conditions including moderate stringency and high stringency are provided in Sambrook et al. supra.

Sequences identified in such library screening methods can be compared and aligned to other known sequences deposited and available in public databases such as GenBank or other private sequence databases. Sequence identity at either the amino acid or nucleotide level within defined regions of the molecule or across the full length sequence can be determined using methods known in the art and as described herein.

Nucleic acid having protein coding sequence may be obtained by screening selected cDNA or genomic libraries using the deduced amino acid sequence disclosed herein for the first time and if necessary using conventional primer extension procedures as described in Sambrook et al. supra to detect precursors and processing intermediates of mRNA that may not have been reverse transcribed into cDNA.

Host cells are transfected or transformed with expression or cloning vectors described herein for PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide production and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters selecting transformants or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences. The culture conditions such as media temperature pH and the like can be selected by the skilled artisan without undue experimentation. In general principles protocols and practical techniques for maximizing the productivity of cell cultures can be found in M. Butler ed. IRL Press 1991 and Sambrook et al. supra.

Methods of eukaryotic cell transfection and prokaryotic cell transformation are known to the ordinarily skilled artisan for example CaCl CaPO liposome mediated and electroporation. Depending on the host cell used transformation is performed using standard techniques appropriate to such cells. The calcium treatment employing calcium chloride as described in Sambrook et al. supra or electroporation is generally used for prokaryotes. Infection with is used for transformation of certain plant cells as described by Shaw et al. 23 315 1983 and WO 89 05859 published 29 Jun. 1989. For mammalian cells without such cell walls the calcium phosphate precipitation method of Graham and van der Eb 52 456 457 1978 can be employed. General aspects of mammalian cell host system transfections have been described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 399 216. Transformations into yeast are typically carried out according to the method of Van Solingen et al. 130 946 1977 and Hsiao et al. . 76 3829 1979 . However other methods for introducing DNA into cells such as by nuclear microinjection electroporation bacterial protoplast fusion with intact cells or polycations e.g. polybrene polyornithine may also be used. For various techniques for transforming mammalian cells see Keown et al. 185 527 537 1990 and Mansour et al. 336 348 352 1988 .

Suitable host cells for cloning or expressing the DNA in the vectors herein include prokaryote yeast or higher eukaryote cells. Suitable prokaryotes include but are not limited to eubacteria such as Gram negative or Gram positive organisms for example Enterobacteriaceae such as . Various strains are publicly available such as K12 strain MM294 ATCC 31 446 X1776 ATCC 31 537 strain W3110 ATCC 27 325 and K5 772 ATCC 53 635 . Other suitable prokaryotic host cells include Enterobacteriaceae such as e.g. e.g. e.g. and as well as such as and e.g. 41P disclosed in DD 266 710 published 12 Apr. 1989 such as and . These examples are illustrative rather than limiting. Strain W3110 is one particularly preferred host or parent host because it is a common host strain for recombinant DNA product fermentations. Preferably the host cell secretes minimal amounts of proteolytic enzymes. For example strain W3110 may be modified to effect a genetic mutation in the genes encoding proteins endogenous to the host with examples of such hosts including W3110 strain 1A2 which has the complete genotype tonA W3110 strain 9E4 which has the complete genotype tonA ptr3 W3110 strain 27C7 ATCC 55 244 which has the complete genotype tonA ptr3 phoA E15 argF lac 169 degP ompT kanW3110 strain 37D6 which has the complete genotype tonA ptr3 phoA E15 argF lac 169 degP ompT rbs7 ilvG kanW3110 strain 40B4 which is strain 37D6 with a non kanamycin resistant degP deletion mutation and an strain having mutant periplasmic protease disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4 946 783 issued 7 Aug. 1990. Alternatively in vitro methods of cloning e.g. PCR or other nucleic acid polymerase reactions are suitable.

In addition to prokaryotes eukaryotic microbes such as filamentous fungi or yeast are suitable cloning or expression hosts for PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 encoding vectors. is a commonly used lower eukaryotic host microorganism. Others include Beach and Nurse 290 140 1981 EP 139 383 published 2 May 1985 hosts U.S. Pat. No. 4 943 529 Fleer et al. 9 968 975 1991 such as e.g. MW98 8C CBS683 CBS4574 Louvencourt et al. 154 2 737 742 1983 ATCC 12 424 ATCC 16 045 ATCC 24 178 ATCC 56 500 ATCC 36 906 Van den Berg et al. 8 135 1990 and EP 402 226 EP 183 070 Sreekrishna et al. 28 265 278 1988 EP 244 234 Case et al. 76 5259 5263 1979 such as EP 394 538 published 31 Oct. 1990 and filamentous fungi such as e.g. WO 91 00357 published 10 Jan. 1991 and hosts such as Ballance et al. 112 284 289 1983 Tilburn et al. 26 205 221 1983 Yelton et al. 81 1470 1474 1984 and Kelly and Hynes 4 475 479 1985 . Methylotropic yeasts are suitable herein and include but are not limited to yeast capable of growth on methanol selected from the genera consisting of and . A list of specific species that are exemplary of this class of yeasts may be found in C. Anthony 269 1982 .

Suitable host cells for the expression of glycosylated PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides are derived from multicellular organisms. Examples of invertebrate cells include insect cells such as S2 and Sf9 as well as plant cells. Examples of useful mammalian host cell lines include Chinese hamster ovary CHO and COS cells. More specific examples include monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 COS 7 ATCC CRL 1651 human embryonic kidney line 293 or 293 cells subcloned for growth in suspension culture Graham et al. 36 59 1977 Chinese hamster ovary cells DHFR CHO Urlaub and Chasin 77 4216 1980 mouse sertoli cells TM4 Mather 23 243 251 1980 human lung cells W138 ATCC CCL 75 human liver cells Hep G2 HB 8065 and mouse mammary tumor MMT 060562 ATCC CCL51 . The selection of the appropriate host cell is deemed to be within the skill in the art.

The nucleic acid e.g. cDNA or genomic DNA encoding PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides may be inserted into a replicable vector for cloning amplification of the DNA or for expression. Various vectors are publicly available. The vector may for example be in the form of a plasmid cosmid viral particle or phage. The appropriate nucleic acid sequence may be inserted into the vector by a variety of procedures. In general DNA is inserted into an appropriate restriction endonuclease site s using techniques known in the art. Vector components generally include but are not limited to one or more of a signal sequence an origin of replication one or more marker genes an enhancer element a promoter and a transcription termination sequence. Construction of suitable vectors containing one or more of these components employs standard ligation techniques which are known to the skilled artisan.

The PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide may be produced recombinantly not only directly but also as a fusion polypeptide with a heterologous polypeptide which may be a signal sequence or other polypeptide having a specific cleavage site at the N terminus of the mature protein or polypeptide. In general the signal sequence may be a component of the vector or it may be a part of the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 encoding DNA that is inserted into the vector. The signal sequence may be a prokaryotic signal sequence selected for example from the group of the alkaline phosphatase penicillinase 1 pp or heat stable enterotoxin II leaders. For yeast secretion the signal sequence may be e.g. the yeast invertase leader alpha factor leader including and factor leaders the latter described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 010 182 or acid phosphatase leader the glucoamylase leader EP 362 179 published 4 Apr. 1990 or the signal described in WO 90 13646 published 15 Nov. 1990. In mammalian cell expression mammalian signal sequences may be used to direct secretion of the protein such as signal sequences from secreted polypeptides of the same or related species as well as viral secretory leaders.

Both expression and cloning vectors contain a nucleic acid sequence that enables the vector to replicate in one or more selected host cells. Such sequences are well known for a variety of bacteria yeast and viruses. The origin of replication from the plasmid pBR322 is suitable for most Gram negative bacteria the 2 plasmid origin is suitable for yeast and various viral origins SV40 polyoma adenovirus VSV or BPV are useful for cloning vectors in mammalian cells.

Expression and cloning vectors will typically contain a selection gene also termed a selectable marker. Typical selection genes encode proteins that a confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins e.g. ampicillin neomycin methotrexate or tetracycline b complement auxotrophic deficiencies or c supply critical nutrients not available from complex media e.g. the gene encoding D alanine racemase for

An example of suitable selectable markers for mammalian cells are those that enable the identification of cells competent to take up the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 encoding nucleic acid such as DHFR or thymidine kinase. An appropriate host cell when wild type DHFR is employed is the CHO cell line deficient in DHFR activity prepared and propagated as described by Urlaub et al. 77 4216 1980 . A suitable selection gene for use in yeast is the trp1 gene present in the yeast plasmid YRp7 Stinchcomb et al. 282 39 1979 Kingsman et al. 7 141 1979 Tschemper et al. 10 157 1980 . The trp1 gene provides a selection marker for a mutant strain of yeast lacking the ability to grow in tryptophan for example ATCC No. 44076 or PEP4 1 Jones 85 12 1977 .

Expression and cloning vectors usually contain a promoter operably linked to the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 encoding nucleic acid sequence to direct mRNA synthesis. Promoters recognized by a variety of potential host cells are well known. Promoters suitable for use with prokaryotic hosts include the lactamase and lactose promoter systems Chang et al. 275 615 1978 Goeddel et al. 281 544 1979 alkaline phosphatase a tryptophan tip promoter system Goeddel 8 4057 1980 EP 36 776 and hybrid promoters such as the tac promoter deBoer et al. 80 21 25 1983 . Promoters for use in bacterial systems also will contain a Shine Dalgarno S.D. sequence operably linked to the DNA encoding PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides.

Examples of suitable promoting sequences for use with yeast hosts include the promoters for 3 phosphoglycerate kinase Hitzeman et al. 255 2073 1980 or other glycolytic enzymes Hess et al. 7 149 1968 Holland 17 4900 1978 such as enolase glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase hexokinase pyruvate decarboxylase phosphofructokinase glucose 6 phosphate isomerase 3 phosphoglycerate mutase pyruvate kinase triosephosphate isomerase phosphoglucose isomerase and glucokinase.

Other yeast promoters which are inducible promoters having the additional advantage of transcription controlled by growth conditions are the promoter regions for alcohol dehydrogenase 2 isocytochrome C acid phosphatase degradative enzymes associated with nitrogen metabolism metallothionein glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase and enzymes responsible for maltose and galactose utilization. Suitable vectors and promoters for use in yeast expression are further described in EP 73 657.

PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 transcription from vectors in mammalian host cells is controlled for example by promoters obtained from the genomes of viruses such as polyoma virus fowlpox virus UK 2 211 504 published 5 Jul. 1989 adenovirus such as Adenovirus 2 bovine papilloma virus avian sarcoma virus cytomegalovirus a retrovirus hepatitis B virus and Simian Virus 40 SV40 from heterologous mammalian promoters e.g. the actin promoter or an immunoglobulin promoter and from heat shock promoters provided such promoters are compatible with the host cell systems.

Transcription of a DNA encoding the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide by higher eukaryotes may be increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector. Enhancers are cis acting elements of DNA usually about from 10 to 300 bp that act on a promoter to increase its transcription. Many enhancer sequences are now known from mammalian genes globin elastase albumin fetoprotein and insulin . Typically however one will use an enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus. Examples include the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin bp 100 270 the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin and adenovirus enhancers. The enhancer may be spliced into the vector at a position 5 or 3 to the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 coding sequence but is preferably located at a site 5 from the promoter.

Expression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells yeast fungi insect plant animal human or nucleated cells from other multicellular organisms will also contain sequences necessary for the termination of transcription and for stabilizing the mRNA. Such sequences are commonly available from the 5 and occasionally 3 untranslated regions of eukaryotic or viral DNAs or cDNAs. These regions contain nucleotide segments transcribed as polyadenylated fragments in the untranslated portion of the mRNA encoding PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides.

Still other methods vectors and host cells suitable for adaptation to the synthesis of PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides in recombinant vertebrate cell culture are described in Gething et al. 293 620 625 1981 Mantei et al. 281 40 46 1979 EP 117 060 and EP 117 058.

Gene amplification and or expression may be measured in a sample directly for example by conventional Southern blotting Northern blotting to quantitate the transcription of mRNA Thomas 77 5201 5205 1980 dot blotting DNA analysis or in situ hybridization using an appropriately labeled probe based on the sequences provided herein. Alternatively antibodies may be employed that can recognize specific duplexes including DNA duplexes RNA duplexes and DNA RNA hybrid duplexes or DNA protein duplexes. The antibodies in turn may be labeled and the assay may be carried out where the duplex is bound to a surface so that upon the formation of duplex on the surface the presence of antibody bound to the duplex can be detected.

Gene expression alternatively may be measured by immunological methods such as immunohistochemical staining of cells or tissue sections and assay of cell culture or body fluids to quantitate directly the expression of gene product. Antibodies useful for immunohistochemical staining and or assay of sample fluids may be either monoclonal or polyclonal and may be prepared in any mammal. Conveniently the antibodies may be prepared against a native sequence PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide or against a synthetic peptide based on the DNA sequences provided herein or against exogenous sequence fused to PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 DNA and encoding a specific antibody epitope.

Forms of PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides may be recovered from culture medium or from host cell lysates. If membrane bound it can be released from the membrane using a suitable detergent solution e.g. Triton X 100 or by enzymatic cleavage. Cells employed in expression of PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides can be disrupted by various physical or chemical means such as freeze thaw cycling sonication mechanical disruption or cell lysing agents.

It may be desired to purify PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides from recombinant cell proteins or polypeptides. The following procedures are exemplary of suitable purification procedures by fractionation on an ion exchange column ethanol precipitation reverse phase HPLC chromatography on silica or on a cation exchange resin such as DEAE chromatofocusing SDS PAGE ammonium sulfate precipitation gel filtration using for example Sephadex G 75 protein A Sepharose columns to remove contaminants such as IgG and metal chelating columns to bind epitope tagged forms of the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide. Various methods of protein purification may be employed and such methods are known in the art and described for example in Deutscher 182 1990 Scopes Springer Verlag New York 1982 . The purification step s selected will depend for example on the nature of the production process used and the particular PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide produced.

E. Uses for PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 Polypeptides

Nucleotide sequences or their complement encoding PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides have various applications in the art of molecular biology including uses as hybridization probes in chromosome and gene mapping and in the generation of anti sense RNA and DNA. PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 nucleic acid will also be useful for the preparation of PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides by the recombinant techniques described herein.

The full length native sequence PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 gene or portions thereof may be used as hybridization probes for a cDNA library to isolate the full length PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 cDNA or to isolate still other cDNAs for instance those encoding naturally occurring variants of PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides or PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides from other species which have a desired sequence identity to the native PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 sequence disclosed herein. Optionally the length of the probes will be about 20 to about 50 bases. The hybridization probes may be derived from at least partially novel regions of the full length native nucleotide sequence wherein those regions may be determined without undue experimentation or from genomic sequences including promoters enhancer elements and introns of native sequence PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885. By way of example a screening method will comprise isolating the coding region of the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 gene using the known DNA sequence to synthesize a selected probe of about 40 bases. Hybridization probes may be labeled by a variety of labels including radionucleotides such as P or S or enzymatic labels such as alkaline phosphatase coupled to the probe via avidin biotin coupling systems. Labeled probes having a sequence complementary to that of the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 gene of the present invention can be used to screen libraries of human cDNA genomic DNA or mRNA to determine which members of such libraries the probe hybridizes to. Hybridization techniques are described in further detail in the Examples below.

Any EST sequences disclosed in the present application may similarly be employed as probes using the methods disclosed herein.

Other useful fragments of the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 nucleic acids include antisense or sense oligonucleotides comprising a singe stranded nucleic acid sequence either RNA or DNA capable of binding to target PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 mRNA sense or PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 DNA antisense sequences. Antisense or sense oligonucleotides according to the present invention comprise a fragment of the coding region of PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 DNA. Such a fragment generally comprises at least about 14 nucleotides preferably from about 14 to 30 nucleotides. The ability to derive an antisense or a sense oligonucleotide based upon a cDNA sequence encoding a given protein is described in for example Stein and Cohen 48 2659 1988 and van der Krol et al. 6 958 1988 .

Binding of antisense or sense oligonucleotides to target nucleic acid sequences results in the formation of duplexes that block transcription or translation of the target sequence by one of several means including enhanced degradation of the duplexes premature termination of transcription or translation or by other means. The antisense oligonucleotides thus may be used to block expression of PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885. Antisense or sense oligonucleotides further comprise oligonucleotides having modified sugar phosphodiester backbones or other sugar linkages such as those described in WO 91 06629 and wherein such sugar linkages are resistant to endogenous nucleases. Such oligonucleotides with resistant sugar linkages are stable in vivo i.e. capable of resisting enzymatic degradation but retain sequence specificity to be able to bind to target nucleotide sequences.

Other examples of sense or antisense oligonucleotides include those oligonucleotides which are covalently linked to organic moieties such as those described in WO 90 10048 and other moieties that increases affinity of the oligonucleotide for a target nucleic acid sequence such as poly L lysine . Further still intercalating agents such as ellipticine and alkylating agents or metal complexes may be attached to sense or antisense oligonucleotides to modify binding specificities of the antisense or sense oligonucleotide for the target nucleotide sequence.

Antisense or sense oligonucleotides may be introduced into a cell containing the target nucleic acid sequence by any gene transfer method including for example CaPO mediated DNA transfection electroporation or by using gene transfer vectors such as Epstein Barr virus. In a preferred procedure an antisense or sense oligonucleotide is inserted into a suitable retroviral vector. A cell containing the target nucleic acid sequence is contacted with the recombinant retroviral vector either in vivo or ex vivo. Suitable retroviral vectors include but are not limited to those derived from the murine retrovirus M MuLV N2 a retrovirus derived from M MuLV or the double copy vectors designated DCT5A DCT5B and DCT5C see WO 90 13641 .

Sense or antisense oligonucleotides also may be introduced into a cell containing the target nucleotide sequence by formation of a conjugate with a ligand binding molecule as described in WO 91 04753. Suitable ligand binding molecules include but are not limited to cell surface receptors growth factors other cytokines or other ligands that bind to cell surface receptors. Preferably conjugation of the ligand binding molecule does not substantially interfere with the ability of the ligand binding molecule to bind to its corresponding molecule or receptor or block entry of the sense or antisense oligonucleotide or its conjugated version into the cell.

Alternatively a sense or an antisense oligonucleotide may be introduced into a cell containing the target nucleic acid sequence by formation of an oligonucleotide lipid complex as described in WO 90 10448. The sense or antisense oligonucleotide lipid complex is preferably dissociated within the cell by an endogenous lipase.

Antisense or sense RNA or DNA molecules are generally at least about 5 bases in length about 10 bases in length about 15 bases in length about 20 bases in length about 25 bases in length about 30 bases in length about 35 bases in length about 40 bases in length about 45 bases in length about 50 bases in length about 55 bases in length about 60 bases in length about 65 bases in length about 70 bases in length about 75 bases in length about 80 bases in length about 85 bases in length about 90 bases in length about 95 bases in length about 100 bases in length or more.

The probes may also be employed in PCR techniques to generate a pool of sequences for identification of closely related PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 coding sequences.

Nucleotide sequences encoding a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide can also be used to construct hybridization probes for mapping the gene which encodes that PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide and for the genetic analysis of individuals with genetic disorders. The nucleotide sequences provided herein may be mapped to a chromosome and specific regions of a chromosome using known techniques such as in situ hybridization linkage analysis against known chromosomal markers and hybridization screening with libraries.

When the coding sequences for PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 encode a protein which binds to another protein for example where the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 is a receptor the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide can be used in assays to identify the other proteins or molecules involved in the binding interaction. By such methods inhibitors of the receptor ligand binding interaction can be identified. Proteins involved in such binding interactions can also be used to screen for peptide or small molecule inhibitors or agonists of the binding interaction. Also the receptor PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 can be used to isolate correlative ligand s . Screening assays can be designed to find lead compounds that mimic the biological activity of a native PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide or a receptor for PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides. Such screening assays will include assays amenable to high throughput screening of chemical libraries making them particularly suitable for identifying small molecule drug candidates. Small molecules contemplated include synthetic organic or inorganic compounds. The assays can be performed in a variety of formats including protein protein binding assays biochemical screening assays immunoassays and cell based assays which are well characterized in the art.

Nucleic acids which encode PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides or its modified forms can also be used to generate either transgenic animals or knock out animals which in turn are useful in the development and screening of therapeutically useful reagents. A transgenic animal e.g. a mouse or rat is an animal having cells that contain a transgene which transgene was introduced into the animal or an ancestor of the animal at a prenatal e.g. an embryonic stage. A transgene is a DNA which is integrated into the genome of a cell from which a transgenic animal develops. The invention provides cDNA encoding a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide which can be used to clone genomic DNA encoding a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide in accordance with established techniques and the genomic sequences used to generate transgenic animals that contain cells which express DNA encoding PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides. Any technique known in the art may be used to introduce a target gene transgene into animals to produce the founder lines of transgenic animals. Such techniques include but are not limited to pronuclear microinjection U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 873 191 4 736 866 and 4 870 009 retrovirus mediated gene transfer into germ lines Van der Putten et al. 82 6148 6152 1985 gene targeting in embryonic stem cells Thompson et al. 56 313 321 1989 nonspecific insertional inactivation using a gene trap vector U.S. Pat. No. 6 436 707 electroporation of embryos Lo 3 1803 1814 1983 and sperm mediated gene transfer Lavitrano et al. 57 717 723 1989 etc. Typically particular cells would be targeted for a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 transgene incorporation with tissue specific enhancers. Transgenic animals that include a copy of a transgene encoding a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide introduced into the germ line of the animal at an embryonic stage can be used to examine the effect of increased expression of DNA encoding PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides. Such animals can be used as tester animals for reagents thought to confer protection from for example pathological conditions associated with its overexpression. In accordance with this facet of the invention an animal is treated with the reagent and a reduced incidence of the pathological condition compared to untreated animals bearing the transgene would indicate a potential therapeutic intervention for the pathological condition.

Alternatively non human homologues of PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides can be used to construct a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 knock out animal which has a defective or altered gene encoding PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 proteins as a result of homologous recombination between the endogenous gene encoding PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides and altered genomic DNA encoding PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides introduced into an embryonic stem cell of the animal. Preferably the knock out animal is a mammal. More preferably the mammal is a rodent such as a rat or mouse. For example cDNA encoding PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides can be used to clone genomic DNA encoding PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides in accordance with established techniques. A portion of the genomic DNA encoding the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide can be deleted or replaced with another gene such as a gene encoding a selectable marker which can be used to monitor integration. Typically several kilobases of unaltered flanking DNA both at the 5 and 3 ends are included in the vector see e.g. Thomas and Capecchi 51 503 1987 for a description of homologous recombination vectors . The vector is introduced into an embryonic stem cell line e.g. by electroporation and cells in which the introduced DNA has homologously recombined with the endogenous DNA are selected see e.g. Li et al. 69 915 1992 . The selected cells are then injected into a blastocyst of an animal e.g. a mouse or rat to form aggregation chimeras see e.g. Bradley in E. J. Robertson ed. IRL Oxford 1987 pp. 113 152 . A chimeric embryo can then be implanted into a suitable pseudopregnant female foster animal and the embryo brought to term to create a knock out animal. Progeny harboring the homologously recombined DNA in their germ cells can be identified by standard techniques and used to breed animals in which all cells of the animal contain the homologously recombined DNA. Knockout animals can be characterized for instance for their ability to defend against certain pathological conditions and for their development of pathological conditions due to absence of the gene encoding the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide.

In addition knockout mice can be highly informative in the discovery of gene function and pharmaceutical utility for a drug target as well as in the determination of the potential on target side effects associated with a given target. Gene function and physiology are so well conserved between mice and humans. since they are both mammals and contain similar numbers of genes which are highly conserved between the species. It has recently been well documented for example that 98 of genes on mouse chromosome 16 have a human ortholog Mural et al. 296 1661 71 2002 .

Although gene targeting in embryonic stem ES cells has enabled the construction of mice with null mutations in many genes associated with human disease not all genetic diseases are attributable to null mutations. One can design valuable mouse models of human diseases by establishing a method for gene replacement knock in which will disrupt the mouse locus and introduce a human counterpart with mutation Subsequently one can conduct in vivo drug studies targeting the human protein Kitamoto et. Al. 222 742 47 1996 .

Nucleic acid encoding the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides may also be used in gene therapy. In gene therapy applications genes are introduced into cells in order to achieve in vivo synthesis of a therapeutically effective genetic product for example for replacement of a defective gene. Gene therapy includes both conventional gene therapy where a lasting effect is achieved by a single treatment and the administration of gene therapeutic agents which involves the one time or repeated administration of a therapeutically effective DNA or mRNA. Antisense RNAs and DNAs can be used as therapeutic agents for blocking the expression of certain genes in vivo. It has already been shown that short antisense oligonucleotides can be imported into cells where they act as inhibitors despite their low intracellular concentrations caused by their restricted uptake by the cell membrane. Zamecnik et al. 83 4143 4146 1986 . The oligonucleotides can be modified to enhance their uptake e.g. by substituting their negatively charged phosphodiester groups by uncharged groups.

There are a variety of techniques available for introducing nucleic acids into viable cells. The techniques vary depending upon whether the nucleic acid is transferred into cultured cells in vitro or in vivo in the cells of the intended host. Techniques suitable for the transfer of nucleic acid into mammalian cells in vitro include the use of liposomes electroporation microinjection cell fusion DEAE dextran the calcium phosphate precipitation method etc. The currently preferred in vivo gene transfer techniques include transfection with viral typically retroviral vectors and viral coat protein liposome mediated transfection Dzau et al. 11 205 210 1993 . In some situations it is desirable to provide the nucleic acid source with an agent that targets the target cells such as an antibody specific for a cell surface membrane protein or the target cell a ligand for a receptor on the target cell etc. Where liposomes are employed proteins which bind to a cell surface membrane protein associated with endocytosis may be used for targeting and or to facilitate uptake e.g. capsid proteins or fragments thereof tropic for a particular cell type antibodies for proteins which undergo internalization in cycling proteins that target intracellular localization and enhance intracellular half life. The technique of receptor mediated endocytosis is described for example by Wu et al. 262 4429 4432 1987 and Wagner et al. 87 3410 3414 1990 . For review of gene marking and gene therapy protocols see Anderson et al. 256 808 813 1992 .

The PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides described herein may also be employed as molecular weight markers for protein electrophoresis purposes and the isolated nucleic acid sequences may be used for recombinantly expressing those markers.

The nucleic acid molecules encoding the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides or fragments thereof described herein are useful for chromosome identification. In this regard there exists an ongoing need to identify new chromosome markers since relatively few chromosome marking reagents based upon actual sequence data are presently available. Each PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 nucleic acid molecule of the present invention can be used as a chromosome marker.

The PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides and nucleic acid molecules of the present invention may also be used diagnostically for tissue typing wherein the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides of the present invention may be differentially expressed in one tissue as compared to another preferably in a diseased tissue as compared to a normal tissue of the same tissue type. PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 nucleic acid molecules will find use for generating probes for PCR Northern analysis Southern analysis and Western analysis.

The PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides described herein may also be employed as therapeutic agents. The PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides of the present invention can be formulated according to known methods to prepare pharmaceutically useful compositions whereby the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 product hereof is combined in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier vehicle. Therapeutic formulations are prepared for storage by mixing the active ingredient having the desired degree of purity with optional physiologically acceptable carriers excipients or stabilizers 16th edition Osol A. Ed. 1980 in the form of lyophilized formulations or aqueous solutions. Acceptable carriers excipients or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed and include buffers such as phosphate citrate and other organic acids antioxidants including ascorbic acid low molecular weight less than about 10 residues polypeptides proteins such as serum albumin gelatin or immunoglobulins hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone amino acids such as glycine glutamine asparagine arginine or lysine monosaccharides disaccharides and other carbohydrates including glucose mannose or dextrins chelating agents such as EDTA sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol salt forming counterions such as sodium and or nonionic surfactants such as TWEEN PLURONICS or PEG.

The formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes prior to or following lyophilization and reconstitution.

Therapeutic compositions herein generally are placed into a container having a sterile access port for example an intravenous solution bag or vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle.

The route of administration is in accord with known methods e.g. injection or infusion by intravenous intraperitoneal intracerebral intramuscular intraocular intraarterial or intralesional routes topical administration or by sustained release systems.

Dosages and desired drug concentrations of pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may vary depending on the particular use envisioned. The determination of the appropriate dosage or route of administration is well within the skill of an ordinary physician. Animal experiments provide reliable guidance for the determination of effective doses for human therapy. Interspecies scaling of effective doses can be performed following the principles laid down by Mordenti J. and Chappell W. The use of interspecies scaling in toxicokinetics In Toxicokinetics and New Drug Development Yacobi et al. Eds. Pergamon Press New York 1989 pp. 42 96.

When in vivo administration of a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide or agonist or antagonist thereof is employed normal dosage amounts may vary from about 10 ng kg to up to 100 mg kg of mammal body weight or more per day preferably about 1 g kg day to 10 mg kg day depending upon the route of administration. Guidance as to particular dosages and methods of delivery is provided in the literature see for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 657 760 5 206 344 or 5 225 212. It is anticipated that different formulations will be effective for different treatment compounds and different disorders that administration targeting one organ or tissue for example may necessitate delivery in a manner different from that to another organ or tissue.

Where sustained release administration of a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide is desired in a formulation with release characteristics suitable for the treatment of any disease or disorder requiring administration of the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide microencapsulation of the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide is contemplated. Microencapsulation of recombinant proteins for sustained release has been successfully performed with human growth hormone rhGH interferon rhIFN interleukin 2 and MN rgp120.

The sustained release formulations of these proteins were developed using poly lactic coglycolic acid PLGA polymer due to its biocompatibility and wide range of biodegradable properties. The degradation products of PLGA lactic and glycolic acids can be cleared quickly within the human body. Moreover the degradability of this polymer can be adjusted from months to years depending on its molecular weight and composition.

This invention encompasses methods of screening compounds to identify those that mimic the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide agonists or prevent the effect of the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide antagonists . Agonists that mimic a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide would be especially valuable therapeutically in those instances where a negative phenotype is observed based on findings with the non human transgenic animal whose genome comprises a disruption of the gene which encodes for the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide. Antagonists that prevent the effects of a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide would be especially valuable therapeutically in those instances where a positive phenotype is observed based upon observations with the non human transgenic knockout animal. Screening assays for antagonist drug candidates are designed to identify compounds that bind or complex with the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide encoded by the genes identified herein or otherwise interfere with the interaction of the encoded polypeptide with other cellular proteins. Such screening assays will include assays amenable to high throughput screening of chemical libraries making them particularly suitable for identifying small molecule drug candidates.

The assays can be performed in a variety of formats including protein protein binding assays biochemical screening assays immunoassays and cell based assays which are well characterized in the art.

All assays for antagonists are common in that they call for contacting the drug candidate with a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide encoded by a nucleic acid identified herein under conditions and for a time sufficient to allow these two components to interact.

In binding assays the interaction is binding and the complex formed can be isolated or detected in the reaction mixture. The PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide encoded by the gene identified herein or the drug candidate is immobilized on a solid phase e.g. on a microtiter plate by covalent or non covalent attachments. Non covalent attachment generally is accomplished by coating the solid surface with a solution of the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide and drying. Alternatively an immobilized antibody e.g. a monoclonal antibody specific for the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide to be immobilized can be used to anchor it to a solid surface. The assay is performed by adding the non immobilized component which may be labeled by a detectable label to the immobilized component e.g. the coated surface containing the anchored component. When the reaction is complete the non reacted components are removed e.g. by washing and complexes anchored on the solid surface are detected. When the originally non immobilized component carries a detectable label the detection of label immobilized on the surface indicates that complexing occurred. Where the originally non immobilized component does not carry a label complexing can be detected for example by using a labeled antibody specifically binding the immobilized complex.

If the candidate compound interacts with but does not bind to a particular PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide encoded by a gene identified herein its interaction with that polypeptide can be assayed by methods well known for detecting protein protein interactions. Such assays include traditional approaches such as e.g. cross linking co immunoprecipitation and co purification through gradients or chromatographic columns. In addition protein protein interactions can be monitored by using a yeast based genetic system described by Fields and co workers Fields and Song 340 245 246 1989 Chien et al. 88 9578 9582 1991 as disclosed by Chevray and Nathans 89 5789 5793 1991 . Many transcriptional activators such as yeast GAL4 consist of two physically discrete modular domains one acting as the DNA binding domain the other one functioning as the transcription activation domain. The yeast expression system described in the foregoing publications generally referred to as the two hybrid system takes advantage of this property and employs two hybrid proteins one in which the target protein is fused to the DNA binding domain of GAL4 and another in which candidate activating proteins are fused to the activation domain. The expression of a GAL1 lacZ reporter gene under control of a GAL4 activated promoter depends on reconstitution of GAL4 activity via protein protein interaction. Colonies containing interacting polypeptides are detected with a chromogenic substrate for galactosidase. A complete kit MATCHMAKER for identifying protein protein interactions between two specific proteins using the two hybrid technique is commercially available from Clontech. This system can also be extended to map protein domains involved in specific protein interactions as well as to pinpoint amino acid residues that are crucial for these interactions.

Compounds that interfere with the interaction of a gene encoding a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide identified herein and other intra or extracellular components can be tested as follows usually a reaction mixture is prepared containing the product of the gene and the intra or extracellular component under conditions and for a time allowing for the interaction and binding of the two products. To test the ability of a candidate compound to inhibit binding the reaction is run in the absence and in the presence of the test compound. In addition a placebo may be added to a third reaction mixture to serve as positive control. The binding complex formation between the test compound and the intra or extracellular component present in the mixture is monitored as described hereinabove. The formation of a complex in the control reaction s but not in the reaction mixture containing the test compound indicates that the test compound interferes with the interaction of the test compound and its reaction partner.

To assay for antagonists the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide may be added to a cell along with the compound to be screened for a particular activity and the ability of the compound to inhibit the activity of interest in the presence of the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide indicates that the compound is an antagonist to the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide. Alternatively antagonists may be detected by combining the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide and a potential antagonist with membrane bound PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide receptors or recombinant receptors under appropriate conditions for a competitive inhibition assay. The PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide can be labeled such as by radioactivity such that the number of PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide molecules bound to the receptor can be used to determine the effectiveness of the potential antagonist. The gene encoding the receptor can be identified by numerous methods known to those of skill in the art for example ligand panning and FACS sorting. Coligan et al. 1 2 Chapter 5 1991 . Preferably expression cloning is employed wherein polyadenylated RNA is prepared from a cell responsive to the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide and a cDNA library created from this RNA is divided into pools and used to transfect COS cells or other cells that are not responsive to the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide. Transfected cells that are grown on glass slides are exposed to labeled PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide. The PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide can be labeled by a variety of means including iodination or inclusion of a recognition site for a site specific protein kinase. Following fixation and incubation the slides are subjected to autoradiographic analysis. Positive pools are identified and sub pools are prepared and re transfected using an interactive sub pooling and re screening process eventually yielding a single clone that encodes the putative receptor.

As an alternative approach for receptor identification the labeled PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide can be photoaffinity linked with cell membrane or extract preparations that express the receptor molecule. Cross linked material is resolved by PAGE and exposed to X ray film. The labeled complex containing the receptor can be excised resolved into peptide fragments and subjected to protein micro sequencing. The amino acid sequence obtained from micro sequencing would be used to design a set of degenerate oligonucleotide probes to screen a cDNA library to identify the gene encoding the putative receptor.

Another approach in assessing the effect of an antagonist to a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide would be administering a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 antagonist to a wild type mouse in order to mimic a known knockout phenotype. Thus one would initially knockout the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 gene of interest and observe the resultant phenotype as a consequence of knocking out or disrupting the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 gene. Subsequently one could then assess the effectiveness of an antagonist to the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide by administering an antagonist to the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide to a wild type mouse. An effective antagonist would be expected to mimic the phenotypic effect that was initially observed in the knockout animal.

Likewise one could assess the effect of an agonist to a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide by administering a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 agonist to a non human transgenic mouse in order to ameliorate a known negative knockout phenotype. Thus one would initially knockout the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 gene of interest and observe the resultant phenotype as a consequence of knocking out or disrupting the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 gene. Subsequently one could then assess the effectiveness of an agonist to the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide by administering an agonist to the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide to a the non human transgenic mouse. An effective agonist would be expected to ameliorate the negative phenotypic effect that was initially observed in the knockout animal

In another assay for antagonists mammalian cells or a membrane preparation expressing the receptor would be incubated with a labeled PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide in the presence of the candidate compound. The ability of the compound to enhance or block this interaction could then be measured.

More specific examples of potential antagonists include an oligonucleotide that binds to the fusions of immunoglobulin with the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide and in particular antibodies including without limitation poly and monoclonal antibodies and antibody fragments single chain antibodies anti idiotypic antibodies and chimeric or humanized versions of such antibodies or fragments as well as human antibodies and antibody fragments. Alternatively a potential antagonist may be a closely related protein for example a mutated form of the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide that recognizes the receptor but imparts no effect thereby competitively inhibiting the action of the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide.

Another potential PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide antagonist is an antisense RNA or DNA construct prepared using antisense technology where e.g. an antisense RNA or DNA molecule acts to block directly the translation of mRNA by hybridizing to targeted mRNA and preventing protein translation. Antisense technology can be used to control gene expression through triple helix formation or antisense DNA or RNA both of which methods are based on binding of a polynucleotide to DNA or RNA. For example the 5 coding portion of the polynucleotide sequence which encodes the mature PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides herein is used to design an antisense RNA oligonucleotide of from about 10 to 40 base pairs in length. A DNA oligonucleotide is designed to be complementary to a region of the gene involved in transcription triple helix see Lee et al. 6 3073 1979 Cooney et al. 241 456 1988 Dervan et al. 251 1360 1991 thereby preventing transcription and the production of the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide. The antisense RNA oligonucleotide hybridizes to the mRNA in vivo and blocks translation of the mRNA molecule into the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide antisense Okano 56 560 1991 CRC Press Boca Raton Fla. 1988 . The oligonucleotides described above can also be delivered to cells such that the antisense RNA or DNA may be expressed in vivo to inhibit production of the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide. When antisense DNA is used oligodeoxyribonucleotides derived from the translation initiation site e.g. between about 10 and 10 positions of the target gene nucleotide sequence are preferred.

Potential antagonists include small molecules that bind to the active site the receptor binding site or growth factor or other relevant binding site of the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide thereby blocking the normal biological activity of the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide. Examples of small molecules include but are not limited to small peptides or peptide like molecules preferably soluble peptides and synthetic non peptidyl organic or inorganic compounds.

Ribozymes are enzymatic RNA molecules capable of catalyzing the specific cleavage of RNA. Ribozymes act by sequence specific hybridization to the complementary target RNA followed by endonucleolytic cleavage. Specific ribozyme cleavage sites within a potential RNA target can be identified by known techniques. For further details see e.g. Rossi 4 469 471 1994 and PCT publication No. WO 97 33551 published Sep. 18 1997 .

Nucleic acid molecules in triple helix formation used to inhibit transcription should be single stranded and composed of deoxynucleotides. The base composition of these oligonucleotides is designed such that it promotes triple helix formation via Hoogsteen base pairing rules which generally require sizeable stretches of purines or pyrimidines on one strand of a duplex. For further details see e.g. PCT publication No. WO 97 33551 supra.

These small molecules can be identified by any one or more of the screening assays discussed hereinabove and or by any other screening techniques well known for those skilled in the art.

Diagnostic and therapeutic uses of the herein disclosed molecules may also be based upon the positive functional assay hits disclosed and described below.

F. Anti PRO227 Anti PRO233 Anti PRO238 Anti PRO1328 Anti PRO4342 Anti PRO7423 Anti PRO10096 Anti PRO21384 Anti PRO353 or Anti PRO1885 Antibodies

The present invention provides anti PRO227 anti PRO233 anti PRO238 anti PRO1328 anti PRO4342 anti PRO7423 anti PRO10096 anti PRO21384 anti PRO353 or anti PRO1885 antibodies which may find use herein as therapeutic and or diagnostic agents. Exemplary antibodies include polyclonal monoclonal humanized bispecific and heteroconjugate antibodies.

Polyclonal antibodies are preferably raised in animals by multiple subcutaneous sc or intraperitoneal ip injections of the relevant antigen and an adjuvant. It may be useful to conjugate the relevant antigen especially when synthetic peptides are used to a protein that is immunogenic in the species to be immunized. For example the antigen can be conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin KLH serum albumin bovine thyroglobulin or soybean trypsin inhibitor using a bifunctional or derivatizing agent e.g. maleimidobenzoyl sulfosuccinimide ester conjugation through cysteine residues N hydroxysuccinimide through lysine residues glutaraldehyde succinic anhydride SOCl or RN C NR where R and Rare different alkyl groups.

Animals are immunized against the antigen immunogenic conjugates or derivatives by combining e.g. 100 g or 5 g of the protein or conjugate for rabbits or mice respectively with 3 volumes of Freund s complete adjuvant and injecting the solution intradermally at multiple sites. One month later the animals are boosted with to 1 10 the original amount of peptide or conjugate in Freund s complete adjuvant by subcutaneous injection at multiple sites. Seven to 14 days later the animals are bled and the serum is assayed for antibody titer. Animals are boosted until the titer plateaus. Conjugates also can be made in recombinant cell culture as protein fusions. Also aggregating agents such as alum are suitably used to enhance the immune response.

Monoclonal antibodies may be made using the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al. 256 495 1975 or may be made by recombinant DNA methods U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 .

In the hybridoma method a mouse or other appropriate host animal such as a hamster is immunized as described above to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the protein used for immunization. Alternatively lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro. After immunization lymphocytes are isolated and then fused with a myeloma cell line using a suitable fusing agent such as polyethylene glycol to form a hybridoma cell Goding pp. 59 103 Academic Press 1986 .

The hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium which medium preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused parental myeloma cells also referred to as fusion partner . For example if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase HGPRT or HPRT the selective culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine aminopterin and thymidine HAT medium which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT deficient cells.

Preferred fusion partner myeloma cells are those that fuse efficiently support stable high level production of antibody by the selected antibody producing cells and are sensitive to a selective medium that selects against the unfused parental cells. Preferred myeloma cell lines are murine myeloma lines such as those derived from MOPC 21 and MPC 11 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center San Diego Calif. USA and SP 2 and derivatives e.g. X63 Ag8 653 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection Manassas Va. USA. Human myeloma and mouse human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies Kozbor 133 3001 1984 and Brodeur et al. pp. 51 63 Marcel Dekker Inc. New York 1987 .

Culture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen. Preferably the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay such as radioimmunoassay RIA or enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA .

The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can for example be determined by the Scatchard analysis described in Munson et al. 107 220 1980 .

Once hybridoma cells that produce antibodies of the desired specificity affinity and or activity are identified the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods Goding pp. 59 103 Academic Press 1986 . Suitable culture media for this purpose include for example D MEM or RPMI 1640 medium. In addition the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites tumors in an animal e.g. by i.p. injection of the cells into mice.

The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium ascites fluid or serum by conventional antibody purification procedures such as for example affinity chromatography e.g. using protein A or protein G Sepharose or ion exchange chromatography hydroxylapatite chromatography gel electrophoresis dialysis etc.

DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures e.g. by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies . The hybridoma cells serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated the DNA may be placed into expression vectors which are then transfected into host cells such as cells simian COS cells Chinese Hamster Ovary CHO cells or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce antibody protein to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. Review articles on recombinant expression in bacteria of DNA encoding the antibody include Skerra et al. 5 256 262 1993 and Pl ckthun 130 151 188 1992 .

Monoclonal antibodies or antibody fragments can be isolated from antibody phage libraries generated using the techniques described in McCafferty et al. 348 552 554 1990 . Clackson et al. 352 624 628 1991 and Marks et al. 222 581 597 1991 describe the isolation of murine and human antibodies respectively using phage libraries. Subsequent publications describe the production of high affinity nM range human antibodies by chain shuffling Marks et al. 10 779 783 1992 as well as combinatorial infection and in vivo recombination as a strategy for constructing very large phage libraries Waterhouse et al. 21 2265 2266 1993 . Thus these techniques are viable alternatives to traditional monoclonal antibody hybridoma techniques for isolation of monoclonal antibodies.

The DNA that encodes the antibody may be modified to produce chimeric or fusion antibody polypeptides for example by substituting human heavy chain and light chain constant domain Cand C sequences for the homologous murine sequences U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 and Morrison et al. 81 6851 1984 or by fusing the immunoglobulin coding sequence with all or part of the coding sequence for a non immunoglobulin polypeptide heterologous polypeptide . The non immunoglobulin polypeptide sequences can substitute for the constant domains of an antibody or they are substituted for the variable domains of one antigen combining site of an antibody to create a chimeric bivalent antibody comprising one antigen combining site having specificity for an antigen and another antigen combining site having specificity for a different antigen.

The anti PRO227 anti PRO233 anti PRO238 anti PRO1328 anti PRO4342 anti PRO7423 anti PRO10096 anti PRO21384 anti PRO353 or anti PRO1885 antibodies of the invention may further comprise humanized antibodies or human antibodies. Humanized forms of non human e.g. murine antibodies are chimeric immunoglobulins immunoglobulin chains or fragments thereof such as Fv Fab Fab F ab or other antigen binding subsequences of antibodies which contain minimal sequence derived from non human immunoglobulin. Humanized antibodies include human immunoglobulins recipient antibody in which residues from a complementary determining region CDR of the recipient are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non human species donor antibody such as mouse rat or rabbit having the desired specificity affinity and capacity. In some instances Fv framework residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non human residues. Humanized antibodies may also comprise residues which are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. In general the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one and typically two variable domains in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. The humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region Fc typically that of a human immunoglobulin Jones et al. 321 522 525 1986 Riechmann et al. 332 323 329 1988 and Presta 2 593 596 1992 .

Methods for humanizing non human antibodies are well known in the art. Generally a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non human. These non human amino acid residues are often referred to as import residues which are typically taken from an import variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co workers Jones et al. 321 522 525 1986 Riechmann et al. 332 323 327 1988 Verhoeyen et al. 239 1534 1536 1988 by substituting rodent CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly such humanized antibodies are chimeric antibodies U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non human species. In practice humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some CDR residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.

The choice of human variable domains both light and heavy to be used in making the humanized antibodies is very important to reduce antigenicity and HAMA response human anti mouse antibody when the antibody is intended for human therapeutic use. According to the so called best fit method the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire library of known human variable domain sequences. The human V domain sequence which is closest to that of the rodent is identified and the human framework region FR within it accepted for the humanized antibody Sims et al. 151 2296 1993 Chothia et al. 196 901 1987 . Another method uses a particular framework region derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework may be used for several different humanized antibodies Carter et al. 89 4285 1992 Presta et al. 151 2623 1993 .

It is further important that antibodies be humanized with retention of high binding affinity for the antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal according to a preferred method humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence i.e. the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way FR residues can be selected and combined from the recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic such as increased affinity for the target antigen s is achieved. In general the hypervariable region residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding.

Various forms of a humanized anti PRO227 anti PRO233 anti PRO238 anti PRO1328 anti PRO4342 anti PRO7423 anti PRO10096 anti PRO21384 anti PRO353 or anti PRO1885 antibody are contemplated. For example the humanized antibody may be an antibody fragment such as a Fab which is optionally conjugated with one or more cytotoxic agent s in order to generate an immunoconjugate. Alternatively the humanized antibody may be an intact antibody such as an intact IgG1 antibody.

As an alternative to humanization human antibodies can be generated. For example it is now possible to produce transgenic animals e.g. mice that are capable upon immunization of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. For example it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy chain joining region J gene in chimeric and germ line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production. Transfer of the human germ line immunoglobulin gene array into such germ line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge. See e.g. Jakobovits et al. 90 2551 1993 Jakobovits et al. 362 255 258 1993 Bruggemann et al. 7 33 1993 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 545 806 5 569 825 5 591 669 all of GenPharm 5 545 807 and WO 97 17852.

Alternatively phage display technology McCafferty et al. 348 552 553 1990 can be used to produce human antibodies and antibody fragments in vitro from immunoglobulin variable V domain gene repertoires from unimmunized donors. According to this technique antibody V domain genes are cloned in frame into either a major or minor coat protein gene of a filamentous bacteriophage such as M13 or fd and displayed as functional antibody fragments on the surface of the phage particle. Because the filamentous particle contains a single stranded DNA copy of the phage genome selections based on the functional properties of the antibody also result in selection of the gene encoding the antibody exhibiting those properties. Thus the phage mimics some of the properties of the B cell. Phage display can be performed in a variety of formats reviewed in e.g. Johnson Kevin S and Chiswell David J. 3 564 571 1993 . Several sources of V gene segments can be used for phage display. Clackson et al. 352 624 628 1991 isolated a diverse array of anti oxazolone antibodies from a small random combinatorial library of V genes derived from the spleens of immunized mice. A repertoire of V genes from unimmunized human donors can be constructed and antibodies to a diverse array of antigens including self antigens can be isolated essentially following the techniques described by Marks et al. 222 581 597 1991 or Griffith et al. 12 725 734 1993 . See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 565 332 and 5 573 905.

As discussed above human antibodies may also be generated by in vitro activated B cells see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 567 610 and 5 229 275 .

In certain circumstances there are advantages of using antibody fragments rather than whole antibodies. The smaller size of the fragments allows for rapid clearance and may lead to improved access to solid tumors.

Various techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments. Traditionally these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies see e.g. Morimoto et al. 24 107 117 1992 and Brennan et al. 229 81 1985 . However these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells. Fab Fv and ScFv antibody fragments can all be expressed in and secreted from thus allowing the facile production of large amounts of these fragments. Antibody fragments can be isolated from the antibody phage libraries discussed above. Alternatively Fab SH fragments can be directly recovered from and chemically coupled to form F ab fragments Carter et al. 10 163 167 1992 . According to another approach F ab fragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Fab and F ab fragment with increased in vivo half life comprising a salvage receptor binding epitope residues are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 869 046. Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner. The antibody of choice is a single chain Fv fragment scFv . See WO 93 16185 U.S. Pat. No. 5 571 894 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 587 458. Fv and sFv are the only species with intact combining sites that are devoid of constant regions thus they are suitable for reduced nonspecific binding during in vivo use. sFv fusion proteins may be constructed to yield fusion of an effector protein at either the amino or the carboxy terminus of an sFv. See ed. Borrebaeck supra. The antibody fragment may also be a linear antibody e.g. as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 641 870 for example. Such linear antibody fragments may be monospecific or bispecific.

Bispecific antibodies are antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different epitopes. Exemplary bispecific antibodies may bind to two different epitopes of a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 protein as described herein. Other such antibodies may combine a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 binding site with a binding site for another protein. Alternatively an anti PRO227 anti PRO233 anti PRO238 anti PRO1328 anti PRO4342 anti PRO7423 anti PRO10096 anti PRO21384 anti PRO353 or anti PRO1885 arm may be combined with an arm which binds to a triggering molecule on a leukocyte such as a T cell receptor molecule e.g. CD3 or Fc receptors for IgG Fc R such as Fc RI CD64 Fc RII CD32 and Fc RIII CD16 so as to focus and localize cellular defense mechanisms to the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 expressing cell. Bispecific antibodies may also be used to localize cytotoxic agents to cells which express a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide. These antibodies possess a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 binding arm and an arm which binds the cytotoxic agent e.g. saporin anti interferon vinca alkaloid ricin A chain methotrexate or radioactive isotope hapten . Bispecific antibodies can be prepared as full length antibodies or antibody fragments e.g. F ab bispecific antibodies .

WO 96 16673 describes a bispecific anti ErbB2 anti Fc RIII antibody and U.S. Pat. No. 5 837 234 discloses a bispecific anti ErbB2 anti Fc RI antibody. A bispecific anti ErbB2 Fc antibody is shown in WO98 02463. U.S. Pat. No. 5 821 337 teaches a bispecific anti ErbB2 anti CD3 antibody.

Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditional production of full length bispecific antibodies is based on the co expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain light chain pairs where the two chains have different specificities Millstein et al. 305 537 539 1983 . Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains these hybridomas quadromas produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. Purification of the correct molecule which is usually done by affinity chromatography steps is rather cumbersome and the product yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 93 08829 and in Traunecker et al. 10 3655 3659 1991 .

According to a different approach antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificity antibody antigen combining sites are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. Preferably the fusion is with an Ig heavy chain constant domain comprising at least part of the hinge C2 and C3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy chain constant region C1 containing the site necessary for light chain bonding present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and if desired the immunoglobulin light chain are inserted into separate expression vectors and are co transfected into a suitable host cell. This provides for greater flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yield of the desired bispecific antibody. It is however possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains into a single expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios have no significant affect on the yield of the desired chain combination.

The invention provides bispecific antibodies which are composed of a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain light chain pair providing a second binding specificity in the other arm. It was found that this asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation. This approach is disclosed in WO 94 04690. For further details of generating bispecific antibodies see for example Suresh et al. 121 210 1986 .

According to another approach described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 731 168 the interface between a pair of antibody molecules can be engineered to maximize the percentage of heterodimers which are recovered from recombinant cell culture. The preferred interface comprises at least a part of the C3 domain. In this method one or more small amino acid side chains from the interface of the first antibody molecule are replaced with larger side chains e.g. tyrosine or tryptophan . Compensatory cavities of identical or similar size to the large side chain s are created on the interface of the second antibody molecule by replacing large amino acid side chains with smaller ones e.g. alanine or threonine . This provides a mechanism for increasing the yield of the heterodimer over other unwanted end products such as homodimers.

Bispecific antibodies include cross linked or heteroconjugate antibodies. For example one of the antibodies in the heteroconjugate can be coupled to avidin the other to biotin. Such antibodies have for example been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 and for treatment of HIV infection WO 91 00360 WO 92 200373 and EP 03089 . Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using any convenient cross linking methods. Suitable cross linking agents are well known in the art and are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 along with a number of cross linking techniques.

Techniques for generating bispecific antibodies from antibody fragments have also been described in the literature. For example bispecific antibodies can be prepared using chemical linkage. Brennan et al. 229 81 1985 describe a procedure wherein intact antibodies are proteolytically cleaved to generate F ab fragments. These fragments are reduced in the presence of the dithiol complexing agent sodium arsenite to stabilize vicinal dithiols and prevent intermolecular disulfide formation. The Fab fragments generated are then converted to thionitrobenzoate TNB derivatives. One of the Fab TNB derivatives is then reconverted to the Fab thiol by reduction with mercaptoethylamine and is mixed with an equimolar amount of the other Fab TNB derivative to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibodies produced can be used as agents for the selective immobilization of enzymes.

Recent progress has facilitated the direct recovery of Fab SH fragments from which can be chemically coupled to form bispecific antibodies. Shalaby et al. 175 217 225 1992 describe the production of a fully humanized bispecific antibody F ab molecule. Each Fab fragment was separately secreted from and subjected to directed chemical coupling in vitro to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibody thus formed was able to bind to cells overexpressing the ErbB2 receptor and normal human T cells as well as trigger the lytic activity of human cytotoxic lymphocytes against human breast tumor targets. Various techniques for making and isolating bispecific antibody fragments directly from recombinant cell culture have also been described. For example bispecific antibodies have been produced using leucine zippers. Kostelny et al. 148 5 1547 1553 1992 . The leucine zipper peptides from the Fos and Jun proteins were linked to the Fab portions of two different antibodies by gene fusion. The antibody homodimers were reduced at the hinge region to form monomers and then re oxidized to form the antibody heterodimers. This method can also be utilized for the production of antibody homodimers. The diabody technology described by Hollinger et al. 90 6444 6448 1993 has provided an alternative mechanism for making bispecific antibody fragments. The fragments comprise a Vconnected to a Vby a linker which is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain. Accordingly the Vand Vdomains of one fragment are forced to pair with the complementary Vand Vdomains of another fragment thereby forming two antigen binding sites. Another strategy for making bispecific antibody fragments by the use of single chain Fv sFv dimers has also been reported. See Gruber et al. 152 5368 1994 .

Antibodies with more than two valencies are contemplated. For example trispecific antibodies can be prepared. Tutt et al. 147 60 1991 .

Heteroconjugate antibodies are also within the scope of the present invention. Heteroconjugate antibodies are composed of two covalently joined antibodies. Such antibodies have for example been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 and for treatment of HIV infection WO 91 00360 WO 92 200373 EP 03089 . It is contemplated that the antibodies may be prepared in vitro using known methods in synthetic protein chemistry including those involving crosslinking agents. For example immunotoxins may be constructed using a disulfide exchange reaction or by forming a thioether bond. Examples of suitable reagents for this purpose include iminothiolate and methyl 4 mercaptobutyrimidate and those disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980.

A multivalent antibody may be internalized and or catabolized faster than a bivalent antibody by a cell expressing an antigen to which the antibodies bind. The antibodies of the present invention can be multivalent antibodies which are other than of the IgM class with three or more antigen binding sites e.g. tetravalent antibodies which can be readily produced by recombinant expression of nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide chains of the antibody. The multivalent antibody can comprise a dimerization domain and three or more antigen binding sites. The preferred dimerization domain comprises or consists of an Fc region or a hinge region. In this scenario the antibody will comprise an Fc region and three or more antigen binding sites amino terminal to the Fc region. The preferred multivalent antibody herein comprises or consists of three to about eight but preferably four antigen binding sites. The multivalent antibody comprises at least one polypeptide chain and preferably two polypeptide chains wherein the polypeptide chain s comprise two or more variable domains. For instance the polypeptide chain s may comprise VD1 X1 VD2 X2 Fc wherein VD1 is a first variable domain VD2 is a second variable domain Fc is one polypeptide chain of an Fc region X1 and X2 represent an amino acid or polypeptide and n is 0 or 1. For instance the polypeptide chain s may comprise VH CH1 flexible linker VH CH1 Fc region chain or VH CH1 VH CH1 Fc region chain. The multivalent antibody herein preferably further comprises at least two and preferably four light chain variable domain polypeptides. The multivalent antibody herein may for instance comprise from about two to about eight light chain variable domain polypeptides. The light chain variable domain polypeptides contemplated here comprise a light chain variable domain and optionally further comprise a CL domain.

It may be desirable to modify the antibody of the invention with respect to effector function e.g. so as to enhance antigen dependent cell mediated cyotoxicity ADCC and or complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC of the antibody. This may be achieved by introducing one or more amino acid substitutions in an Fc region of the antibody. Alternatively or additionally cysteine residue s may be introduced in the Fc region thereby allowing interchain disulfide bond formation in this region. The homodimeric antibody thus generated may have improved internalization capability and or increased complement mediated cell killing and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ADCC . See Caron et al. 176 1191 1195 1992 and Shopes B. 148 2918 2922 1992 . Homodimeric antibodies with enhanced anti tumor activity may also be prepared using heterobifunctional cross linkers as described in Wolff et al. 53 2560 2565 1993 . Alternatively an antibody can be engineered which has dual Fc regions and may thereby have enhanced complement lysis and ADCC capabilities. See Stevenson et al. 3 219 230 1989 . To increase the serum half life of the antibody one may incorporate a salvage receptor binding epitope into the antibody especially an antibody fragment as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 739 277 for example. As used herein the term salvage receptor binding epitope refers to an epitope of the Fc region of an IgG molecule e.g. IgG IgG IgG or IgG that is responsible for increasing the in vivo serum half life of the IgG molecule.

The invention also pertains to immunoconjugates comprising an antibody conjugated to a cytotoxic agent such as a chemotherapeutic agent a growth inhibitory agent a toxin e.g. an enzymatically active toxin of bacterial fungal plant or animal origin or fragments thereof or a radioactive isotope i.e. a radioconjugate .

Chemotherapeutic agents useful in the generation of such immunoconjugates have been described above. Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof that can be used include diphtheria A chain nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin exotoxin A chain from ricin A chain abrin A chain modeccin A chain alpha sarcin proteins dianthin proteins proteins PAPI PAPII and PAP S momordica charantia inhibitor curcin crotin sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor gelonin mitogellin restrictocin phenomycin enomycin and the tricothecenes. A variety of radionuclides are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Examples include Bi I In Y and Re. Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent are made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithiol propionate SPDP iminothiolane TT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCL active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutareldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bis p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as tolyene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene . For example a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al. 238 1098 1987 . Carbon 14 labeled 1 isothiocyanatobenzyl 3 methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid MX DTPA is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94 11026.

Conjugates of an antibody and one or more small molecule toxins such as a calicheamicin maytansinoids a trichothene and CC1065 and the derivatives of these toxins that have toxin activity are also contemplated herein.

The invention provides an anti PRO227 anti PRO233 anti PRO238 anti PRO1328 anti PRO4342 anti PRO7423 anti PRO10096 anti PRO21384 anti PRO353 or anti PRO1885 antibody full length or fragments which is conjugated to one or more maytansinoid molecules.

Maytansinoids are mitototic inhibitors which act by inhibiting tubulin polymerization. Maytansine was first isolated from the east African shrub U.S. Pat. No. 3 896 111 . Subsequently it was discovered that certain microbes also produce maytansinoids such as maytansinol and C 3 maytansinol esters U.S. Pat. No. 4 151 042 . Synthetic maytansinol and derivatives and analogues thereof are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 137 230 4 248 870 4 256 746 4 260 608 4 265 814 4 294 757 4 307 016 4 308 268 4 308 269 4 309 428 4 313 946 4 315 929 4 317 821 4 322 348 4 331 598 4 361 650 4 364 866 4 424 219 4 450 254 4 362 663 and 4 371 533 the disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference.

In an attempt to improve their therapeutic index maytansine and maytansinoids have been conjugated to antibodies specifically binding to tumor cell antigens. Immunoconjugates containing maytansinoids and their therapeutic use are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 208 020 5 416 064 and European Patent EP 0 425 235 B1 the disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. Liu et al. 93 8618 8623 1996 described immunoconjugates comprising a maytansinoid designated DM1 linked to the monoclonal antibody C242 directed against human colorectal cancer. The conjugate was found to be highly cytotoxic towards cultured colon cancer cells and showed antitumor activity in an in vivo tumor growth assay. Chari et al. 52 127 131 1992 describe immunoconjugates in which a maytansinoid was conjugated via a disulfide linker to the murine antibody A7 binding to an antigen on human colon cancer cell lines or to another murine monoclonal antibody TA.1 that binds the HER 2 neu oncogene. The cytotoxicity of the TA.1 maytansonoid conjugate was tested in vitro on the human breast cancer cell line SK BR 3 which expresses 3 10HER 2 surface antigens per cell. The drug conjugate achieved a degree of cytotoxicity similar to the free maytansonid drug which could be increased by increasing the number of maytansinoid molecules per antibody molecule. The A7 maytansinoid conjugate showed low systemic cytotoxicity in mice.

Anti PRO227 Anti PRO233 Anti PRO238 Anti PRO1328 Anti PRO4342 Anti PRO7423 anti PRO10096 anti PRO21384 anti PRO353 or Anti PRO1885 Antibody Maytansinoid Conjugates Immunoconjugates 

Anti PRO227 anti PRO233 anti PRO238 anti PRO1328 anti PRO4342 anti PRO7423 anti PRO10096 anti PRO21384 anti PRO353 or anti PRO1885 antibody maytansinoid conjugates are prepared by chemically linking an anti PRO227 anti PRO233 anti PRO238 anti PRO1328 anti PRO4342 anti PRO7423 anti PRO10096 anti PRO21384 anti PRO353 or anti PRO1885 antibody to a maytansinoid molecule without significantly diminishing the biological activity of either the antibody or the maytansinoid molecule. An average of 3 4 maytansinoid molecules conjugated per antibody molecule has shown efficacy in enhancing cytotoxicity of target cells without negatively affecting the function or solubility of the antibody although even one molecule of toxin antibody would be expected to enhance cytotoxicity over the use of naked antibody. Maytansinoids are well known in the art and can be synthesized by known techniques or isolated from natural sources. Suitable maytansinoids are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 and in the other patents and nonpatent publications referred to hereinabove. Preferred maytansinoids are maytansinol and maytansinol analogues modified in the aromatic ring or at other positions of the maytansinol molecule such as various maytansinol esters.

There are many linking groups known in the art for making antibody maytansinoid conjugates including for example those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 or EP Patent 0 425 235 B1 and Chari et al. 52 127 131 1992 . The linking groups include disulfide groups thioether groups acid labile groups photolabile groups peptidase labile groups or esterase labile groups as disclosed in the above identified patents disulfide and thioether groups being preferred.

Conjugates of the antibody and maytansinoid may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate iminothiolane IT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCL active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutareldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bis p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as toluene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene . Particularly preferred coupling agents include N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP Carlsson et al. 173 723 737 1978 and N succinimidyl 4 2 pyridylthio pentanoate SPP to provide for a disulfide linkage.

The linker may be attached to the maytansinoid molecule at various positions depending on the type of the link. For example an ester linkage may be formed by reaction with a hydroxyl group using conventional coupling techniques. The reaction may occur at the C 3 position having a hydroxyl group the C 14 position modified with hyrdoxymethyl the C 15 position modified with a hydroxyl group and the C 20 position having a hydroxyl group. The linkage is formed at the C 3 position of maytansinol or a maytansinol analogue.

Another immunoconjugate of interest comprises an anti PRO227 anti PRO233 anti PRO238 anti PRO1328 anti PRO4342 anti PRO7423 anti PRO10096 anti PRO21384 anti PRO353 or anti PRO1885 antibody conjugated to one or more calicheamicin molecules. The calicheamicin family of antibiotics are capable of producing double stranded DNA breaks at sub picomolar concentrations. For the preparation of conjugates of the calicheamicin family see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 712 374 5 714 586 5 739 116 5 767 285 5 770 701 5 770 710 5 773 001 5 877 296 all to American Cyanamid Company . Structural analogues of calicheamicin which may be used include but are not limited to N acetyl PSAG and Hinman et al. 53 3336 3342 1993 Lode et al. 58 2925 2928 1998 and the aforementioned U.S. patents to American Cyanamid . Another anti tumor drug that the antibody can be conjugated is QFA which is an antifolate. Both calicheamicin and QFA have intracellular sites of action and do not readily cross the plasma membrane. Therefore cellular uptake of these agents through antibody mediated internalization greatly enhances their cytotoxic effects.

Other antitumor agents that can be conjugated to the anti PRO227 anti PRO233 anti PRO238 anti PRO1328 anti PRO4342 anti PRO7423 anti PRO10096 anti PRO21384 anti PRO353 or anti PRO1885 antibodies of the invention include BCNU streptozoicin vincristine and 5 fluorouracil the family of agents known collectively LL E33288 complex described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 053 394 5 770 710 as well as esperamicins U.S. Pat. No. 5 877 296 .

Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof which can be used include diphtheria A chain nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin exotoxin A chain from ricin A chain abrin A chain modeccin A chain alpha sarcin proteins dianthin proteins proteins PAPI PAPII and PAP S momordica charantia inhibitor curcin crotin sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor gelonin mitogellin restrictocin phenomycin enomycin and the tricothecenes. See for example WO 93 21232 published Oct. 28 1993.

The present invention further contemplates an immunoconjugate formed between an antibody and a compound with nucleolytic activity e.g. a ribonuclease or a DNA endonuclease such as a deoxyribonuclease DNase .

For selective destruction of the tumor the antibody may comprise a highly radioactive atom. A variety of radioactive isotopes are available for the production of radioconjugated anti PRO227 anti PRO233 anti PRO238 anti PRO1328 anti PRO4342 anti PRO7423 anti PRO10096 anti PRO21384 anti PRO353 or anti PRO1885 antibodies. Examples include At I I Y Re Re Sm Bi P Pband radioactive isotopes of Lu. When the conjugate is used for diagnosis it may comprise a radioactive atom for scintigraphic studies for example tcor I or a spin label for nuclear magnetic resonance NMR imaging also known as magnetic resonance imaging mri such as iodine 123 again iodine 131 indium 111 fluorine 19 carbon 13 nitrogen 15 oxygen 17 gadolinium manganese or iron.

The radio or other labels may be incorporated in the conjugate in known ways. For example the peptide may be biosynthesized or may be synthesized by chemical amino acid synthesis using suitable amino acid precursors involving for example fluorine 19 in place of hydrogen. Labels such as tcor I Re Reand Incan be attached via a cysteine residue in the peptide. Yttrium 90 can be attached via a lysine residue. The IODOGEN method Fraker et al 1978 Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 80 49 57 can be used to incorporate iodine 123. Monoclonal Antibodies in Immunoscintigraphy Chatal CRC Press 1989 describes other methods in detail.

Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate iminothiolane IT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCL active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutareldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bis p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as tolyene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene . For example a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al. 238 1098 1987 . Carbon 14 labeled 1 isothiocyanatobenzyl 3 methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid MX DTPA is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94 11026. The linker may be a cleavable linker facilitating release of the cytotoxic drug in the cell. For example an acid labile linker peptidase sensitive linker photolabile linker dimethyl linker or disulfide containing linker Chari et al. 52 127 131 1992 U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 may be used.

Alternatively a fusion protein comprising the anti PRO227 anti PRO233 anti PRO238 anti PRO1328 anti PRO4342 anti PRO7423 anti PRO10096 anti PRO21384 anti PRO353 or anti PRO1885 antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made e.g. by recombinant techniques or peptide synthesis. The length of DNA may comprise respective regions encoding the two portions of the conjugate either adjacent one another or separated by a region encoding a linker peptide which does not destroy the desired properties of the conjugate.

The invention provides that the antibody may be conjugated to a receptor such streptavidin for utilization in tumor pre targeting wherein the antibody receptor conjugate is administered to the patient followed by removal of unbound conjugate from the circulation using a clearing agent and then administration of a ligand e.g. avidin which is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent e.g. a radionucleotide .

The anti PRO227 anti PRO233 anti PRO238 anti PRO1328 anti PRO4342 anti PRO7423 anti PRO10096 anti PRO21384 anti PRO353 or anti PRO1885 antibodies disclosed herein may also be formulated as immunoliposomes. A liposome is a small vesicle composed of various types of lipids phospholipids and or surfactant which is useful for delivery of a drug to a mammal. The components of the liposome are commonly arranged in a bilayer formation similar to the lipid arrangement of biological membranes. Liposomes containing the antibody are prepared by methods known in the art such as described in Epstein et al. 82 3688 1985 Hwang et al. 77 4030 1980 U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 485 045 and 4 544 545 and WO97 38731 published Oct. 23 1997. Liposomes with enhanced circulation time are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 013 556.

Particularly useful liposomes can be generated by the reverse phase evaporation method with a lipid composition comprising phosphatidylcholine cholesterol and PEG derivatized phosphatidylethanolamine PEG PE . Liposomes are extruded through filters of defined pore size to yield liposomes with the desired diameter. Fab fragments of the antibody of the present invention can be conjugated to the liposomes as described in Martin et al. 257 286 288 1982 via a disulfide interchange reaction. A chemotherapeutic agent is optionally contained within the liposome. See Gabizon et al. 81 19 1484 1989 .

Antibodies specifically binding a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide identified herein as well as other molecules identified by the screening assays disclosed hereinbefore can be administered for the treatment of various disorders in the form of pharmaceutical compositions.

If the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide is intracellular and whole antibodies are used as inhibitors internalizing antibodies are preferred. However lipofections or liposomes can also be used to deliver the antibody or an antibody fragment into cells. Where antibody fragments are used the smallest inhibitory fragment that specifically binds to the binding domain of the target protein is preferred. For example based upon the variable region sequences of an antibody peptide molecules can be designed that retain the ability to bind the target protein sequence. Such peptides can be synthesized chemically and or produced by recombinant DNA technology. See e.g. Marasco et al. 90 7889 7893 1993 . The formulation herein may also contain more than one active compound as necessary for the particular indication being treated preferably those with complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other. Alternatively or in addition the composition may comprise an agent that enhances its function such as for example a cytotoxic agent cytokine chemotherapeutic agent or growth inhibitory agent. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended.

The active ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared for example by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization for example hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin microcapsules and poly methylmethacylate microcapsules respectively in colloidal drug delivery systems for example liposomes albumin microspheres microemulsions nano particles and nanocapsules or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in Remington s supra.

The formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.

Sustained release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the antibody which matrices are in the form of shaped articles e.g. films or microcapsules. Examples of sustained release matrices include polyesters hydrogels for example poly 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate or poly vinylalcohol polylactides U.S. Pat. No. 3 773 919 copolymers of L glutamic acid and ethyl L glutamate non degradable ethylene vinyl acetate degradable lactic acid glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate and poly D 3 hydroxybutyric acid. While polymers such as ethylene vinyl acetate and lactic acid glycolic acid enable release of molecules for over 100 days certain hydrogels release proteins for shorter time periods. When encapsulated antibodies remain in the body for a long time they may denature or aggregate as a result of exposure to moisture at 37 C. resulting in a loss of biological activity and possible changes in immunogenicity. Rational strategies can be devised for stabilization depending on the mechanism involved. For example if the aggregation mechanism is discovered to be intermolecular S S bond formation through thio disulfide interchange stabilization may be achieved by modifying sulfhydryl residues lyophilizing from acidic solutions controlling moisture content using appropriate additives and developing specific polymer matrix compositions.

G. Uses for Anti PRO227 Anti PRO233 Anti PRO238 Anti PRO1328 Anti PRO4342 Anti PRO7423 Anti PRO10096 Anti PRO21384 Anti PRO353 or Anti PRO1885 Antibodies

The anti PRO227 anti PRO233 anti PRO238 anti PRO1328 anti PRO4342 anti PRO7423 anti PRO10096 anti PRO21384 anti PRO353 or anti PRO1885 antibodies of the invention have various therapeutic and or diagnostic utilities for a neurological disorder a cardiovascular endothelial or angiogenic disorder an immunological disorder an oncological disorder an embryonic developmental disorder or lethality or a metabolic abnormality. For example anti PRO227 anti PRO233 anti PRO238 anti PRO1328 anti PRO4342 anti PRO7423 anti PRO10096 anti PRO21384 anti PRO353 or anti PRO1885 antibodies may be used in diagnostic assays for PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 e.g. detecting its expression and in some cases differential expression in specific cells tissues or serum. Various diagnostic assay techniques known in the art may be used such as competitive binding assays direct or indirect sandwich assays and immunoprecipitation assays conducted in either heterogeneous or homogeneous phases Zola CRC Press Inc. 1987 pp. 147 158 . The antibodies used in the diagnostic assays can be labeled with a detectable moiety. The detectable moiety should be capable of producing either directly or indirectly a detectable signal. For example the detectable moiety may be a radioisotope such as H C P S or I a fluorescent or chemiluminescent compound such as fluorescein isothiocyanate rhodamine or luciferin or an enzyme such as alkaline phosphatase beta galactosidase or horseradish peroxidase. Any method known in the art for conjugating the antibody to the detectable moiety may be employed including those methods described by Hunter et al. 144 945 1962 David et al. 13 1014 1974 Pain et al. 40 219 1981 and Nygren 30 407 1982 .

Anti PRO227 anti PRO233 anti PRO238 anti PRO1328 anti PRO4342 anti PRO7423 anti PRO10096 anti PRO21384 anti PRO353 or anti PRO1885 antibodies also are useful for the affinity purification of PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides from recombinant cell culture or natural sources. In this process the antibodies against PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides are immobilized on a suitable support such a Sephadex resin or filter paper using methods well known in the art. The immobilized antibody then is contacted with a sample containing the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide to be purified and thereafter the support is washed with a suitable solvent that will remove substantially all the material in the sample except the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide which is bound to the immobilized antibody. Finally the support is washed with another suitable solvent that will release the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide from the antibody.

The following examples are offered for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention in any way.

All patent and literature references cited in the present specification are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.

Commercially available reagents referred to in the examples were used according to manufacturer s instructions unless otherwise indicated. The source of those cells identified in the following examples and throughout the specification by ATCC accession numbers is the American Type Culture Collection Manassas Va.

The extracellular domain ECD sequences including the secretion signal sequence if any from about 950 known secreted proteins from the Swiss Prot public database were used to search EST databases. The EST databases included public databases e.g. Dayhoff GenBank and proprietary databases e.g. LIFESEQ Incyte Pharmaceuticals Palo Alto Calif. . The search was performed using the computer program BLAST or BLAST 2 Altschul et al. 266 460 480 1996 as a comparison of the ECD protein sequences to a 6 frame translation of the EST sequences. Those comparisons with a BLAST score of 70 or in some cases 90 or greater that did not encode known proteins were clustered and assembled into consensus DNA sequences with the program phrap Phil Green University of Washington Seattle Wash. .

Using this extracellular domain homology screen consensus DNA sequences were assembled relative to the other identified EST sequences using phrap. In addition the consensus DNA sequences obtained were often but not always extended using repeated cycles of BLAST or BLAST 2 and phrap to extend the consensus sequence as far as possible using the sources of EST sequences discussed above.

Based upon the consensus sequences obtained as described above oligonucleotides were then synthesized and used to identify by PCR a cDNA library that contained the sequence of interest and for use as probes to isolate a clone of the full length coding sequence for a PRO polypeptide. Forward and reverse PCR primers generally range from 20 to 30 nucleotides and are often designed to give a PCR product of about 100 1000 bp in length. The probe sequences are typically 40 55 bp in length. In some cases additional oligonucleotides are synthesized when the consensus sequence is greater than about 1 1.5 kbp. In order to screen several libraries for a full length clone DNA from the libraries was screened by PCR amplification as per Ausubel et al. with the PCR primer pair. A positive library was then used to isolate clones encoding the gene of interest using the probe oligonucleotide and one of the primer pairs.

The cDNA libraries used to isolate the cDNA clones were constructed by standard methods using commercially available reagents such as those from Invitrogen San Diego Calif. The cDNA was primed with oligo dT containing a NotI site linked with blunt to SalI hemikinased adaptors cleaved with NotI sized appropriately by gel electrophoresis and cloned in a defined orientation into a suitable cloning vector such as pRKB or pRKD pRK5B is a precursor of pRK5D that does not contain the SfiI site see Holmes et al. 253 1278 1280 1991 in the unique XhoI and NotI sites.

mRNA was isolated from a human tissue of interest using reagents and protocols from Invitrogen San Diego Calif. Fast Track 2 . This RNA was used to generate an oligo dT primed cDNA library in the vector pRK5D using reagents and protocols from Life Technologies Gaithersburg Md. Super Script Plasmid System . In this procedure the double stranded cDNA was sized to greater than 1000 bp and the SalI NotI linkered cDNA was cloned into XhoI NotI cleaved vector. pRK5D is a cloning vector that has an sp6 transcription initiation site followed by an SfiI restriction enzyme site preceding the XhoI NotI cDNA cloning sites.

A secondary cDNA library was generated in order to preferentially represent the 5 ends of the primary cDNA clones. Sp6 RNA was generated from the primary library described above and this RNA was used to generate a random primed cDNA library in the vector pSST AMY.0 using reagents and protocols from Life Technologies Super Script Plasmid System referenced above . In this procedure the double stranded cDNA was sized to 500 1000 bp linkered with blunt to NotI adaptors cleaved with SfiI and cloned into SfiI NotI cleaved vector. pSST AMY.0 is a cloning vector that has a yeast alcohol dehydrogenase promoter preceding the cDNA cloning sites and the mouse amylase sequence the mature sequence without the secretion signal followed by the yeast alcohol dehydrogenase terminator after the cloning sites. Thus cDNAs cloned into this vector that are fused in frame with amylase sequence will lead to the secretion of amylase from appropriately transfected yeast colonies.

DNA from the library described in paragraph 2 above was chilled on ice to which was added electrocompetent DH10B bacteria Life Technologies 20 ml . The bacteria and vector mixture was then electroporated as recommended by the manufacturer. Subsequently SOC media Life Technologies 1 ml was added and the mixture was incubated at 37 C. for 30 minutes. The transformants were then plated onto 20 standard 150 mm LB plates containing ampicillin and incubated for 16 hours 37 C. . Positive colonies were scraped off the plates and the DNA was isolated from the bacterial pellet using standard protocols e.g. CsCl gradient. The purified DNA was then carried on to the yeast protocols below.

The yeast methods were divided into three categories 1 Transformation of yeast with the plasmid cDNA combined vector 2 Detection and isolation of yeast clones secreting amylase and 3 PCR amplification of the insert directly from the yeast colony and purification of the DNA for sequencing and further analysis.

The yeast strain used was HD56 5A ATCC 90785 . This strain has the following genotype MAT alpha ura3 52 leu2 3 leu2 112 his3 11 his3 15 MAL SUC GAL. Preferably yeast mutants can be employed that have deficient post translational pathways. Such mutants may have translocation deficient alleles in sec71 sec72 sec62 with truncated sec71 being most preferred. Alternatively antagonists including antisense nucleotides and or ligands which interfere with the normal operation of these genes other proteins implicated in this post translation pathway e.g. SEC61p SEC72p SEC62p SEC63p TDJ1p or SSA1p 4p or the complex formation of these proteins may also be preferably employed in combination with the amylase expressing yeast.

Transformation was performed based on the protocol outlined by Gietz et al. 20 1425 1992 . Transformed cells were then inoculated from agar into YEPD complex media broth 100 ml and grown overnight at 30 C. The YEPD broth was prepared as described in Kaiser et al. Cold Spring Harbor Press Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. p. 207 1994 . The overnight culture was then diluted to about 2 10cells ml approx. OD 0.1 into fresh YEPD broth 500 ml and regrown to 1 10cells ml approx. OD 0.4 0.5 .

The cells were then harvested and prepared for transformation by transfer into GS3 rotor bottles in a Sorval GS3 rotor at 5 000 rpm for 5 minutes the supernatant discarded and then resuspended into sterile water and centrifuged again in 50 ml falcon tubes at 3 500 rpm in a Beckman GS 6KR centrifuge. The supernatant was discarded and the cells were subsequently washed with LiAc TE 10 ml 10 mM Tris HCl 1 mM EDTA pH 7.5 100 mM LiOOCCH and resuspended into LiAc TE 2.5 ml .

Transformation took place by mixing the prepared cells 100 l with freshly denatured single stranded salmon testes DNA Lofstrand Labs Gaithersburg Md. and transforming DNA 1 g vol. 

Alternatively instead of multiple small reactions the transformation was performed using a single large scale reaction wherein reagent amounts were scaled up accordingly.

The selective media used was a synthetic complete dextrose agar lacking uracil SCD Ura prepared as described in Kaiser et al. Cold Spring Harbor Press Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. p. 208 210 1994 . Transformants were grown at 30 C. for 2 3 days.

The detection of colonies secreting amylase was performed by including red starch in the selective growth media. Starch was coupled to the red dye Reactive Red 120 Sigma as per the procedure described by Biely et al. 172 176 179 1988 . The coupled starch was incorporated into the SCD Ura agar plates at a final concentration of 0.15 w v and was buffered with potassium phosphate to a pH of 7.0 50 100 mM final concentration .

The positive colonies were picked and streaked across fresh selective media onto 150 mm plates in order to obtain well isolated and identifiable single colonies. Well isolated single colonies positive for amylase secretion were detected by direct incorporation of red starch into buffered SCD Ura agar. Positive colonies were determined by their ability to break down starch resulting in a clear halo around the positive colony visualized directly.

When a positive colony was isolated a portion of it was picked by a toothpick and diluted into sterile water 30 l in a 96 well plate. At this time the positive colonies were either frozen and stored for subsequent analysis or immediately amplified. An aliquot of cells 5 l was used as a template for the PCR reaction in a 25 l volume containing 0.5 l Klentaq Clontech Palo Alto Calif. 4.0 l 10 mM dNTP s Perkin Elmer Cetus 2.5 l Kentaq buffer Clontech 0.25 l forward oligo 1 0.25 l reverse oligo 2 12.5 l distilled water. The sequence of the forward oligonucleotide 1 was 

The underlined regions of the oligonucleotides annealed to the ADH promoter region and the amylase region respectively and amplified a 307 bp region from vector pSST AMY.0 when no insert was present. Typically the first 18 nucleotides of the 5 end of these oligonucleotides contained annealing sites for the sequencing primers. Thus the total product of the PCR reaction from an empty vector was 343 bp. However signal sequence fused cDNA resulted in considerably longer nucleotide sequences.

Following the PCR an aliquot of the reaction 5 l was examined by agarose gel electrophoresis in a 1 agarose gel using a Tris Borate EDTA TBE buffering system as described by Sambrook et al. supra. Clones resulting in a single strong PCR product larger than 400 bp were further analyzed by DNA sequencing after purification with a 96 Qiaquick PCR clean up column Qiagen Inc. Chatsworth Calif. .

Various polypeptide encoding nucleic acid sequences were identified by applying a proprietary signal sequence finding algorithm developed by Genentech Inc. South San Francisco Calif. upon ESTs as well as clustered and assembled EST fragments from public e.g. GenBank and or private LIFESEQ Incyte Pharmaceuticals Inc. Palo Alto Calif. databases. The signal sequence algorithm computes a secretion signal score based on the character of the DNA nucleotides surrounding the first and optionally the second methionine codon s ATG at the 5 end of the sequence or sequence fragment under consideration. The nucleotides following the first ATG must code for at least 35 unambiguous amino acids without any stop codons. If the first ATG has the required amino acids the second is not examined. If neither meets the requirement the candidate sequence is not scored. In order to determine whether the EST sequence contains an authentic signal sequence the DNA and corresponding amino acid sequences surrounding the ATG codon are scored using a set of seven sensors evaluation parameters known to be associated with secretion signals. Use of this algorithm resulted in the identification of numerous polypeptide encoding nucleic acid sequences.

Using the techniques described in Examples 1 to 3 above numerous full length cDNA clones were identified as encoding PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides as disclosed herein.

The extracellular domain ECD sequences including the secretion signal if any of from about 950 known secreted proteins from the Swiss Prot public protein database were used to search expressed sequence tag EST databases. The EST databases included public EST databases e.g. GenBank and a proprietary EST DNA database LIFESEQ Incyte Pharmaceuticals Palo Alto Calif. . The search was performed using the computer program BLAST or BLAST2 Altshul et al. 266 460 480 1996 as a comparison of the ECD protein sequences to a 6 frame translation of the EST sequence. Those comparisons resulting in a BLAST score of 70 or in some cases 90 or greater that did not encode known proteins were clustered and assembled into consensus DNA sequences with the program phrap Phil Green University of Washington Seattle Wash. .

A consensus DNA sequence encoding PRO227 was assembled relative to the other identified EST sequences wherein the consensus sequence was designated herein as DNA28740.

An expressed sequence tag EST was identified by the EST database search and a consensus DNA sequence was assembled relative to other EST sequences using phrap Phil Green University of Washington Seattle Wash. . This consensus sequence is herein designated Consen0821 which was used to derive the final consensus sequence DNA30945 .

Based on the DNA30945 consensus sequence oligonucleotides were synthesized 1 to identify by PCR a cDNA library that contained the sequence of interest and 2 for use as probes to isolate a clone of the full length coding sequence for PRO233.

DNA66658 1584 was identified by applying a proprietary signal sequence finding algorithm developed by Genentech Inc. South San Francisco Calif. upon ESTs as well as clustered and assembled EST fragments from public e.g. GenBank and or private LIFESEQ Incyte Pharmaceuticals Inc. Palo Alto Calif. databases. The signal sequence algorithm computes a secretion signal score based on the character of the DNA nucleotides surrounding the first and optionally the second methionine codon s ATG at the 5 end of the sequence or sequence fragment under consideration. The nucleotides following the first ATG must code for at least 35 unambiguous amino acids without any stop codons. If the first ATG has the required amino acids the second is not examined. If neither meets the requirement the candidate sequence is not scored. In order to determine whether the EST sequence contains an authentic signal sequence the DNA and corresponding amino acid sequences surrounding the ATG codon are scored using a set of seven sensors evaluation parameters known to be associated with secretion signals.

mRNA was isolated from a human tissue of interest using reagents and protocols from Invitrogen San Diego Calif. Fast Track 2 . This RNA was used to generate an oligo dT primed cDNA library in the vector pRK5D using reagents and protocols from Life Technologies Gaithersburg Md. Super Script Plasmid System . In this procedure the double stranded cDNA was sized to greater than 1000 bp and the SalI NotI linkered cDNA was cloned into XhoI NotI cleaved vector. pRK5D is a cloning vector that has an sp6 transcription initiation site followed by an SfiI restriction enzyme site preceding the XhoI NotI cDNA cloning sites.

A secondary cDNA library was generated in order to preferentially represent the 5 ends of the primary cDNA clones. Sp6 RNA was generated from the primary library described above and this RNA was used to generate a random primed cDNA library in the vector pSST AMY.0 using reagents and protocols from Life Technologies Super Script Plasmid System referenced above . In this procedure the double stranded cDNA was sized to 500 1000 bp linkered with blunt to NotI adaptors cleaved with SfiI and cloned into SfiI NotI cleaved vector. pSST AMY.0 is a cloning vector that has a yeast alcohol dehydrogenase promoter preceding the cDNA cloning sites and the mouse amylase sequence the mature sequence without the secretion signal followed by the yeast alcohol dehydrogenase terminator after the cloning sites. Thus cDNAs cloned into this vector that are fused in frame with amylase sequence will lead to the secretion of amylase from appropriately transfected yeast colonies.

DNA from the library described in paragraph 2 above was chilled on ice to which was added electrocompetent DH10B bacteria Life Technologies 20 ml . The bacteria and vector mixture was then electroporated as recommended by the manufacturer. Subsequently SOC media Life Technologies 1 ml was added and the mixture was incubated at 37 C. for 30 minutes. The transformants were then plated onto 20 standard 150 mm LB plates containing ampicillin and incubated for 16 hours 37 C. . Positive colonies were scraped off the plates and the DNA was isolated from the bacterial pellet using standard protocols e.g. CsCl gradient. The purified DNA was then carried on to the yeast protocols below.

The yeast methods were divided into three categories 1 Transformation of yeast with the plasmid cDNA combined vector 2 Detection and isolation of yeast clones secreting amylase and 3 PCR amplification of the insert directly from the yeast colony and purification of the DNA for sequencing and further analysis.

The yeast strain used was HD56 5A ATCC 90785 . This strain has the following genotype MAT alpha ura3 52 leu2 3 leu2 112 his3 11 his3 15 MAL SUC GAL. Preferably yeast mutants can be employed that have deficient post translational pathways. Such mutants may have translocation deficient alleles in sec71 sec72 sec62 with truncated sec71 being most preferred. Alternatively antagonists including antisense nucleotides and or ligands which interfere with the normal operation of these genes other proteins implicated in this post translation pathway e.g. SEC61p SEC72p SEC62p SEC63p TDJ1p or SSA1p 4p or the complex formation of these proteins may also be preferably employed in combination with the amylase expressing yeast.

Transformation was performed based on the protocol outlined by Gietz et al. 20 1425 1992 . Transformed cells were then inoculated from agar into YEPD complex media broth 100 ml and grown overnight at 30 C. The YEPD broth was prepared as described in Kaiser et al. Cold Spring Harbor Press Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. p. 207 1994 . The overnight culture was then diluted to about 2 10cells ml approx. OD 0.1 into fresh YEPD broth 500 ml and regrown to 1 10cells ml approx. OD 0.4 0.5 .

The cells were then harvested and prepared for transformation by transfer into GS3 rotor bottles in a Sorval GS3 rotor at 5 000 rpm for 5 minutes the supernatant discarded and then resuspended into sterile water and centrifuged again in 50 ml falcon tubes at 3 500 rpm in a Beckman GS 6KR centrifuge. The supernatant was discarded and the cells were subsequently washed with LiAc TE 10 ml 10 mM Tris HCl 1 mM EDTA pH 7.5 100 mM LiOOCCH and resuspended into LiAc TE 2.5 ml .

Transformation took place by mixing the prepared cells 100 l with freshly denatured single stranded salmon testes DNA Lofstrand Labs Gaithersburg Md. and transforming DNA 1 g vol. 

Alternatively instead of multiple small reactions the transformation was performed using a single large scale reaction wherein reagent amounts were scaled up accordingly.

The selective media used was a synthetic complete dextrose agar lacking uracil SCD Ura prepared as described in Kaiser et al. Cold Spring Harbor Press Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. p. 208 210 1994 . Transformants were grown at 30 C. for 2 3 days.

The detection of colonies secreting amylase was performed by including red starch in the selective growth media. Starch was coupled to the red dye Reactive Red 120 Sigma as per the procedure described by Biely et al. 172 176 179 1988 . The coupled starch was incorporated into the SCD Ura agar plates at a final concentration of 0.15 w v and was buffered with potassium phosphate to a pH of 7.0 50 100 mM final concentration .

The positive colonies were picked and streaked across fresh selective media onto 150 mm plates in order to obtain well isolated and identifiable single colonies. Well isolated single colonies positive for amylase secretion were detected by direct incorporation of red starch into buffered SCD Ura agar. Positive colonies were determined by their ability to break down starch resulting in a clear halo around the positive colony visualized directly.

When a positive colony was isolated a portion of it was picked by a toothpick and diluted into sterile water 30 l in a 96 well plate. At this time the positive colonies were either frozen and stored for subsequent analysis or immediately amplified. An aliquot of cells 5 l was used as a template for the PCR reaction in a 25 l volume containing 0.5 l Klentaq Clontech Palo Alto Calif. 4.0 l 10 mM dNTP s Perkin Elmer Cetus 2.5 l Kentaq buffer Clontech 0.25 l forward oligo 1 0.25 l reverse oligo 2 12.5 l distilled water. The sequence of the forward oligonucleotide 1 was 

The underlined regions of the oligonucleotides annealed to the ADH promoter region and the amylase region respectively and amplified a 307 bp region from vector pSST AMY.0 when no insert was present. Typically the first 18 nucleotides of the 5 end of these oligonucleotides contained annealing sites for the sequencing primers. Thus the total product of the PCR reaction from an empty vector was 343 bp. However signal sequence fused cDNA resulted in considerably longer nucleotide sequences.

Following the PCR an aliquot of the reaction 5 l was examined by agarose gel electrophoresis in a 1 agarose gel using a Tris Borate EDTA TBE buffering system as described by Sambrook et al. supra. Clones resulting in a single strong PCR product larger than 400 bp were further analyzed by DNA sequencing after purification with a 96 Qiaquick PCR clean up column Qiagen Inc. Chatsworth Calif. .

A cDNA sequence was isolated in the above screen and compared to a variety of expressed sequence tag EST databases which included public EST databases e.g. GenBank Merck Wash. U. And a proprietary EST DNA database LIFESEQ Incyte Pharmaceuticals Palo Alto Calif. to identify existing homologies. The homology search was performed using the computer program BLAST or BLAST2 Altshul et al. 266 460 480 1996 . Those comparisons resulting in a BLAST score of 70 or in some cases 90 or greater that did not encode known proteins were clustered and assembled into consensus DNA sequences with the program phrap Phil Green University of Washington Seattle Wash. . The consensus sequence obtained is herein designated DNA76621 .

Based on the DNA76621 sequence oligonucleotide probes were generated and used to screen a human testis library prepared as described in paragraph 1 above. The cloning vector was pRK5B pRK5B is a precursors of pRK5D that does not contain the SfiI site see Holmes et al. 253 1278 1280 1991 and the cDNA size cut was less than 2800 bp.

In order to screen several libraries for a full length clone DNA from the libraries was screened by PCR amplification with the PCR primer pair identified above. A positive library was then used to isolate clones encoding the PRO1885 gene using the probe oligonucleotide and one of the PCR primers.

A full length clone was identified designated DNA79302 2521 that contained a single open reading frame with an apparent translational initiation site at nucleotide positions 40 42 and a stop signal at nucleotide positions 1705 1707 SEQ ID NO 19 .

Clone DNA79302 2521 UNQ868 has been deposited with the ATCC and is assigned ATCC deposit no. 203545 on Dec. 22 1998.

An analysis of the Dayhoff database version 35.45 Swiss Prot 35 using a WU BLAST2 sequence alignment analysis of the full length sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 20 evidenced sequence identity between the PRO1885 amino acid sequence and the following Dayhoff sequences A315671 P R10426 ACE HUMAN P R04111 A009141 ACE DROME P R70013 S813611 S57157 and P R65207.

To investigate the role of PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides disruptions in PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 genes were produced by homologous recombination. Specifically transgenic mice comprising disruptions in PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 genes i.e. knockout mice were created by either gene targeting or gene trapping. Mutations were confirmed by southern blot analysis to confirm correct targeting on both the 5 and 3 ends. Gene specific genotyping was also performed by genomic PCR to confirm the loss of the endogenous native transcript as demonstrated by RT PCR using primers that anneal to exons flanking the site of insertion. Targeting vectors were electroporated into 129 strain ES cells and targeted clones were identified. Targeted clones were microinjected into host blastocysts to produce chimeras. Chimeras were bred with C57 animals to produce F1 heterozygotes. Heterozygotes were intercrossed to produce F2 wildtype heterozygote and homozygote cohorts which were used for phenotypic analysis. Rarely if not enough F1 heterozygotes were produced the F1 hets were bred to wildtype C57 mice to produce sufficient heterozygotes to breed for cohorts to be analyzed for a phenotype. All phenotypic analysis was performed from 12 16 weeks after birth.

In these knockout experiments the gene encoding PRO227 polypeptides designated as DNA33786 1132 UNQ201 was disrupted. The gene specific information for these studies is as follows the mutated mouse gene corresponds to nucleotide reference NM181074 or RIKEN cDNA 4930471K13 gene 4930471K13Rik protein reference NP851419 or RIKEN cDNA 4930471K13 the human gene sequence reference BC011057 or hypothetical protein FLJ14594 cDNA clone MGC 17422 IMAGE 4214343 the human protein sequence corresponds to reference AAH11057 or hypothetical protein FLJ14594. Mutation Specific Information corresponds to Homologous Recombination standard wherein Exon 2 was targeted NM181074 .

The targeted mouse gene is represented by NCBI accession NM181074 which is an ortholog of human hypothetical protein FLJ14594. FLJ14594 has features consistent with a type I plasma membrane protein contains leucine rich repeats an immunoglobulin Ig like domain a transmembrane segment and possibly a short cytoplasmic C terminus. The hypothetical protein belongs to a gene family comprised of three members all having no known function EnsEMBL protein family ENSF00000002632 .

Both leucine rich repeats and Ig like domains are usually involved in protein protein interactions and found in a wide variety of proteins Pfam PF00560 and PF00047 . The domain organization and predicted cell location plasma membrane of this hypothetical protein suggests that it may function as a cell adhesion molecule receptor or ligand.

Targeted or gene trap mutations were generated in strain 129SvEv derived embryonic stem ES cells. The chimeric mice were bred to C57BL 6J albino mice to generate F1 heterozygous animals. These progeny were intercrossed to generate F2 wild type heterozygous and homozygous mutant progeny. On rare occasions for example when very few F1 mice were obtained from the chimera F1 heterozygous mice were crossed to 129SvEv C57 hybrid mice to yield additional heterozygous animals for the intercross to generate the F2 mice.

Mutation of the gene encoding the ortholog of human hypothetical protein FLJ14594 FLJ14594 resulted in growth retardation in mice. The homozygous mutant mice were smaller than their wild type littermates exhibiting decreased mean body length total tissue mass and lean body mass. The mice also exhibited a decreased bone mineral related measurements. Both serum cholesterol and triglycerides were elevated in mutant mice. Gene disruption was confirmed by Southern blot.

In the area of bone metabolism targets were identified herein for the treatment of arthritis osteoporosis osteopenia and osteopetrosis as well as identifying targets that promote bone healing. Tests included 

MicroCT for very high resolution and very high sensitivity measurements of bone mineral density for both trabecular and cortical bone.

Procedure A cohort of 4 wild type 4 heterozygotes and 8 homozygotes were tested in this assay. Dual Energy X ray Absorptiometry DEXA has been used successfully to identify changes in bone. Anesthetized animals were examined and bone mineral content BMC BMC LBM ratios volumetric bone mineral density vBMD total body BMD femur BMD and vertebra BMD were measured.

The mouse was anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of Avertin 1.25 2 2 2 tribromoethanol 20 ml kg body weight body length and weight were measured and then the mouse was placed in a prone position on the platform of the PIXImus Densitometer Lunar Inc. for a DEXA scan. Using Lunar PIXImus software the bone mineral density BMD and fat composition fat and total tissue mass TTM were determined in the regions of interest ROI i.e. whole body vertebrae and both femurs .

DEXA Results Both the male and female mice exhibited decreased mean total tissue mass and lean body mass when compared with their gender matched littermates and the historical means. These mutant mice also exhibited decreased mean bone mineral content and bone mineral density in total body femur and vertebrae.

Procedure MicroCT was also used to get very sensitive measurements of BMD. One vertebra and 1 femur were taken from a cohort of 4 wild type and 8 homozygous mice. Measurements were taken of lumbar 5 veterbra traebecular bone volume traebecular thickness connectivity density and midshaft femur total bone area and cortical thickness. The CT40 scans provided detailed information on bone mass and architecture. Multiple bones were placed into sample holders and scanned automatically. Instrument software was used to select regions of interest for analysis. Trabecular bone parameters were analyzed in the fifth lumbar vertebrae LV5 at 16 micrometer resolution and cortical bone parameters were analyzed in the femur midshaft at a resolution of 20 micrometers.

Micro CT Analysis Results The male mice exhibited decreased mean vertebral trabecular bone volume thickness and connectivity density when compared with their gender matched littermates and the historical means. These mutants also exhibited decreased mean femoral mid shaft cortical thickness and cross sectional area.

Body Measurements A measurement of length was performed at approximately 16 weeks of age. The mice exhibited a decreased weight gain and decreased mean body length decreased total tissue mass and decreased lean body mass when compared with their gender matched littermates and the historical mean.

These results demonstrate that knockout mutant male mice deficient in the gene encoding PRO227 polypeptides exhibit growth retardation as well as abnormal bone metabolism with significant bone loss characterized by a decrease in bone mass with decreased density and possibly fragility leading to bone fractures. In addition to the observed bone metabolism abnormalities these studies indicated that mutant mice also showed signs of growth retardation. The bony changes may be a result of the decreased body size and mass of these mice as suggested by the fact that the gene is not expressed in the bone. Such growth disorders are associated with the phenotype or physiological condition associated with tissue wasting diseases such as diabetes or cachexia. Thus PRO227 polypeptides or agonists thereof would be useful for treating diabetes or cachexia.

No hypercalcemia or hyperglycemia was detected in blood chemistry tests to suggest renal parathyroid or adrenal dysfunction that might be related to the decrease in bone mineral density seen on the Dexa scan. However the and mice showed more wide variation in their alkaline phosphatase levels. Although the PRO227 encoding gene is not expressed in the bone the secondary affects caused by growth retardation suggests that PRO227 would be important for maintaining bone homeostasis and bone healing or would be useful for the treatment of arthritis or osteoporosis whereas antagonists to PRO227 or its encoding gene would lead to abnormal or pathological bone disorders including inflammatory diseases associated with abnormal bone metabolism such as arthritis.

In the area of cardiovascular biology targets were identified herein for the treatment of hypertension atherosclerosis heart failure stroke various coronary artery diseases dyslipidemias such as high cholesterol hypercholesterolemia and elevated serum triglycerides hypertriglyceridemia diabetes cancer and or obesity.

The phenotypic tests in this instance included the measurement of serum cholesterol and triglycerides

A cohort of 4 wild type 4 heterozygotes and 8 homozygotes were tested in this assay. High cholesterol and elevated triglyceride levels are recognized risk factors in the development of cardiovascular disease. Measuring blood lipids allowed finding of the biological switches that regulate blood lipid levels and that upon inhibition would lead to a reduction in the risk for cardiovascular disease. Cholesterol measurements were recorded. The COBAS Integra 400 mfr Roche was used for running blood chemistry tests on mice.

Both heterozygous and homozygous mutant mice exhibited an increased mean serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels when compared with their gender matched littermates and the historical mean. Analyzed wt het hom 4 4 8 

Thus mutant mice deficient in the PRO227 gene can serve as a model for cardiovascular disease. PRO227 or its encoding gene would be useful in regulating blood lipids and in particular maintaining normal cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Thus PRO227 polypeptides would be useful in the treatment of such cardiovascular diseases as hypertension atherosclerosis heart failure stroke various coronary artery diseases and or diabetes.

In these knockout experiments the gene encoding PRO233 polypeptides designated as DNA34436 1238 UNQ207 was disrupted.

RETSDR2 converts 5 alpha androstane 3 alpha 17 beta diol a metabolite of dihydrostestosterone into androsterone such activity being first documented in lung Brereton et al. 171 1 2 111 7 2001 though expression of the gene is reported in other tissues. Overall RETSDR2 is well expressed in cells involved with steroidogeneisis and the enzyme is proposed to have an important role in androgen metabolism Li et al. 24 3 4 663 7 1998 Chai et al. 144 5 2084 91 2003 .

Targeted or gene trap mutations were generated in strain 129SvEv derived embryonic stem ES cells. The wild type expression panel resulted in the following observation expression of the target gene was detected in embryonic stem ES cells and among the 13 adult tissue samples tested by RT PCR in bone skin fibroblast adipose and tail. Disruption of the target gene was confirmed by Southern hybridization analysis. The chimeric mice were bred to C57BL 6J albino mice to generate F1 heterozygous animals. These progeny were intercrossed to generate F2 wild type heterozygous and homozygous mutant progeny. On rare occasions for example when very few F1 mice were obtained from the chimera F1 heterozygous mice were crossed to 129SvEv C57 hybrid mice to yield additional heterozygous animals for the intercross to generate the F2 mice.

The wild type expression panel showed that the expression of the gene was detected in embryonic stem ES cells and among the 13 adult tissue samples tested by RT PCR in brain spinal cord thymus bone and adipose. RT PCR analysis revealed that the transcript was absent in the mouse analyzed.

Mutation of the gene encoding the ortholog of human retinal short chain dehydrogenase reductase 2 RETSDR2 resulted in a 2 fold increased percentage of immature B cells in bone marrow. In addition mice exhibited consistent alterations in bone marrow but no effects were seen in thymus or spleen. Lymph node FACS showed trends in increased cell number for certain cell types. RT PCR analyses revealed that the transcript was absent in the homozygous mutant mice.

Immune related and inflammatory diseases are the manifestation or consequence of fairly complex often multiple interconnected biological pathways which in normal physiology are critical to respond to insult or injury initiate repair from insult or injury and mount innate and acquired defense against foreign organisms. Disease or pathology occurs when these normal physiological pathways cause additional insult or injury either as directly related to the intensity of the response as a consequence of abnormal regulation or excessive stimulation as a reaction to self or as a combination of these.

Though the genesis of these diseases often involves multistep pathways and often multiple different biological systems pathways intervention at critical points in one or more of these pathways can have an ameliorative or therapeutic effect. Therapeutic intervention can occur by either antagonism of a detrimental process pathway or stimulation of a beneficial process pathway.

T lymphocytes T cells are an important component of a mammalian immune response. T cells recognize antigens which are associated with a self molecule encoded by genes within the major histocompatibility complex MHC . The antigen may be displayed together with MHC molecules on the surface of antigen presenting cells virus infected cells cancer cells grafts etc. The T cell system eliminates these altered cells which pose a health threat to the host mammal T cells include helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells. Helper T cells proliferate extensively following recognition of an antigen MHC complex on an antigen presenting cell. Helper T cells also secrete a variety of cytokines i.e. lymphokines which play a central role in the activation of B cells cytotoxic T cells and a variety of other cells which participate in the immune response.

In many immune responses inflammatory cells infiltrate the site of injury or infection. The migrating cells may be neutrophilic eosinophilic monocytic or lymphocytic as can be determined by histologic examination of the affected tissues. Current Protocols in Immunology ed. John E. Coligan 1994 John Wiley Sons Inc.

Many immune related diseases are known and have been extensively studied. Such diseases include immune mediated inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis immune mediated renal disease hepatobiliary diseases inflammatory bowel disease IBD psoriasis and asthma non immune mediated inflammatory diseases infectious diseases immunodeficiency diseases neoplasia and graft rejection etc. In the area of immunology targets were identified for the treatment of inflammation and inflammatory disorders.

In the area of immunology targets have been identified herein for the treatment of inflammation and inflammatory disorders. Immune related diseases in one instance could be treated by suppressing the immune response. Using neutralizing antibodies that inhibit molecules having immune stimulatory activity would be beneficial in the treatment of immune mediated and inflammatory diseases. Molecules which inhibit the immune response can be utilized proteins directly or via the use of antibody agonists to inhibit the immune response and thus ameliorate immune related disease.

Procedure FACS analysis of immune cell composition from peripheral blood was performed including analysis of CD4 CD8 and T cell receptors to evaluate T lymphocytes CD19 for B lymphocytes CD45 as a leukocyte marker and pan NK for natural killer cells. The FACS analysis was carried out on 2 wild type and 6 homozygous mice and included cells derived from thymus spleen bone marrow and lymph node.

In these studies analyzed cells were isolated from thymus peripheral blood spleen bone marrow and lymph nodes. Flow cytometry was designed to determine the relative proportions of CD4 and CD8 positive T cells B cells NK cells and monocytes in the mononuclear cell population. A Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur 3 laser FACS machine was used to assess immune status. For Phenotypic Assays and Screening this machine records CD4 CD8 CD8 CD4 NK B cell and monocyte numbers in addition to the CD4 CD8 ratio.

The mononuclear cell profile was derived by staining a single sample of lysed peripheral blood from each mouse with a panel of six lineage specific antibodies CD45 PerCP anti TCRb APC CD4 PE CD8 FITC pan NK PE and CD19 FITC. The two FITC and PE labeled antibodies stain mutually exclusive cell types. The samples were analyzed using a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer with CellQuest software.

Results Tissue specific FACS analysis gave the following results The mice exhibited a 2 fold increase percentage of immature B cells in bone marrow when compared with their littermates and the historical mean. Lymph node FACS analysis showed increased cell number for certain cell types TcR cells CD19 cells and GR1 cells .

In summary tissue specific FACS analysis indicate that knockout mice deficient in the gene encoding PRO233 polypeptides exhibit immunological abnormalities when compared with their wild type littermates. The mutant mice exhibited an abnormal immune cell composition and tissue specific FACS analysis suggesting that inhibitors or antagonists to PRO233 polypeptides would stimulate the immune system such as T cell proliferation and would find utility in the cases wherein this effect would be beneficial to the individual such as in the case of leukemia and other types of cancer and in immunocompromised patients such as AIDS sufferers. Accordingly PRO233 polypeptides or agonists thereof would inhibit the immune response and would be useful candidates for suppressing harmful immune responses e.g. in the case of graft rejection or graft versus host diseases.

In these knockout experiments the gene encoding PRO238 polypeptides designated as DNA35600 1162 UNQ212 was disrupted. The gene specific information for these studies is as follows the mutated mouse gene corresponds to nucleotide reference NM145428 or similar to DKFZP566O084 protein LOC216820 protein reference NP663403 or similar to DKFZP566O084 protein the human gene sequence reference NM015510 or DKFZP566O084 protein gene the human protein sequence corresponds to reference NP056325 or DKFZP566O084 protein. Mutation Specific Information corresponds to retroviral insertion OST . Retroviral insertion disrupted the gene prior to the exon encoding amino acid 18 in a protein of 323 amino acids NCBI accession number NP663403 .

The gene of interest is represented by NCBI accession NM145428 ortholog of human DKFZP566O084 protein. Aliases include cDNA sequence BC003479 LOC216820 CGI 93 and MGC8916.

DKFZp566O084 is a hypothetical protein containing a short chain dehydrogenase domain Pfam PF00106 . Typically such proteins are NAD or NADP dependent oxidoreductases. A signal peptide is predicted at the N terminus and ProtComp Softberry Inc. Mount Kisco N.Y. software analysis indicates the protein may be targeted to the mitochondrion.

Targeted or gene trap mutations were generated in strain 129SvEv derived embryonic stem ES cells. The chimeric mice were bred to C57BL 6J albino mice to generate F1 heterozygous animals. These progeny were intercrossed to generate F2 wild type heterozygous and homozygous mutant progeny. On rare occasions for example when very few F1 mice were obtained from the chimera F1 heterozygous mice were crossed to 129SvEv C57 hybrid mice to yield additional heterozygous animals for the intercross to generate the F2 mice.

In the wild type animals expression of the target gene was detected in embryonic stem ES cells and in all 19 adult tissue samples tested by RT PCR except asthmatic lung skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Genetic data indicate that this retroviral insertion resulted in lethality of the homozygous mutants. Due to lethality transcript expression analysis was not performed. It is not clear when lethality occurs but by three weeks of age all of the mutant mice were dead.

Embryonic lethality in knockout mice usually results from various serious developmental problems including but not limited to neurodegenerative diseases angiogenic disorders inflammatory diseases or where the gene protein has an important role in basic cell signaling processes in many cell types. In addition embryonic lethals are useful as potential cancer models. Likewise the corresponding heterozygous mutant animals are particularly useful when they exhibit a phenotype and or a pathology report which reveals highly informative clues as to the function of the knocked out gene. For instance EPO knockout animals were embryonic lethals but the pathology reports on the embryos showed a profound lack of RBCs. In the instant example PRO238 mutant mice showed serious and multiple physiological abnormalities involving the gastrointestinal tract GI hematopoietic respiratory neuromuscular and reproductive systems.

Multiple histological defects were observed in KO mice involving GI hematopoietic respiratory neuromuscular and reproductive systems. Necropsy revealed that the 13 day old homozygous mutants exhibited numerous lesions including megaesophagus and hypoplasia of the glandular stomach. Three fourths of the mice exhibited thymic atrophy lymphoid depletion and muscle degeneration. Exophthalmus was present in most homozygotes. Homozygous mutant mice resulted in embryonic lethality by three weeks of age. Thus PRO238 polypeptides or the gene encoding PRO238 must be essential for embryonic development.

Necropsy revealed that the 13 day old homozygous mutants exhibited numerous lesions including megaesophagus and hypoplasia of the glandular stomach. Three fourths of the mice exhibited thymic atrophy lymphoid depletion and muscle degeneration. Exophthalmus was present in most homozygotes. In the GI tract esophageal dilatation with multifocal hyperkeratosis as well as gastric hypoplasia was observed with significantly reduced parietal cells and chief cells. These KO mice appeared to be stressed with thymic atrophy necrosis and or splenic lymphoid depletion. Increased hematopoiesis was also noted in bone marrow liver spleen and thymus. Aspiration pneumonia was found in several mice which may be related to esophageal dysfunction. Other findings included seminiferous tubule necrosis multifocal vacuolation in brain focal muscular degeneration and diffuse degeneration in the Harderia gland. All the mice died by three weeks of age.

As summarized above embryonic lethality in knockout mice usually results from various serious developmental problems including but not limited to neurodegenerative diseases angiogenic disorders inflammatory diseases or where the gene protein has an important role in basic cell signaling processes in many cell types. In addition embryonic lethals are useful as potential cancer models. In the instant example it is likely that antagonists to PRO238 or its encoding gene results in serious disorders of the gastrointestinal tract and could lead to such disorders as stomach or esophageal cancer. Likewise PRO238 or agonists would be useful in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders including cancer.

In these knockout experiments the gene encoding PRO1328 polypeptides designated as DNA66658 1584 UNQ688 was disrupted. The gene specific information for these studies is as follows the mutated mouse gene corresponds to nucleotide reference NM026674 or RIKEN cDNA 0610008A10 gene 0610008A10Rik protein reference BAB22004 the human gene sequence reference NM031301 or which is likely the ortholog of anterior pharynx defective 1B APH 1B protein reference AAH20905 or hypothetical protein DKFZp564D0372 . Mutation Specific Information corresponds to homologous recombination conditional codon 2 was targeted .

The mouse gene targeted is represented by RIKEN cDNA 0610008A10 which is orthologous to human anterior pharynx defective 1B like PSFL . Aliases include presenilin stabilization factor like and APH 1B. PSFL consists of a signal peptide sequence and six or seven transmembrane spanning segments. The protein is predicted to be located at the plasma membrane as determined by ProtComp analysis Softberry Inc. Mount Kisco N.Y. 2003 .

PSFL interacts with presenilin enhancer 2 nicastrin and presenilin. PSFL is required for the activity and accumulation of gamma secretase which is involved in Notch and beta amyloid precursor protein signaling. Notch is involved in developmental cell fate and beta amyloid precursor protein is involved in gene expression and Alzheimer s disease.

Wild type expression of the target gene was detected in embryonic stem ES cells and in all 13 adult tissue samples tested by RT PCR except tail. Disruption of the target gene was confirmed by Southern hybridization analysis.

The male and female mice exhibited increased mean serum cholesterol levels when compared with their gender matched littermates and the historical means. In addition abnormalities in the urinalysis was observed in the homozygous mice.

In the area of cardiovascular biology targets were identified herein for the treatment of hypertension atherosclerosis heart failure stroke various coronary artery diseases dyslipidemias such as high cholesterol hypercholesterolemia and elevated serum triglycerides hypertriglyceridemia cancer and or obesity.

A cohort of 4 wild type 4 heterozygotes and 8 homozygotes were tested in this assay. High cholesterol levels are recognized risk factors in the development of cardiovascular disease. Measuring blood lipids allowed finding of the biological switches that regulate blood lipid levels and that upon inhibition would lead to a reduction in the risk for cardiovascular disease. Cholesterol measurements were recorded. The COBAS Integra 400 mfr Roche was used for running blood chemistry tests on mice.

As summarized above the mice exhibited an increased mean serum cholesterol level compared to normal levels when compared with their gender matched littermates and the historical mean. No change in triglycerides was observed. Analyzed Wt Het Hom 4 4 8 

Thus mutant mice deficient in the PRO1328 can serve as a model for cardiovascular disease. PRO1328 or its encoding gene would be useful for regulating blood lipids and in particular maintaining normal cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Thus PRO1328 polypeptides would be useful in the treatment of such cardiovascular diseases as hypertension atherosclerosis heart failure stroke various coronary artery diseases and or obesity or diabetes.

The routine urinalysis is a screening test done to provide a general evaluation of the renal urinary system. The characteristics for which urine is routinely examined includes tests for protein glucose ketones blood bilirubin urobilinogen nitrate and leukocyte esterase as well as pH and specific gravity. The histograms show 9 measurements grouped by genotype Leukocyte nitrate protein glucose osmolality ketone urobilinogen bilirubin blood.

The mutant mice showed abnormalities in the urinalysis as described above. Elevated levels of urobilinogen ketones and blood were observed. The presence of ketones in the urine is indicative of an abnormal lipid metabolism or dyslipidemia which may be an early sign of the onset of diabetes.

In these knockout experiments the gene encoding PRO4342 polypeptides designated as DNA96787 2534 1 UNQ1896 was disrupted. The gene specific information for these studies is as follows the mutated mouse gene corresponds to nucleotide reference NM019451 or interleukin 1 family member 5 delta Il1f5 protein reference NP062324 or interleukin 1 family member 5 interleukin 1 receptor antagonist homolog 1 the human gene sequence reference NM012275 or interleukin 1 family member 5 delta IL1F5 transcript variant 1 protein reference NP036407 or interleukin 1 family member 5 interleukin 1 receptor antagonist homolog 1 interleukin 1 delta interleukin 1 like protein 1 family of interleukin 1 delta interleukin 1 HY1 IL 1ra homolog IL 1 related protein 3 . Mutation Specific Information corresponds to homologous recombination standard exons 3 4 and 5 were targeted AK014576 .

The disrupted mouse gene is an interleukin 1 family member 5 delta Il1f5 ortholog of human interleukin 1 family member 5 delta IL1F5 . Aliases include IL 1H3 IL1HY1 FIL1delta interleukin 1 receptor antagonist homolog 1 FIL1 FIL1D IL1L1 IL1RP3 MGC29840 IL 1ra homolog interleukin 1 HY1 IL 1 related protein 3 interleukin 1 like protein 1 family of interleukin 1 delta and interleukin 1 receptor antagonist homolog 1.

IL1F5 a member of the interleukin 1 cytokine family specifically inhibits activation of nuclear factor kappaB by IL1F6 interleukin 1 family member 6 epsilon Debets et al. 167 3 1440 6 2001 . However IL1F5 does not have antagonist activities associated with its close paralog IL1RN interleukin 1 receptor antagonist Barton et al. 30 11 3299 308 2000 . Allelic variation in IL1F5 has been suggested as a predisposing factor in some forms of severe alopecia areata Tazi Ahnini et al. 29 1 25 30 2002 . By similarity with other members of the interleukin 1 family an extracellular location is inferred.

Targeted or gene trap mutations were generated in strain 129SvEv derived embryonic stem ES cells. The chimeric mice were bred to C57BL 6J albino mice to generate F1 heterozygous animals. These progeny were intercrossed to generate F2 wild type heterozygous and homozygous mutant progeny. On rare occasions for example when very few F1 mice were obtained from the chimera F1 heterozygous mice were crossed to 129SvEv C57 hybrid mice to yield additional heterozygous animals for the intercross to generate the F2 mice. Level I phenotypic analysis was performed on mice from this generation as described below.

Wild type expression of the target gene was detected in embryonic stem ES cells and in all 13 adult samples tested by RT PCR except lung liver skeletal muscle bone and heart. Disruption of the target gene was confirmed by Southern hybridization analysis.

The female mice exhibited increased activity during home cage activity testing when compared with their wild type littermates and the historical means. Whiskers were absent on most homozygotes with bald patches on the snouts. There was moderate degeneration of the seminiferous tubules in the male mice examined.

In the area of neurology analysis focused herein on identifying in vivo validated targets for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders including depression generalized anxiety disorders attention deficit hyperactivity disorder obsessive compulsive disorder schizophrenia cognitive disorders hyperalgesia and sensory disorders. Neurological disorders include include but are not limited to depression generalized anxiety disorders attention deficit disorder sleep disorder hyperactivity disorder obsessive compulsive disorder schizophrenia cognitive disorders hyperalgesia and sensory disorders mild to moderate anxiety anxiety disorder due to a general medical condition anxiety disorder not otherwise specified generalized anxiety disorder panic attack panic disorder with agoraphobia panic disorder without agoraphobia posttraumatic stress disorder social phobia social anxiety autism specific phobia substance induced anxiety disorder acute alcohol withdrawal obsessive compulsive disorder agoraphobia monopolar disorders bipolar disorder I or II bipolar disorder not otherwise specified cyclothymic disorder depressive disorder major depressive disorder mood disorder substance induced mood disorder enhancement of cognitive function loss of cognitive function associated with but not limited to Alzheimer s disease stroke or traumatic injury to the brain seizures resulting from disease or injury including but not limited to epilepsy learning disorders disabilities cerebral palsy. In addition anxiety disorders may apply to personality disorders including but not limited to the following types paranoid antisocial avoidant behavior borderline personality disorders dependent histronic narcissistic obsessive compulsive schizoid and schizotypal.

Behavioral screens were performed on a cohort of 4 wild type 4 heterozygous and 8 homozygous mutant mice. All behavioral tests were done between 12 and 16 weeks of age unless reduced viability necessitates earlier testing. These tests included measurements of circadian rhythms as well as a functional observational battery FOB to measure anxiety or activity levels.

Female mice are individually housed at 4 pm on the first day of testing in 48.2 cm 26.5 cm home cages and administered food and water ad libitum. Animals are exposed to a 12 hour light dark cycle with lights turning on at 7 am and turning off at 7 pm. The system software records the number of beam interruptions caused by the animal s movements with beam breaks automatically divided into ambulations. Activity is recorded in 60 one hour intervals during the three day test. Data generated are displayed by median activity levels recorded for each hour circadian rhythm and median total activity during each light dark cycle locomotor activity over the three day testing period.

The female mice exhibited increased ambulatory counts during the 12 hour habituation and both dark phases when compared with their gender matched littermates and the historical means. These results are indicative of increased anxiety of the mutant mice.

Test Description The FOB is a series of situations applied to the animal to determine gross sensory and motor deficits. A subset of tests from the Irwin neurological screen that evaluates gross neurological function is used. In general short duration tactile olfactory and visual stimuli are applied to the animal to determine their ability to detect and respond normally. These simple tests take approximately 10 minutes and the mouse is returned to its home cage at the end of testing.

Whiskers were absent on most homozygotes with bald patches on the snout. This finding is indicative of an increased anxiety level of the mutant mice. In addition the negative phenotype of alopecia baldness was observed. Thus antagonists to PRO4342 would be a causative factor for alopecia baldness . In this regard PRO4342 or agonists would be useful in the treatment of balding or premature hair loss.

In summary both the circadian rhythm testing and functional observational battery tests indicated an increased anxiety behavior pattern for the mice. Thus knockout mice demonstrated a phenotype consistent with anxiety disorders which include but are not limited to mild to moderate anxiety generalized anxiety disorder panic attack panic disorder with agoraphobia panic disorder without agoraphobia obsessive compulsive disorder agoraphobia bipolar disorder I or II or cyclothymic disorder. In view of these findings PRO4342 or agonists thereof would be useful for treating such neurological anxiety disorders.

Microscopic observations on the two male mice examined exhibited a moderate degeneration of the seminiferous tubules. This negative phenotype suggests that antagonists to PRO4342 may lead to reproductive disorders. In contrast PRO4342 or agonists thereof would be useful in the prevention or treatment of such reproductive disorders.

Procedure A cohort of 1 wild type and 2 homozygous mutants were used in this assay. Peritoneal leukocyte recruitment assays were used to identify targets that may regulate the inflammatory component of atherosclerosis. These assays detect abnormalities in immune cell recruitment to a site of inflammation. Zymosan an agent which induces inflammation was injected into the intraperitoneal cavity and fluid was later removed and measurements were taken of total WBC counts neutrophil monocyte ratio and percent granulocytes monocytes lymphocytes and eosinophils in the ip fluid.

Results The mice exhibited a notably increased total white blood cell count after zymosan challenge when compared with their littermate and the historical range suggestive of an increased response to an inflammatory stimulus in these mutants.

In summary the zymosan challenge studies indicate that knockout mice deficient in the gene encoding PRO7423 polypeptides exhibit a proinflammatory response when compared with their wild type littermates. Thus antagonists of PRO7423 polypeptides would stimulate the immune system such as T cell proliferation and would find utility in the cases wherein this effect would be beneficial to the individual such as in the case of leukemia and other types of cancer and in immunocompromised patients such as AIDS sufferers. Accordingly PRO7423 polypeptides or agonists thereto would inhibit the immune response and would be useful candidates for suppressing harmful immune responses e.g. in the case of graft rejection or graft versus host diseases.

In these knockout experiments the gene encoding PRO10096 polypeptides designated as DNA125185 2806 UNQ3099 was disrupted. The gene specific information for these studies is as follows the mutated mouse gene corresponds to nucleotide reference NM016971 or interleukin 22 Il122 protein reference NP058667 or interleukin 22 interleukin 10 related T cell derived inducible factor the human gene sequence reference NM020525 or interleukin 22 IL22 protein reference NP065386 or IL 10 related T cell derived inducible factor interleukin 21 . Mutation type corresponds to Homologous Recombination conditional . Coding exons 1 through 4 were targeted NM016971 .

The gene of interest is interleukin 22 IL22 ortholog of human IL22. Aliases include IL 22 ILtif IL TIF interleukin 10 related T cell derived inducible factor interleukin 21 IL21 TIFa IL 21 ILTIF IL IL D110 zcytol8 and TIFIL 23.

IL22 a homolog of IL 10 is a cytokine that binds to and signals through the class II cytokine receptor heterodimer IL 22RA1 CRF2 4 Xu et al 98 17 9511 6 2001 . IL22 triggers all three major mitogen activated protein kinase pathways Lejeune et al 277 37 33676 82 2002 activating signal transducer and activator of transcription STAT 1 STAT3 and STAT5 Xie et al 275 40 31335 9 2000 .

T cells and mast cells produce IL22 to induce acute phase reactants in other tissues suggesting IL22 is involved in inflammation Xu et al 2001 supra . Moreover IL22 modulates IL 4 production from Th2T cells Xie et al 2000 supra . The cytokine receptor IL22RA2 is a naturally occurring antagonist of IL22 and may be an important regulator of IL22 in the immune response Xu et al 2001 supra . The interleukin 10 family of cytokines have been the subject of several reviews Wolk et al. 168 11 5397 402 2002 Kotenko S. V. 13 3 223 40 2003 Conti et al. 88 3 171 4 2003 and a crystal structure has been proposed for IL22 Nagem et al. 10 8 1051 62 2002 .

Interpreting the literature is done with caution because two of the aliases encountered for IL22 have been used to refer to other genes IL 21 is an synonym for interleukin 21 LocusLink 50616 and IL 22 is an alias for interleukin 17D LocusLink 53342 .

Current knowledge of IL 22 suggests it can induce a variety of acute phase proteins including serum amyloid A PAP1 osteopontin alpha1 antichymotrypsin and haptoglobin and S100A8 MMP 3 and mucins.

Targeted or gene trap mutations are generated in strain 129SvEv derived embryonic stem ES cells. The chimeric mice are bred to C57BL 6J albino mice to generate F1 heterozygous animals. These progeny are crossed to hybrid 129SvEv C57 Cre homozygous mice to generate mice carrying both the mutant and Cre alleles compound heterozygous mice . The male compound heterozygous mice are then crossed to hybrid 129SvEv C57 F1 mice derived from crossing 129SvEvmice to C57BL 6J mice to generate heterozygous Cre excised animals. Finally these progeny are intercrossed to generate wild type Cre excised heterozygous and Cre excised homozygous mice. Level I phenotypic analysis is performed on mice from this generation.

Mutation of the gene encoding the ortholog of human interleukin 22 IL22 resulted in anxiety related phenotypes and an abnormal exploratory response in mice. Females showed an increased anxiety response in open field testing. The mice also exhibited an increased percentage of CD4 cells and a decreased percentage of B cells in the peripheral blood. Gene disruption was confirmed by Southern blot.

Immune related and inflammatory diseases are the manifestation or consequence of fairly complex often multiple interconnected biological pathways which in normal physiology are critical to respond to insult or injury initiate repair from insult or injury and mount innate and acquired defense against foreign organisms. Disease or pathology occurs when these normal physiological pathways cause additional insult or injury either as directly related to the intensity of the response as a consequence of abnormal regulation or excessive stimulation as a reaction to self or as a combination of these.

Though the genesis of these diseases often involves multistep pathways and often multiple different biological systems pathways intervention at critical points in one or more of these pathways can have an ameliorative or therapeutic effect. Therapeutic intervention can occur by either antagonism of a detrimental process pathway or stimulation of a beneficial process pathway.

T lymphocytes T cells are an important component of a mammalian immune response. T cells recognize antigens which are associated with a self molecule encoded by genes within the major histocompatibility complex MHC . The antigen may be displayed together with MHC molecules on the surface of antigen presenting cells virus infected cells cancer cells grafts etc. The T cell system eliminates these altered cells which pose a health threat to the host mammal T cells include helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells. Helper T cells proliferate extensively following recognition of an antigen MHC complex on an antigen presenting cell. Helper T cells also secrete a variety of cytokines i.e. lymphokines which play a central role in the activation of B cells cytotoxic T cells and a variety of other cells which participate in the immune response.

In many immune responses inflammatory cells infiltrate the site of injury or infection. The migrating cells may be neutrophilic eosinophilic monocytic or lymphocytic as can be determined by histologic examination of the affected tissues. Current Protocols in Immunology ed. John E. Coligan 1994 John Wiley Sons Inc.

Many immune related diseases are known and have been extensively studied. Such diseases include immune mediated inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis immune mediated renal disease hepatobiliary diseases inflammatory bowel disease IBD psoriasis and asthma non immune mediated inflammatory diseases infectious diseases immunodeficiency diseases neoplasia and graft rejection etc.

In the area of immunology targets were identified herein for the treatment of inflammation and inflammatory disorders. Immune related diseases could be treated by suppressing the immune response. Using neutralizing antibodies that inhibit molecules having immune stimulatory activity would be beneficial in the treatment of immune mediated and inflammatory diseases. Molecules which inhibit the immune response can be utilized proteins directly or via the use of antibody agonists to inhibit the immune response and thus ameliorate immune related disease.

FACS analysis of immune cell composition from peripheral blood was performed including CD4 CD8 and T cell receptor to evaluate T lymphocytes CD19 for B lymphocytes CD45 as a leukocyte marker and pan NK for natural killer cells. The FACS analysis was carried out on 6 wild type and 8 homozygous mice and included cells derived from thymus spleen bone marrow and lymph node.

In these studies analyzed cells were isolated from thymus peripheral blood spleen bone marrow and lymph nodes. Flow cytometry was designed to determine the relative proportions of CD4 and CD8 positive T cells B cells NK cells and monocytes in the mononuclear cell population. A Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur 3 laser FACS machine was used to assess immune status. For Phenotypic Assays and Screening this machine records CD4 CD8 CD8 CD4 NK B cell and monocyte numbers in addition to the CD4 CD8 ratio. The mononuclear cell profile was derived by staining a single sample of lysed peripheral blood from each mouse with a panel of six lineage specific antibodies CD45 PerCP anti TCRb APC CD4 PE CD8 FITC pan NK PE and CD19 FITC. The two FITC and PE labeled antibodies stain mutually exclusive cell types. The samples were analyzed using a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer with CellQuest software.

The homozygous mutant mice exhibited an increased mean percentage of CD4 cells and a decreased mean percentage of B cells when compared with their wild type littermates. In summary FACS analysis of immune cell composition from peripheral blood indicates that knockout mice exhibit immunological differences with respect to CD4 cells when compared with their wild type littermates. Thus antagonists of PRO10096 polypeptides or its encoding gene would elicit increased levels of CD4. The co receptor CD4 molecule cooperates with the T cell receptor which differentially recognizes MHC class II molecules in the antigen recognition process.

In the area of neurology analysis focused herein on identifying in vivo validated targets for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders including depression generalized anxiety disorders attention deficit hyperactivity disorder obsessive compulsive disorder schizophrenia cognitive disorders hyperalgesia and sensory disorders. Neurological disorders include include but are not limited to depression generalized anxiety disorders attention deficit disorder sleep disorder hyperactivity disorder obsessive compulsive disorder schizophrenia cognitive disorders hyperalgesia and sensory disorders mild to moderate anxiety anxiety disorder due to a general medical condition anxiety disorder not otherwise specified generalized anxiety disorder panic attack panic disorder with agoraphobia panic disorder without agoraphobia posttraumatic stress disorder social phobia social anxiety autism specific phobia substance induced anxiety disorder acute alcohol withdrawal obsessive compulsive disorder agoraphobia monopolar disorders bipolar disorder I or II bipolar disorder not otherwise specified cyclothymic disorder depressive disorder major depressive disorder mood disorder substance induced mood disorder enhancement of cognitive function loss of cognitive function associated with but not limited to Alzheimer s disease stroke or traumatic injury to the brain seizures resulting from disease or injury including but not limited to epilepsy learning disorders disabilities cerebral palsy. In addition anxiety disorders may apply to personality disorders including but not limited to the following types paranoid antisocial avoidant behavior borderline personality disorders dependent histronic narcissistic obsessive compulsive schizoid and schizotypal.

Behavioral screens were performed on a cohort of 4 wild type 4 heterozygous and 8 homozygous mutant mice. All behavioral tests were done between 12 and 16 weeks of age unless reduced viability necessitates earlier testing. These tests included open field to measure anxiety activity levels and exploration.

Several targets of known drugs have exhibited phenotypes in the open field test. These include knockouts of the serotonin transporter the dopamine transporter Giros et al. Nature. 1996 Feb. 15 379 6566 606 12 and the GABA receptor Homanics et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 1997 Apr. 15 94 8 4143 8 . An automated open field assay was customized to address changes related to affective state and exploratory patterns related to learning. First the field 40 40 cm was selected to be relatively large for a mouse thus designed to pick up changes in locomotor activity associated with exploration. In addition there were 4 holes in the floor to allow for nose poking an activity specifically related to exploration. Several factors were also designed to heighten the affective state associated with this test. The open field test is the first experimental procedure in which the mice are tested and the measurements that were taken were the subjects first experience with the chamber. In addition the open field was brightly lit. All these factors will heighten the natural anxiety associated with novel and open spaces. The pattern and extent of exploratory activity and especially the center to total distance traveled ratio may then be able to discern changes related to susceptibility to anxiety or depression. A large arena 40 cm 40 cm VersaMax animal activity monitoring system from AccuScan Instruments with infrared beams at three different levels was used to record rearing hole poke and locomotor activity. The animal was placed in the center and its activity was measured for 20 minutes. Data from this test was analyzed in five 4 minute intervals. The total distance traveled cm vertical movement number rearing number of hole pokes and the center to total distance ratio were recorded.

The propensity for mice to exhibit normal habituation responses to a novel environment is assessed by determining the overall change in their horizontal locomotor activity across the 5 time intervals. This calculated slope of the change in activity over time is determined using normalized rather than absolute total distance traveled. The slope is determined from the regression line through the normalized activity at each of the 5 time intervals. Normal habituation is represented by a negative slope value.

Results A notable difference was observed during open field activity testing. The female mice exhibited a decreased median sum time in the center area when compared with their gender matched littermates. This type of behavior is consistent with an increased anxiety like response. Knockout mice demonstrated a phenotype consistent with anxiety related disorders which are associated with mild to moderate anxiety anxiety due to a general medical condition and or bipolar disorders hyperactivity sensory disorders obsessive compulsive disorders schizophrenia or a paranoid personality. Thus PRO10096 polypeptides or agonists thereof would be useful in the treatment of such neurological disorders or the amelioration of the symptoms associated with anxiety disorders.

In these knockout experiments the gene encoding PRO21384 polypeptides designated as DNA177313 2982 UNQ6368 was disrupted. The gene specific information for these studies is as follows the mutated mouse gene corresponds to nucleotide reference NM139299 or gp130 like monocyte receptor Glmr pending protein reference NP647460 or gp130 like monocyte receptor cytokine receptor NR10 the human gene sequence reference NM139017 or gp130 like monocyte receptor CRL3 protein reference NP620586 or gp130 like monocyte receptor soluble type I cytokine receptor CRL3 . Mutation type corresponds to Homologous Recombination standard . Coding exon 4 was targeted.

The disrupted mouse gene is Gp130 like monocyte receptor Glmr ortholog of human gp130 like monocyte receptor CRL3 . Aliases include NR10 GLM R cytokine receptor NR10 GLMR and soluble type I cytokine receptor CRL3. CRL3 is a novel type I cytokine receptor with homology to interleukin 6 receptor gp130 and granulocyte colony stimulating factor receptor. CRL3 is expressed on CD14 positive cells activates STAT3 and STAT5 and may be involved in monocyte maturation and development. Bioinformatic analyses indicate the receptor has a signal peptide sequence a large extracellular domain and a cytoplasmic signaling domain.

Targeted or gene trap mutations were generated in strain 129SvEv derived embryonic stem ES cells. The chimeric mice were bred to C57BL 6J albino mice to generate F1 heterozygous animals. These progeny were intercrossed to generate F2 wild type heterozygous and homozygous mutant progeny. On rare occasions for example when very few F1 mice were obtained from the chimera F1 heterozygous mice were crossed to 129SvEv C57 hybrid mice to yield additional heterozygous animals for the intercross to generate the F2 mice. Level I phenotypic analysis was performed on mice from this generation as shown below.

Wild type expression of the target gene was detected all 13 adult tissue samples tested by RT PCR except liver testis small intestine and colon heart and tail. Disruption of the target gene was confirmed by Southern hybridization analysis.

The male homozygous mutant mice exhibited a decreased anxiety like response during open field activity testing when compared with their gender matched wild type littermates and the historical mean. No other notable phenotype was observed for the homozygous mutant mice. Disruption of the target gene was confirmed by Southern hybridization analysis.

Results A notable difference was observed during open field activity testing. The male mice exhibited an increased median sum time in the center area when compared with their gender matched littermates which is indicative of a decreased anxiety like response in the mutants. Thus male knockout mice demonstrated a phenotype consistent with depressive disorders including depression generalized anxiety disorders attention deficit disorder sleep disorder hypoactivity disorder obsessive compulsive disorder schizophrenia cognitive disorders hyperalgesia and or sensory disorders. Thus PRO21384 polypeptides and agonists thereof would be useful in the treatment or amelioration of the symptoms associated with depressive disorders.

In these knockout experiments the gene encoding PRO353 polypeptides designated as DNA41234 1242 1 UNQ310 was disrupted. The gene specific information for these studies is as follows the mutated mouse gene corresponds to nucleotide reference NM019959 or putative secreted protein ZSIG37 Zsig37 protein reference NP064343 or putative secreted protein ZSIG37 the human gene sequence reference AF232905 or putative GPCR interacting protein GIP protein reference AAG44303 or putative GPCR interacting protein GIP . Mutation type corresponds to Homologous Recombination standard . Coding exon 4 was targeted NM019959 .

The gene that is mutated in these animals is represented by mouse UniGene cluster Mm.23845 which is the ortholog of human cluster Hs.201398 C1QTNF1 . C1QTNF1 encodes G protein coupled receptor interacting protein that is complement C1q tumor necrosis factor related. Alternate names include GIP CTRP1 ZSIG37 and FLJ90694.

C1QTNF1 encodes several distinct domains. The N terminus contains two overlapping cysteine rich regions characteristic of the TNFR NGFR motif Receptors in this family include certain tumor necrosis factor receptors and nerve growth factor receptors. The C terminus contains a C1q like domain a globular domain found in many collagens.

Overall the protein has similarities to a variety of soluble collagens that are thought to be involved in defense processes and may be membrane bound or secreted by similarity .

Targeted or gene trap mutations were generated in strain 129SvEv derived embryonic stem ES cells. The chimeric mice were bred to C57BL 6J albino mice to generate F1 heterozygous animals. These progeny were intercrossed to generate F2 wild type heterozygous and homozygous mutant progeny. On rare occasions for example when very few F1 mice were obtained from the chimera F1 heterozygous mice were crossed to 129SvEv C57 hybrid mice to yield additional heterozygous animals for the intercross to generate the F2 mice. Level I phenotypic analysis was performed on mice from this generation as shown below.

Knockout homozygous and heterozygous mice showed an increased blood glucose level. In addition both also showed an increased level of ketones and proteins in the urine compared with wild type littermates and the historical mean.

Blood chemistry phenotypic analysis includes blood glucose measurements as well as urinalysis to determine if protein and or ketone bodies may be present. Abnormal glucose metabolism may indicate the following disorders or conditions cachexia Diabetes Type 1 and Type 2 Syndrome X and various cardiovascular diseases. The COBAS Integra 400 mfr Roche was used for running blood chemistry tests on the mice. The routine urinalysis is a screening test done to provide a general evaluation of the renal urinary system. The characteristics for which urine is routinely examined includes tests for protein glucose ketones blood bilirubin urobilinogen nitrate and leukocyte esterase as well as pH and specific gravity.

Results Blood chemistry and urinalysis tests results indicated increased levels of glucose in the blood as well as the presence of both protein and ketones in the urine for homozygous mutant mice and heterozygous mice compared with wild type littermates and the historical mean. These results suggest a phenotype associated with diabetes. As such PRO353 polypeptides and or its encoding gene would be useful in maintaining normal glucose metabolism.

In these knockout experiments the gene encoding PRO1885 polypeptides designated as DNA79302 2521 UNQ868 was disrupted. The gene specific information for these studies is as follows the mutated mouse gene corresponds to nucleotide reference AB053181 or ACE2 mRNA for angiotensin converting enzyme related carboxypeptidase protein reference BAB40431 or angiotensin converting enzyme related carboxypeptidase the human gene sequence reference NM021804 or angiotensin I converting enzyme peptidyl dipeptidase A 2 ACE2 protein reference BAB40370 or ACE2. Mutation type corresponds to Homologous Recombination standard . Coding exon 1 was targeted. Mutation appears to be X linked.

The gene that is mutated in these animals is represented by mouse UniGene cluster Mm.13451 which is the ortholog of human UniGene cluster Hs.178098 ACE2 . ACE2 encodes angiotensin I converting enzyme peptidyl dipeptidase A 2 also known as angiotensin converting enzyme related carboxypeptidase and ACEH OMIM 300335 . The physiological substrate for ACE2 is not precisely known. Unlike ACE which catalyzes the cleavage of the carboxy terminal dipeptide of biologically inactive Ang1 10 to the potent vasoconstrictor Ang1 8 ACE2 catalyzes the cleavage of the carboxy terminal residue of Ang1 10 to form Ang1 9 and the carboxy terminal residue of Ang1 8 to form Ang1 7. Moreover Ang1 8 is a 400 fold better substrate than Ang1 10. ACE2 is not inhibited by the ACE inhibitors linesopril or captopril.

Male ACE2 knockout mice at 6 months but not 3 months display decreased cardiac contractility and decreased blood pressure which is a consequence of decreased cardiac function. Apparently lack of ACE2 activity in ace2 null mice locally elevates Ang1 8 and causes vasoconstriction of coronary arteries and hypoxia in cardiomyocytes which damages cardiac tissue and culminates in heart dysfunction.

Targeted or gene trap mutations are generated in strain 129SvEv derived embryonic stem ES cells. The chimeric mice are bred to C57BL 6J albino mice to generate F1 female heterozygous animals. These progeny are crossed to hybrid 129SvEv C57 F1 mice derived from crossing 129SvEvmice to C57BL 6J mice to generate F1A wild type female heterozygous and male hemizygous mice. Level I phenotypic analysis is performed on mice from this generation.

This retroviral insertion is in an X linked gene. Only male hemizygous 0 and female heterozygous mice were analyzed whereas the wild type mice analyzed were both male and female. General Observations The female and male 0 albino mice had yellow tinted coats when compared with their albino littermates. Analyzed wt het hom 35 16 18

In the area of cardiovascular biology phenotypic testing was performed to identify potential targets for the treatment of cardiovascular endothelial or angiogenic disorders. One such phenotypic test included optic fundus photography and angiography to determine the retinal arteriovenous ratio A V ratio in order to flag various eye abnormalities. An abnormal A V ratio signals such systemic diseases or disorders that may be related to the vascular disease of hypertension and any disease that causes hypertension e.g. atherosclerosis diabetes or other ocular diseases corresponding to ophthalmological disorders. Such eye abnormalities may include but are not limited to the following retinal abnormality is retinal dysplasia various retinopathies restenosis retinal artery obstruction or occlusion retinal degeneration causing secondary atrophy of the retinal vasculature retinitis pigmentosa macular dystrophies Stargardt s disease congenital stationary night blindness choroideremia gyrate atrophy Leber s congenital amaurosis retinoschisis disorders Wagner s syndrome Usher syndromes Zellweger syndrome Saldino Mainzer syndrome Senior Loken syndrome Bardet Biedl syndrome Alport s syndrome Alstom s syndrome Cockayne s syndrome dysplaisa spondyloepiphysaria congentia Flynn Aird syndrome Friedreich ataxia Hallgren syndrome Marshall syndrome Albers Schnoberg disease Refsum s disease Kearns Sayre syndrome Waardenburg s syndrome Alagile syndrome myotonic dystrophy olivopontocerebellar atrophy Pierre Marie dunsdrome Stickler syndrome carotinemeia cystinosis Wolfram syndrome Bassen Kornzweig syndrome abetalipoproteinemia incontinentia pigmenti Batten s disease mucopolysaccharidoses homocystinuria or mannosidosis.

Procedure Optic fundus photography was performed on conscious animals using a Kowa Genesis small animal fundus camera modified according to Hawes and coauthors Hawes et al. 1999 Molecular Vision 1999 5 22 . Intra peritoneal injection of fluorescein permitted the acquisition of direct light fundus images and fluorescent angiograms for each examination. In addition to direct ophthalmological changes this test can detect retinal changes associated with systemic diseases such as diabetes and atherosclerosis or other retinal abnormalities. Pictures were provided of the optic fundus under normal light. The angiographic pictures allowed examination of the arteries and veins of the eye. In addition an artery to vein A V ratio was determined for the eye.

Ophthalmology analysis was performed on generated F2 wild type heterozygous and hemizygous mutant progeny using the protocol described above. Specifically the A V ratio was measured and calculated according to the fundus images with Kowa COMIT software. This test takes color photographs through a dilated pupil the images help in detecting and classifying many diseases. The artery to vein ratio A V is the ratio of the artery diameter to the vein diameter measured before the bifurcation of the vessels . Many diseases will influence the ratio i.e. diabetes cardiovascular disorders papilledema optic atrophy or other eye abnormalities such as retinal degeneration known as retinitis pigmentosa or retinal dysplasia vision problems or blindness. Thus phenotypic observations which result in an increased artery to vein ratio in homozygous and heterozygous mutant progeny compared to wildtype littermates would be indicative of such pathological conditions.

Results In this study male hemizygous 0 mice M 105 and M 112 exhibited heterogeneous retinal backgrounds with mild depigmentation spots which indicates early signs of retinal degeneration. In addition the hemizygous mice exhibited an increased mean artery to vein A V ratio when compared with their littermates indicative of retinal degeneration. In summary by knocking out the gene identified as DNA79302 2521 encoding PRO1885 polypeptides hemizygous mutant progeny exhibit phenotypes which are associated with retinal degeneration. Such detected retinal changes are most commonly associated with cardiovascular systemic diseases or disorders that are related to the vascular disease of hypertension and or any disease that causes hypertension e.g. atherosclerosis diabetes or other ocular diseases corresponding to ophthalmological disorders such as retinal degeneration. Thus antagonists of PRO1885 encoding genes would lead to similar pathological retinal changes whereas agonists would be useful as therapeutic agents in the treatment of hypertension atherosclerosis or other opthamological disorders including retinal degeneration and diseases associated with this condition as indicated above .

The following method describes use of a nucleotide sequence encoding a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide as a hybridization probe.

DNA comprising the coding sequence of full length or mature PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides as disclosed herein is employed as a probe to screen for homologous DNAs such as those encoding naturally occurring variants of PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides in human tissue cDNA libraries or human tissue genomic libraries.

Hybridization and washing of filters containing either library DNAs is performed under the following high stringency conditions. Hybridization of radiolabeled PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 derived probe to the filters is performed in a solution of 50 formamide 5 SSC 0.1 SDS 0.1 sodium pyrophosphate 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 6.8 2 Denhardt s solution and 10 dextran sulfate at 42 C. for 20 hours. Washing of the filters is performed in an aqueous solution of 0.1 SSC and 0.1 SDS at 42 C.

DNAs having a desired sequence identity with the DNA encoding full length native sequence PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides can then be identified using standard techniques known in the art.

This example illustrates preparation of an unglycosylated form of PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides by recombinant expression in

The DNA sequence encoding a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide is initially amplified using selected PCR primers. The primers should contain restriction enzyme sites which correspond to the restriction enzyme sites on the selected expression vector. A variety of expression vectors may be employed. An example of a suitable vector is pBR322 derived from see Bolivar et al. 2 95 1977 which contains genes for ampicillin and tetracycline resistance. The vector is digested with restriction enzyme and dephosphorylated. The PCR amplified sequences are then ligated into the vector. The vector will preferably include sequences which encode for an antibiotic resistance gene a trp promoter a polyhis leader including the first six STII codons polyhis sequence and enterokinase cleavage site the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 coding region lambda transcriptional terminator and an argU gene.

The ligation mixture is then used to transform a selected strain using the methods described in Sambrook et al. supra. Transformants are identified by their ability to grow on LB plates and antibiotic resistant colonies are then selected. Plasmid DNA can be isolated and confirmed by restriction analysis and DNA sequencing.

Selected clones can be grown overnight in liquid culture medium such as LB broth supplemented with antibiotics. The overnight culture may subsequently be used to inoculate a larger scale culture. The cells are then grown to a desired optical density during which the expression promoter is turned on.

After culturing the cells for several more hours the cells can be harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellet obtained by the centrifugation can be solubilized using various agents known in the art and the solubilized PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 protein can then be purified using a metal chelating column under conditions that allow tight binding of the protein.

PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 may be expressed in in a poly His tagged form using the following procedure. The DNA encoding PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 is initially amplified using selected PCR primers. The primers will contain restriction enzyme sites which correspond to the restriction enzyme sites on the selected expression vector and other useful sequences providing for efficient and reliable translation initiation rapid purification on a metal chelation column and proteolytic removal with enterokinase. The PCR amplified poly His tagged sequences are then ligated into an expression vector which is used to transform an host based on strain 52 W3110 fuhA tonA lon galE rpoHts htpRts clpP lacIq . Transformants are first grown in LB containing 50 mg ml carbenicillin at 30 C. with shaking until an O.D. 600 of 3 5 is reached. Cultures are then diluted 50 100 fold into CRAP media prepared by mixing 3.57 g NH SO 0.71 g sodium citrate.2H20 1.07 g KCl 5.36 g Difco yeast extract 5.36 g Sheffield hycase SF in 500 mL water as well as 110 mM MPOS pH 7.3 0.55 w v glucose and 7 mM MgSO and grown for approximately 20 30 hours at 30 C. with shaking. Samples are removed to verify expression by SDS PAGE analysis and the bulk culture is centrifuged to pellet the cells. Cell pellets are frozen until purification and refolding.

The proteins are refolded by diluting the sample slowly into freshly prepared refolding buffer consisting of 20 mM Tris pH 8.6 0.3 M NaCl 2.5 M urea 5 mM cysteine 20 mM glycine and 1 mM EDTA. Refolding volumes are chosen so that the final protein concentration is between 50 to 100 micrograms ml. The refolding solution is stirred gently at 4 C. for 12 36 hours. The refolding reaction is quenched by the addition of TFA to a final concentration of 0.4 pH of approximately 3 . Before further purification of the protein the solution is filtered through a 0.22 micron filter and acetonitrile is added to 2 10 final concentration. The refolded protein is chromatographed on a Poros R1 H reversed phase column using a mobile buffer of 0.1 TFA with elution with a gradient of acetonitrile from 10 to 80 . Aliquots of fractions with A280 absorbance are analyzed on SDS polyacrylamide gels and fractions containing homogeneous refolded protein are pooled. Generally the properly refolded species of most proteins are eluted at the lowest concentrations of acetonitrile since those species are the most compact with their hydrophobic interiors shielded from interaction with the reversed phase resin. Aggregated species are usually eluted at higher acetonitrile concentrations. In addition to resolving misfolded forms of proteins from the desired form the reversed phase step also removes endotoxin from the samples.

Fractions containing the desired folded PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide are pooled and the acetonitrile removed using a gentle stream of nitrogen directed at the solution. Proteins are formulated into 20 mM Hepes pH 6.8 with 0.14 M sodium chloride and 4 mannitol by dialysis or by gel filtration using G25 Superfine Pharmacia resins equilibrated in the formulation buffer and sterile filtered.

This example illustrates preparation of a potentially glycosylated form of a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide by recombinant expression in mammalian cells.

The vector pRK5 see EP 307 247 published Mar. 15 1989 is employed as the expression vector. Optionally the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 DNA is ligated into pRK5 with selected restriction enzymes to allow insertion of the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 DNA using ligation methods such as described in Sambrook et al. supra. The resulting vector is called pRK5 PRO227 pRK5 pRK5 PRO233 pRK5 PRO238 pRK5 PRO1328 pRK5 PRO4342 pRK5 PRO7423 pRK5 PRO10096 pRK5 PRO21384 pRK5 PRO353 or pRK5 PRO1885.

The selected host cells may be 293 cells. Human 293 cells ATCC CCL 1573 are grown to confluence in tissue culture plates in medium such as DMEM supplemented with fetal calf serum and optionally nutrient components and or antibiotics. About 10 g pRK5 PRO227 pRK5 pRK5 PRO233 pRK5 PRO238 pRK5 PRO1328 pRK5 PRO4342 pRK5 PRO7423 pRK5 PRO10096 pRK5 PRO21384 pRK5 PRO353 or pRK5 PRO1885 DNA is mixed with about 1 g DNA encoding the VA RNA gene Thimmappaya et al. 31 543 1982 and dissolved in 500 l of 1 mM Tris HCl 0.1 mM EDTA 0.227 M CaCl. To this mixture is added dropwise 500 l of 50 mM HEPES pH 7.35 280 mM NaCl 1.5 mM NaPO and a precipitate is allowed to form for 10 minutes at 25 C. The precipitate is suspended and added to the 293 cells and allowed to settle for about four hours at 37 C. The culture medium is aspirated off and 2 ml of 20 glycerol in PBS is added for 30 seconds. The 293 cells are then washed with serum free medium fresh medium is added and the cells are incubated for about 5 days.

Approximately 24 hours after the transfections the culture medium is removed and replaced with culture medium alone or culture medium containing 200 Ci ml S cysteine and 200 Ci ml S methionine. After a 12 hour incubation the conditioned medium is collected concentrated on a spin filter and loaded onto a 15 SDS gel. The processed gel may be dried and exposed to film for a selected period of time to reveal the presence of PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides. The cultures containing transfected cells may undergo further incubation in serum free medium and the medium is tested in selected bioassays.

In an alternative technique PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 may be introduced into 293 cells transiently using the dextran sulfate method described by Somparyrac et al. 12 7575 1981 . 293 cells are grown to maximal density in a spinner flask and 700 g pRK5 PRO227 pRK5 pRK5 PRO233 pRK5 PRO238 pRK5 PRO1328 pRK5 PRO4342 pRK5 PRO7423 pRK5 PRO10096 pRK5 PRO21384 pRK5 PRO353 or pRK5 PRO1885 DNA is added. The cells are first concentrated from the spinner flask by centrifugation and washed with PBS. The DNA dextran precipitate is incubated on the cell pellet for four hours. The cells are treated with 20 glycerol for 90 seconds washed with tissue culture medium and re introduced into the spinner flask containing tissue culture medium 5 g ml bovine insulin and 0.1 g ml bovine transferrin. After about four days the conditioned media is centrifuged and filtered to remove cells and debris. The sample containing expressed PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 can then be concentrated and purified by any selected method such as dialysis and or column chromatography.

PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 can be expressed in CHO cells. The pRK5 PRO227 pRK5 pRK5 PRO233 pRK5 PRO238 pRK5 PRO1328 pRK5 PRO4342 pRK5 PRO7423 pRK5 PRO10096 pRK5 PRO21384 pRK5 PRO353 or pRK5 PRO1885 can be transfected into CHO cells using known reagents such as CaPOor DEAE dextran. As described above the cell cultures can be incubated and the medium replaced with culture medium alone or medium containing a radiolabel such as S methionine. After determining the presence of PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide the culture medium may be replaced with serum free medium. Preferably the cultures are incubated for about 6 days and then the conditioned medium is harvested. The medium containing the expressed PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 can then be concentrated and purified by any selected method.

Epitope tagged PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 may also be expressed in host CHO cells. The PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 may be subcloned out of the pRK5 vector. The subclone insert can undergo PCR to fuse in frame with a selected epitope tag such as a poly his tag into a Baculovirus expression vector. The poly his tagged PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 insert can then be subcloned into a SV40 driven vector containing a selection marker such as DHFR for selection of stable clones. Finally the CHO cells can be transfected as described above with the SV40 driven vector. Labeling may be performed as described above to verify expression. The culture medium containing the expressed poly His tagged PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 can then be concentrated and purified by any selected method such as by Ni chelate affinity chromatography.

PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 may also be expressed in CHO and or COS cells by a transient expression procedure or in CHO cells by another stable expression procedure.

Stable expression in CHO cells is performed using the following procedure. The proteins are expressed as an IgG construct immunoadhesin in which the coding sequences for the soluble forms e.g. extracellular domains of the respective proteins are fused to an IgG1 constant region sequence containing the hinge CH2 and CH2 domains and or is a poly His tagged form.

Following PCR amplification the respective DNAs are subcloned in a CHO expression vector using standard techniques as described in Ausubel et al. Unit 3.16 John Wiley and Sons 1997 . CHO expression vectors are constructed to have compatible restriction sites 5 and 3 of the DNA of interest to allow the convenient shuttling of cDNA s. The vector used expression in CHO cells is as described in Lucas et al. 24 9 1774 1779 1996 and uses the SV40 early promoter enhancer to drive expression of the cDNA of interest and dihydrofolate reductase DHFR . DHFR expression permits selection for stable maintenance of the plasmid following transfection.

Twelve micrograms of the desired plasmid DNA is introduced into approximately 10 million CHO cells using commercially available transfection reagents Superfect Qiagen Dosper or Fugene Boehringer Mannheim . The cells are grown as described in Lucas et al. supra. Approximately 3 10cells are frozen in an ampule for further growth and production as described below.

The ampules containing the plasmid DNA are thawed by placement into water bath and mixed by vortexing. The contents are pipetted into a centrifuge tube containing 10 mLs of media and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes. The supernatant is aspirated and the cells are resuspended in 10 mL of selective media 0.2 m filtered PS20 with 5 0.2 m diafiltered fetal bovine serum . The cells are then aliquoted into a 100 mL spinner containing 90 mL of selective media. After 1 2 days the cells are transferred into a 250 mL spinner filled with 150 mL selective growth medium and incubated at 37 C. After another 2 3 days 250 mL 500 mL and 2000 mL spinners are seeded with 3 10cells mL. The cell media is exchanged with fresh media by centrifugation and resuspension in production medium. Although any suitable CHO media may be employed a production medium described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 122 469 issued Jun. 16 1992 may actually be used. A 3L production spinner is seeded at 1.2 10cells mL. On day 0 the cell number pH ie determined. On day 1 the spinner is sampled and sparging with filtered air is commenced. On day 2 the spinner is sampled the temperature shifted to 33 C. and 30 mL of 500 g L glucose and 0.6 mL of 10 antifoam e.g. 35 polydimethylsiloxane emulsion Dow Corning 365 Medical Grade Emulsion taken. Throughout the production the pH is adjusted as necessary to keep it at around 7.2. After 10 days or until the viability dropped below 70 the cell culture is harvested by centrifugation and filtering through a 0.22 m filter. The filtrate was either stored at 4 C. or immediately loaded onto columns for purification.

For the poly His tagged constructs the proteins are purified using a Ni NTA column Qiagen . Before purification imidazole is added to the conditioned media to a concentration of 5 mM. The conditioned media is pumped onto a 6 ml Ni NTA column equilibrated in 20 mM Hepes pH 7.4 buffer containing 0.3 M NaCl and 5 mM imidazole at a flow rate of 4 5 ml min. at 4 C. After loading the column is washed with additional equilibration buffer and the protein eluted with equilibration buffer containing 0.25 M imidazole. The highly purified protein is subsequently desalted into a storage buffer containing 10 mM Hepes 0.14 M NaCl and 4 mannitol pH 6.8 with a 25 ml G25 Superfine Pharmacia column and stored at 80 C.

Immunoadhesin Fc containing constructs are purified from the conditioned media as follows. The conditioned medium is pumped onto a 5 ml Protein A column Pharmacia which had been equilibrated in 20 mM Na phosphate buffer pH 6.8. After loading the column is washed extensively with equilibration buffer before elution with 100 mM citric acid pH 3.5. The eluted protein is immediately neutralized by collecting 1 ml fractions into tubes containing 275 L of 1 M Tris buffer pH 9. The highly purified protein is subsequently desalted into storage buffer as described above for the poly His tagged proteins. The homogeneity is assessed by SDS polyacrylamide gels and by N terminal amino acid sequencing by Edman degradation.

The following method describes recombinant expression of PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 in yeast.

First yeast expression vectors are constructed for intracellular production or secretion of PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 from the ADH2 GAPDH promoter. DNA encoding PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 and the promoter is inserted into suitable restriction enzyme sites in the selected plasmid to direct intracellular expression of PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885. For secretion DNA encoding PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 can be cloned into the selected plasmid together with DNA encoding the ADH2 GAPDH promoter a native PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 signal peptide or other mammalian signal peptide or for example a yeast alpha factor or invertase secretory signal leader sequence and linker sequences if needed for expression of PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885.

Yeast cells such as yeast strain AB110 can then be transformed with the expression plasmids described above and cultured in selected fermentation media. The transformed yeast supernatants can be analyzed by precipitation with 10 trichloroacetic acid and separation by SDS PAGE followed by staining of the gels with Coomassie Blue stain.

Recombinant PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 can subsequently be isolated and purified by removing the yeast cells from the fermentation medium by centrifugation and then concentrating the medium using selected cartridge filters. The concentrate containing PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 may further be purified using selected column chromatography resins.

The following method describes recombinant expression of PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 in Baculovirus infected insect cells.

The sequence coding for PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 is fused upstream of an epitope tag contained within a baculovirus expression vector. Such epitope tags include poly his tags and immunoglobulin tags like Fc regions of IgG . A variety of plasmids may be employed including plasmids derived from commercially available plasmids such as pVL1393 Novagen . Briefly the sequence encoding PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 or the desired portion of the coding sequence of PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 such as the sequence encoding the extracellular domain of a transmembrane protein or the sequence encoding the mature protein if the protein is extracellular is amplified by PCR with primers complementary to the 5 and 3 regions. The 5 primer may incorporate flanking selected restriction enzyme sites. The product is then digested with those selected restriction enzymes and subcloned into the expression vector.

Recombinant baculovirus is generated by co transfecting the above plasmid and BaculoGold virus DNA Pharmingen into Sf9 cells ATCC CRL 1711 using lipofectin commercially available from GIBCO BRL . After 4 5 days of incubation at 28 C. the released viruses are harvested and used for further amplifications. Viral infection and protein expression are performed as described by O Reilley et al. Oxford Oxford University Press 1994 .

Expressed poly his tagged PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 can then be purified for example by Ni chelate affinity chromatography as follows. Extracts are prepared from recombinant virus infected Sf9 cells as described by Rupert et al. 362 175 179 1993 . Briefly Sf9 cells are washed resuspended in sonication buffer 25 mL Hepes pH 7.9 12.5 mM MgCl 0.1 mM EDTA 10 glycerol 0.1 NP 40 0.4 M KCl and sonicated twice for 20 seconds on ice. The sonicates are cleared by centrifugation and the supernatant is diluted 50 fold in loading buffer 50 mM phosphate 300 mM NaCl 10 glycerol pH 7.8 and filtered through a 0.45 m filter. A Ni NTA agarose column commercially available from Qiagen is prepared with a bed volume of 5 mL washed with 25 mL of water and equilibrated with 25 mL of loading buffer. The filtered cell extract is loaded onto the column at 0.5 mL per minute. The column is washed to baseline Awith loading buffer at which point fraction collection is started. Next the column is washed with a secondary wash buffer 50 mM phosphate 300 mM NaCl 10 glycerol pH 6.0 which elutes nonspecifically bound protein. After reaching Abaseline again the column is developed with a 0 to 500 mM Imidazole gradient in the secondary wash buffer. One mL fractions are collected and analyzed by SDS PAGE and silver staining or Western blot with Ni NTA conjugated to alkaline phosphatase Qiagen . Fractions containing the eluted His tagged PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 are pooled and dialyzed against loading buffer.

Alternatively purification of the IgG tagged or Fc tagged PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 can be performed using known chromatography techniques including for instance Protein A or protein G column chromatography.

This example illustrates preparation of monoclonal antibodies which can specifically bind PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885.

Techniques for producing the monoclonal antibodies are known in the art and are described for instance in Goding supra. Immunogens that may be employed include purified PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides fusion proteins containing PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides and cells expressing recombinant PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides on the cell surface. Selection of the immunogen can be made by the skilled artisan without undue experimentation.

Mice such as Balb c are immunized with the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 immunogen emulsified in complete Freund s adjuvant and injected subcutaneously or intraperitoneally in an amount from 1 100 micrograms. Alternatively the immunogen is emulsified in MPL TDM adjuvant Ribi Immunochemical Research Hamilton Mont. and injected into the animal s hind foot pads. The immunized mice are then boosted 10 to 12 days later with additional immunogen emulsified in the selected adjuvant. Thereafter for several weeks the mice may also be boosted with additional immunization injections. Serum samples may be periodically obtained from the mice by retro orbital bleeding for testing in ELISA assays to detect anti PRO227 anti PRO233 anti PRO238 anti PRO1328 anti PRO4342 anti PRO7423 anti PRO10096 anti PRO21384 anti PRO353 or anti PRO1885 antibodies.

After a suitable antibody titer has been detected the animals positive for antibodies can be injected with a final intravenous injection of PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885. Three to four days later the mice are sacrificed and the spleen cells are harvested. The spleen cells are then fused using 35 polyethylene glycol to a selected murine myeloma cell line such as P3X63AgU.1 available from ATCC No. CRL 1597. The fusions generate hybridoma cells which can then be plated in 96 well tissue culture plates containing HAT hypoxanthine aminopterin and thymidine medium to inhibit proliferation of non fused cells myeloma hybrids and spleen cell hybrids.

The hybridoma cells will be screened in an ELISA for reactivity against PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885. Determination of positive hybridoma cells secreting the desired monoclonal antibodies against PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 is within the skill in the art.

The positive hybridoma cells can be injected intraperitoneally into syngeneic Balb c mice to produce ascites containing the anti PRO227 anti PRO233 anti PRO238 anti PRO1328 anti PRO4342 anti PRO7423 anti PRO10096 anti PRO21384 anti PRO353 or anti PRO1885 monoclonal antibodies. Alternatively the hybridoma cells can be grown in tissue culture flasks or roller bottles. Purification of the monoclonal antibodies produced in the ascites can be accomplished using ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by gel exclusion chromatography. Alternatively affinity chromatography based upon binding of antibody to protein A or protein G can be employed.

Native or recombinant PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides may be purified by a variety of standard techniques in the art of protein purification. For example pro PRO227 pro PRO233 pro PRO238 pro PRO1328 pro PRO4342 pro PRO7423 pro PRO10096 pro PRO21384 pro PRO353 or pro PRO1885 polypeptide mature PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide or pre PRO227 pre PRO233 pre PRO238 pre PRO1328 pre PRO4342 pre PRO7423 pre PRO10096 pre PRO21384 pre PRO353 or pre PRO1885 polypeptide is purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using antibodies specific for the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide of interest. In general an immunoaffinity column is constructed by covalently coupling the anti PRO227 anti PRO233 anti PRO238 anti PRO1328 anti PRO4342 anti PRO7423 anti PRO10096 anti PRO21384 anti PRO353 or anti PRO1885 polypeptide antibody to an activated chromatographic resin.

Polyclonal immunoglobulins are prepared from immune sera either by precipitation with ammonium sulfate or by purification on immobilized Protein A Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Piscataway N.J. . Likewise monoclonal antibodies are prepared from mouse ascites fluid by ammonium sulfate precipitation or chromatography on immobilized Protein A. Partially purified immunoglobulin is covalently attached to a chromatographic resin such as CnBr activated SEPHAROSE Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology . The antibody is coupled to the resin the resin is blocked and the derivative resin is washed according to the manufacturer s instructions.

Such an immunoaffinity column is utilized in the purification of PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide by preparing a fraction from cells containing PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide in a soluble form. This preparation is derived by solubilization of the whole cell or of a subcellular fraction obtained via differential centrifugation by the addition of detergent or by other methods well known in the art. Alternatively soluble polypeptide containing a signal sequence may be secreted in useful quantity into the medium in which the cells are grown.

A soluble PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide containing preparation is passed over the immunoaffinity column and the column is washed under conditions that allow the preferential absorbance of PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide e.g. high ionic strength buffers in the presence of detergent . Then the column is eluted under conditions that disrupt antibody PRO227 antibody PRO233 antibody PRO238 antibody PRO1328 antibody PRO4342 antibody PRO7423 antibody PRO10096 antibody PRO21384 antibody PRO353 or antibody PRO1885 polypeptide binding e.g. a low pH buffer such as approximately pH 2 3 or a high concentration of a chaotrope such as urea or thiocyanate ion and PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide is collected.

This invention is particularly useful for screening compounds by using PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptides or binding fragment thereof in any of a variety of drug screening techniques. The PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide or fragment employed in such a test may either be free in solution affixed to a solid support borne on a cell surface or located intracellularly. One method of drug screening utilizes eukaryotic or prokaryotic host cells which are stably transformed with recombinant nucleic acids expressing the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide or fragment. Drugs are screened against such transformed cells in competitive binding assays. Such cells either in viable or fixed form can be used for standard binding assays. One may measure for example the formation of complexes between PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide or a fragment and the agent being tested. Alternatively one can examine the diminution in complex formation between the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide and its target cell or target receptors caused by the agent being tested.

Thus the present invention provides methods of screening for drugs or any other agents which can affect a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide associated disease or disorder. These methods comprise contacting such an agent with an PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide or fragment thereof and assaying I for the presence of a complex between the agent and the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide or fragment or ii for the presence of a complex between the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide or fragment and the cell by methods well known in the art. In such competitive binding assays the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide or fragment is typically labeled. After suitable incubation free PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide or fragment is separated from that present in bound form and the amount of free or uncomplexed label is a measure of the ability of the particular agent to bind to PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide or to interfere with the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide cell complex.

Another technique for drug screening provides high throughput screening for compounds having suitable binding affinity to a polypeptide and is described in detail in WO 84 03564 published on Sep. 13 1984. Briefly stated large numbers of different small peptide test compounds are synthesized on a solid substrate such as plastic pins or some other surface. As applied to a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide the peptide test compounds are reacted with PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide and washed. Bound PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide is detected by methods well known in the art. Purified PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide can also be coated directly onto plates for use in the aforementioned drug screening techniques. In addition non neutralizing antibodies can be used to capture the peptide and immobilize it on the solid support.

This invention also contemplates the use of competitive drug screening assays in which neutralizing antibodies capable of binding PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide specifically compete with a test compound for binding to PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide or fragments thereof. In this manner the antibodies can be used to detect the presence of any peptide which shares one or more antigenic determinants with PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide.

The goal of rational drug design is to produce structural analogs of biologically active polypeptide of interest i.e. a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide or of small molecules with which they interact e.g. agonists antagonists or inhibitors. Any of these examples can be used to fashion drugs which are more active or stable forms of the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide or which enhance or interfere with the function of the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide in vivo c.f. Hodgson 9 19 21 1991 .

In one approach the three dimensional structure of the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide or of a PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide inhibitor complex is determined by x ray crystallography by computer modeling or most typically by a combination of the two approaches. Both the shape and charges of the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide must be ascertained to elucidate the structure and to determine active site s of the molecule. Less often useful information regarding the structure of the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide may be gained by modeling based on the structure of homologous proteins. In both cases relevant structural information is used to design analogous PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide like molecules or to identify efficient inhibitors. Useful examples of rational drug design may include molecules which have improved activity or stability as shown by Braxton and Wells 31 7796 7801 1992 or which act as inhibitors agonists or antagonists of native peptides as shown by Athauda et al. 113 742 746 1993 .

It is also possible to isolate a target specific antibody selected by functional assay as described above and then to solve its crystal structure. This approach in principle yields a pharmacore upon which subsequent drug design can be based. It is possible to bypass protein crystallography altogether by generating anti idiotypic antibodies anti ids to a functional pharmacologically active antibody. As a mirror image of a mirror image the binding site of the anti ids would be expected to be an analog of the original receptor. The anti id could then be used to identify and isolate peptides from banks of chemically or biologically produced peptides. The isolated peptides would then act as the pharmacore.

By virtue of the present invention sufficient amounts of the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide may be made available to perform such analytical studies as X ray crystallography. In addition knowledge of the PRO227 PRO233 PRO238 PRO1328 PRO4342 PRO7423 PRO10096 PRO21384 PRO353 or PRO1885 polypeptide amino acid sequence provided herein will provide guidance to those employing computer modeling techniques in place of or in addition to x ray crystallography.
