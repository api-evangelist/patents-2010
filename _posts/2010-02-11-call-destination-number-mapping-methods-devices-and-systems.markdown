This application claims priority from and the benefit of the filing date of U.S. Patent Application No. 61 250 753 filed 12 Oct. 2009 under title CALL DESTINATION NUMBER MAPPING METHODS DEVICES AND SYSTEMS. The contents of the above application is hereby incorporated by reference into the Detailed Description hereof.

There are a plethora of options for placing calls on mobile communication devices. New options are being constantly added while old options are often changed or removed altogether.

Implementations of the present disclosure are not limited to any particular operating system mobile device architecture server architecture or computer programming language.

Reference is made in this description to calls it will be appreciated that the described systems and methods are applicable to all types of calls including session based communications and are not limited to voice calls unless specifically indicated.

The present disclosure provides an example implementation of a call destination mapping method that includes a mobile communication device requesting a call action within the device for a first destination number of a call destination accessible by the mobile communication device through a wireless network mapping the first call destination number to a second call destination number in accordance with one or more call destination mapping rules stored on the device and replacing the first call destination number in the call action with the second call destination number.

Call actions include any request within a mobile communication device relating to a call destination number of an existing call or a call to be initiated. For example if a call is being initiated then a call action could be to start a call START CALL . Typically a call action is requested by a phone application and addressed to a wireless communication subsystem to exchange radio frequency signals with a wireless network to perform communication functions regarding the call destination number such as the connection of a call from the wireless network to a PSTN telephone public switched telephone network sometimes referred to as POTS plain old telephone service to a SIP session initiation protocol phone or to another mobile communication device possibly through one or more further wired or wireless networks. Example call destination numbers for a PSTN telephone or a cellular telephone would include a seven or ten digit telephone number in North America plus long distance prefix. An example call destination number for a SIP or other voice over IP VoIP destination would be an IP address telephone. Other call actions could include a request to transfer an existing call to a call destination number transfer or a request to add a party at a call destination number to a call conference .

Example implementations are provided wherein a plurality of call destination rules can be stored on the mobile communication device relative priorities can be assigned to the rules and the first call destination number can be mapped sequentially in accordance with a plurality of the call destination number mapping rules through one or more intermediate call destination numbers to the second call destination number.

Further example implementations are provided wherein a calling number destination rule includes a mobile communication device state condition and wherein prior to mapping a destination number to another destination number in accordance with the call destination number rule the mobile communication device determines if a device state matches the state condition and maps the destination number to another destination number only if the mobile communication device state matches the state condition for the rule. The mobile communication device may determine if a mobile device state matches a state condition by accessing on device functionality.

Other example implementations are provided wherein prior to storage on the device the rules are transmitted to the device by an administration server. The rules received by the mobile communication device may be stored in memory protected from user access. Example implementations are also provided wherein the mobile communication device is one of a plurality of mobile communication devices including rules transmitted to the mobile communication devices by the administration server. In some example implementations the rules transmitted to the mobile communication devices by the administration server are common to a plurality of the mobile communication devices for the administration server.

Still further example implementations are provided wherein the wireless network is a cellular wireless network. In some example implementations the rules include rules for replacing a first call destination number that is a long distance call destination number with a second call destination number that includes a long distance network access dialing code. Where the rule is for replacing the first call destination number that is a long distance call destination number with a second call destination number that includes a long distance network access dialing code the rule may include for example a location state condition and a corresponding long distance network access dialing code for the location state condition. Further example details of the above example method implementations and additional example implementations will be described herein.

Further example details of the above example structural implementation and additional example structural implementations will be described herein.

The present disclosure further provides an example implementation of a computer program product including a computer readable medium and stored on the computer readable medium computer readable instructions which when executed on the central processing unit cause the mobile communication device to carry out one or more of the example methods. Further example details of the above example computer program product and additional example computer program product implementations will be described herein.

Reference is first made to which shows in block diagram form a communication system in which example implementations of the present disclosure can be applied. The communication system comprises a number of mobile communication devices mobile devices which may be connected to the remainder of system in any of several different ways. Accordingly several instances of mobile communication devices are depicted in employing different example ways of connecting to system . Mobile communication devices are connected to a wireless communication network which may comprise one or more of a Wireless Wide Area Network WWAN and a Wireless Local Area Network WLAN or other suitable network arrangements. In some implementations the mobile communication devices are configured to communicate over both the WWAN and WLAN and to roam between these networks. In some implementations the wireless network may comprise multiple WWANs and WLANs .

The WWAN may be implemented as any suitable wireless access network technology. By way of example but not limitation the WWAN may be implemented as a wireless network that includes a number of transceiver base stations one of which is shown in where each of the base stations provides wireless Radio Frequency RF coverage to a corresponding area or cell. The WWAN is typically operated by a mobile network service provider that provides subscription packages to users of the mobile communication devices . In some implementations the WWAN conforms to one or more of the following wireless network types Mobitex Radio Network DataTAC GSM Global System for Mobile Communication GPRS General Packet Radio System TDMA Time Division Multiple Access CDMA Code Division Multiple Access CDPD Cellular Digital Packet Data iDEN integrated Digital Enhanced Network EvDO Evolution Data Optimized CDMA2000 EDGE Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution UMTS Universal Mobile Telecommunication Systems HSDPA High Speed Downlink Packet Access IEEE 802.16e also referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or WiMAX or various other networks. Although WWAN is described as a Wide Area network that term is intended herein also to incorporate wireless Metropolitan Area Networks WMAN and other similar technologies for providing coordinated service wirelessly over an area larger than that covered by typical WLANs.

The WWAN may further comprise a wireless network gateway which connects the mobile communication devices to transport facilities and through the transport facilities to a wireless connector system . Transport facilities may include one or more private networks or lines the public internet a virtual private network or any other suitable network. The wireless connector system may be operated for example by an organization or enterprise such as a corporation university or governmental department which allows access to a network such as an internal or enterprise network and its resources or the wireless connector system may be operated by a mobile network provider. In some implementations the network may be realised using the internet rather than an internal or enterprise network.

The wireless network gateway provides an interface between the wireless connector system and the WWAN which facilitates communication between the mobile communication devices and other devices not shown connected directly or indirectly to the WWAN . Accordingly communications sent via the mobile communication devices are transported via the WWAN and the wireless network gateway through transport facilities to the wireless connector system . Communications sent from the wireless connector system are received by the wireless network gateway and transported via the WWAN to the mobile communication devices .

The WLAN comprises a wireless network which in some implementations conforms to IEEE 802.11x standards sometimes referred to as Wi Fi such as for example the IEEE 802.11a 802.11b and or 802.11g standard. Other communication protocols may be used for the WLAN in other implementations such as for example IEEE 802.11n IEEE 802.16e also referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or WiMAX or IEEE 802.20 also referred to as Mobile Wireless Broadband Access . The WLAN includes one or more wireless RF Access Points AP one of which is shown in that collectively provide a WLAN coverage area.

The WLAN may be a personal network of the user an enterprise network or a hotspot offered by an internet service provider ISP a mobile network provider or a property owner in a public or semi public area for example. The access points are connected to an access point AP interface which may connect to the wireless connector system directly for example if the access point is part of an enterprise WLAN in which the wireless connector system resides or indirectly via the transport facilities if the access point is a personal Wi Fi network or Wi Fi hotspot in which case a mechanism for securely connecting to the wireless connector system such as a virtual private network VPN may be appropriate . The AP interface provides translation and routing services between the access points and the wireless connector system to facilitate communication directly or indirectly with the wireless connector system .

The wireless connector system may be implemented as one or more servers and is typically located behind a firewall . The wireless connector system manages communications including email messages to and from a set of managed mobile communication devices . The wireless connector system also provides administrative control and management capabilities over users and mobile communication devices which may connect to the wireless connector system .

The wireless connector system allows the mobile communication devices to access the network and connected resources and services such as a messaging server for example a Microsoft Exchange IBM Lotus Domino or Novell GroupWise email messaging server having a global address book and optionally other servers . The other servers may comprise a content server for providing content such as internet content or content from an organization s internal servers to the mobile communication devices in the wireless network and an application server for implementing server based applications.

The global address book comprises electronic contact records created and maintained by an IT information technology administrator of the network . Typically the global address book is maintained exclusively by the messaging server and there is no local copy on the mobile device . In addition the global address book typically comprises contact records for all users of the respective network e.g. enterprise . The contact records in the global address book may be one or more of individual contact records or user records or a group address or distribution list which lists multiple individual users .

The wireless connector system typically provides a secure exchange of data e.g. email messages personal information manager PIM data and IM data with the mobile communication devices . In some implementations communications between the wireless connector system and the mobile communication devices are encrypted. In some implementations communications are encrypted using a symmetric encryption key implemented using Advanced Encryption Standard AES or Triple Data Encryption Standard Triple DES encryption. Private encryption keys are generated in a secure two way authenticated environment and are used for both encryption and decryption of data.

The wireless network gateway is adapted to send data packets received from the mobile device over the WWAN to the wireless connector system . The wireless connector system then sends the data packets to the appropriate connection point such as the messaging server content server or application servers . Conversely the wireless connector system sends data packets received for example from the messaging server or other server to the wireless network gateway which then transmit the data packets to the destination mobile device . The AP interfaces of the WLAN provide similar sending functions between the mobile device the wireless connector system and network connection point such as the messaging server content server and application server .

The network may comprise a private local area network metropolitan area network wide area network the public internet or combinations thereof and may include virtual networks constructed using any of these alone or in combination. Computers may be connected to the network directly or indirectly via an intermediate communication network such as the Internet . When computers connect to the network indirectly e.g. via the Internet a VPN or other mechanism for securely connecting to the network may be appropriate. Computers may be of any suitable construction and include at least a processor and a display screen one or more user input devices and a memory each connected to the processor as is known in the art. The computers could be desktop computers laptop notebook netbook computers or combinations thereof and may have wired or wireless communication subsystems for connecting to the network .

A mobile device may alternatively connect to the wireless connector system using a computer via the network . In at least some implementations for security purposes the computers with which the mobile devices can connect to the wireless connector system are limited to computers which are directly connected to the network . A link may be provided for exchanging information between the mobile device and computer connected to the wireless connector system . The link may comprise one or both of a physical interface and short range wireless communication interface. The physical interface may comprise one or combinations of an Ethernet connection Universal Serial Bus USB connection Firewire also known as an IEEE 1394 interface connection or other serial data connection via respective ports or interfaces of the mobile device and computer . The short range wireless communication interface may be a personal area network PAN interface. A personal area network is a wireless point to point connection meaning no physical cables are required to connect the two end points.

It will be appreciated that the above described communication system is provided for the purpose of illustration only and that the above described communication system comprises one possible communication network configuration of a multitude of possible configurations for use with the mobile communication devices . The teachings of the present disclosure may be employed in connection with any other type of network and associated devices that are effective in implementing or facilitating wireless communication. Suitable variations of the communication system will be understood to a person of skill in the art and are intended to fall within the scope of the present disclosure.

Reference is now made to which illustrates a mobile device in which example implementations described in the present disclosure can be applied. The mobile device is a two way communication device having data and voice communication capabilities and the capability to communicate with other computer systems for example via the Internet. Depending on the functionality provided by the mobile device in various implementations the device may be a multiple mode communication device configured for both data and voice communication a smartphone a mobile telephone or a PDA personal digital assistant enabled for wireless communication or a computer system with a wireless modem.

The mobile device includes a rigid case not shown housing the components of the device . The internal components of the device are constructed on a printed circuit board PCB . The mobile device includes a controller comprising at least one processor such as a microprocessor which controls the overall operation of the device . The processor interacts with device subsystems such as a wireless communication subsystem sometimes referred to as a radio layer for exchanging radio frequency signals with the wireless network to perform communication functions. The processor interacts with additional device subsystems including a display screen such as a liquid crystal display LCD screen input devices such as a keyboard and control buttons flash memory random access memory RAM read only memory ROM auxiliary input output I O subsystems data port such as serial data port such as a Universal Serial Bus USB data port speaker microphone short range communication subsystem and other device subsystems generally designated as . Some of the subsystems shown in perform communication related functions whereas other subsystems may provide resident or on device functions.

The device may comprise a touchscreen display in some implementations. The touchscreen display may be constructed using a touch sensitive input surface connected to an electronic controller and which overlays the display screen . The touch sensitive overlay and the electronic controller provide a touch sensitive input device and the processor interacts with the touch sensitive overlay via the electronic controller.

The communication subsystem includes a receiver a transmitter and associated components such as one or more antenna elements and local oscillators LOs and a processing module such as a digital signal processor DSP . The antenna elements and may be embedded or internal to the mobile device and a single antenna may be shared by both receiver and transmitter as is known in the art. As will be apparent to those skilled in the field of communication the particular design of the wireless communication subsystem depends on the wireless network in which mobile device is intended to operate.

The mobile device may communicate with any one of a plurality of fixed transceiver base stations of the wireless network within its geographic coverage area. The mobile device may send and receive communication signals over the wireless network after the required network registration or activation procedures have been completed. Signals received by the antenna through the wireless network are input to the receiver which may perform such common receiver functions as signal amplification frequency down conversion filtering channel selection etc. as well as analog to digital A D conversion. A D conversion of a received signal allows more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding to be performed in the DSP . In a similar manner signals to be transmitted are processed including modulation and encoding for example by the DSP . These DSP processed signals are output to the transmitter for digital to analog D A conversion frequency up conversion filtering amplification and transmission to the wireless network via the antenna . The DSP not only processes communication signals but may also provide for receiver and transmitter control. For example the gains applied to communication signals in the receiver and the transmitter may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP .

The processor operates under stored program control and executes software modules stored in memory such as persistent memory for example in the flash memory . As illustrated in the software modules comprise operating system software software applications comprising an email messaging application also referred to as an email client a personal address book a calendar application a phone application and call destination mapping module . Example implementations of a call destination mapping module will be discussed in detail later herein. It is recognized that the call destination mapping module and its various components as described herein can form a discrete module running on the device or the functions of the call destination mapping module can be distribution on the device as separate modules or integrated within other existing modules as desired. Such discrete or distributed implementations all fall within the implementations of a call destination mapping module as described herein.

The software applications also may include a range of applications including for example a notepad application Internet browser application voice communication i.e. telephony application mapping application or a media player application or any combination thereof. Each of the software applications may include layout information defining the placement of particular fields and graphic elements e.g. text fields input fields icons etc. in the user interface i.e. the display screen according to the application.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the software modules or parts thereof may be temporarily loaded into volatile memory such as the RAM . The RAM is used for storing runtime data variables and other types of data or information as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Although specific functions are described for various types of memory this is merely one example and those skilled in the art will appreciate that a different assignment of functions to types of memory could also be used.

In some implementations the auxiliary I O subsystems may comprise an external communication link or interface for example an Ethernet connection. The mobile device may comprise other wireless communication interfaces for communicating with other types of wireless networks for example a wireless network such as an orthogonal frequency division multiplexed OFDM network or a GPS Global Positioning System subsystem comprising a GPS receiver or transceiver for communicating with a GPS satellite network not shown . The auxiliary I O subsystems may comprise a pointing or navigational input device such as a clickable trackball or scroll wheel or thumbwheel or a vibrator for providing vibratory notifications in response to various events on the device such as receipt of an electronic message or incoming phone call or for other purposes such as haptic feedback touch feedback .

In some implementations the mobile device also includes a removable memory card or module typically comprising flash memory and a memory card interface . Network access is typically associated with a subscriber or user of the mobile device via the memory card which may be a Subscriber Identity Module SIM card for use in a GSM network or other type of memory card for use in the relevant wireless network type. The memory card is inserted in or connected to the memory card interface of the mobile device in order to operate in conjunction with the wireless network .

The mobile device also stores other data in an erasable persistent memory which in one example implementation is the flash memory . In various implementations the data includes service data comprising information required by the mobile device to establish and maintain communication with the wireless network . The data may also include user application data such as email messages address book and contact information calendar and schedule information notepad documents image files and other commonly stored user information stored on the mobile device by its user and other data. The data stored in the persistent memory e.g. flash memory of the mobile device may be organized at least partially into a number of databases each containing data items of the same data type or associated with the same application. For example email messages contact records and task items may be stored in individual databases within the device memory.

The mobile device also includes a battery as a power source which is typically one or more rechargeable batteries that may be charged for example through charging circuitry coupled to a battery interface such as the serial data port . The battery provides electrical power to at least some of the electrical circuitry in the mobile device and the battery interface provides a mechanical and electrical connection for the battery . The battery interface is coupled to a regulator not shown which provides power V to the circuitry of the mobile device .

The short range communication subsystem is an additional optional component which provides for communication between the mobile device and different systems or devices which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example the subsystem may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components or a wireless bus protocol compliant communication mechanism such as a Bluetooth communication module to provide for communication with similarly enabled systems and devices.

A predetermined set of applications that control basic device operations including data and voice communication applications will normally be installed on the mobile device during or after manufacture. Additional applications and or upgrades to the operating system or software applications may also be loaded onto the mobile device through the wireless network the auxiliary I O subsystem the serial port the short range communication subsystem or other suitable subsystem . The downloaded programs or code modules may be permanently installed for example written into the program memory i.e. the flash memory or written into and executed from the RAM for execution by the processor at runtime. Such flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of the mobile device and may provide enhanced on device functions communication related functions or both. For example secure communication applications may enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using the mobile device .

The mobile device may provide two principal modes of communication a data communication mode and a voice communication mode. In the data communication mode a received data signal such as a text message an email message or Web page download will be processed by the communication subsystem and input to the processor for further processing. For example a downloaded Web page may be further processed by a browser application or an email message may be processed by the email messaging application and output to the display . A user of the mobile device may also compose data items such as email messages for example using the input devices in conjunction with the display screen . These composed items may be transmitted through the communication subsystem over the wireless network .

In the voice communication mode the mobile device provides telephony functions and operates as a typical cellular phone. The overall operation is similar except that the received signals are output to the speaker and signals for transmission are generated by a transducer such as the microphone . The telephony functions are provided by a combination of software firmware i.e. the phone application and hardware i.e. the microphone the speaker and input devices . Alternative voice or audio I O subsystems such as a voice message recording subsystem may also be implemented on the mobile device . Although voice or audio signal output is typically accomplished primarily through the speaker the display screen may also be used to provide an indication of the identity of a calling party duration of a voice call or other voice call related information.

The phone application can be split into multiple applications or sub modules for example one or more user phone modules and a call control module. The user phone modules provide a variety of telephony features through a user interface while the call control module provides access to common telephony functions desired by the user phone modules such that telephony requests from phone modules can be coordinated and so that the user phone modules do not need to each provide instructions understood by the wireless communications subsystem . The call control function typically makes telephony features available to user phone modules through an application programming interface API . It is to be recognized that all or part of the phone application features or functions could be provided through the operating system or otherwise distributed in the device while continuing to fall within the term phone application .

Call destination mapping rules including applicable state conditions can be stored separately from the call destination mapping module . The call destination mapping module acts as a listener for call actions from phone application . If a call action is requested then the call destination mapping module takes control of the call action before the call action is sent to the wireless communications subsystem .

The call destination mapping module reviews the rules to determine if any rule applies to the call destination number in the call action. For example a rule can be if the call destination number matches a call destination number pattern then replace the first digit with a dialing access code . For example in a long distance rule where an enterprise has entered into a long distance with a long distance provider that requires dialing a long distance network access code such as a local phone number followed by the original call destination number less a country code such as 1 for North America. Upon seeing the prefix one a dialing rule could replace the 1 in the call destination number with the long distance network access code. The call action could then be forwarded on to the wireless communications subsystem to process the call action or alternatively the call action could be returned to the phone application to call the wireless communication subsystem .

As part of the rule review any mobile communication device state condition for the rule is also evaluated to determine if a mobile communication device state matches the state condition . If mobile device states match state conditions can be determined for example by accessing on device functionality such as one or more auxiliary I O subsystems applications or operation system functions. An example of a location state condition has been discussed previously. Another example state condition could be current device time. The current device time could be obtained through a device clock for example through a clock application of the application that is often provided on a mobile communication device . The time could be used as a state condition for example to determine which long distance network dialing access code to utilize at a particular time.

Administration server is configured to enforce IT information technology policies on the mobile communication devices . IT policies are rules which govern the functionality of the mobile communication devices . As part of the IT policies a call destination mapping IT policy could be utilized as part of the mapping rule to provide both mapping rules and and the state conditions forming part of the mapping rules . As such the general application of IT policies is discussed below and it is understood that the discussion applies to IT policy . It is also noted that third party software applications could be provided with ability to install third party policies for example using JavaScript trade mark of Sun Microsystems from the device to allow for additional flexibility to access the methods and structures described herein.

The administration server may periodically transmit IT policy messages to enforce modify or terminate IT policies on the connected computing devices. The administration server transmits the IT policy messages through the wireless network to its managed mobile communication devices or via the physical interface e.g. serial data port such as a USB port or short range wireless communication interface e.g. Bluetooth connection when connected to the user s enterprise computer terminal . The IT policy messages may be security policies such as data protection security policies information and or security settings regarding these policies and or commands to be executed by the mobile communication devices . The IT policies can be set by an IT administrator of the enterprise network by sending an appropriate IT policy message to the mobile communication devices managed by the administration server . The periodic transmission of IT policy messages from the administration server the managed mobile communication devices assists in ensuring among other things that each of the mobile communication devices is kept up to date with the latest IT policy. The content and frequency of IT policy messages may be set by the IT administrator. In at least some implementations the administration server generates a private and public key pair for each mobile communication device to authenticate the IT policy messages. The IT policy private key is stored in the administration server . The IT policy public key is stored on the mobile communication device . The administration server digitally signs all IT policy messages using the IT policy public key which uses the IT policy public key to authenticate the digital signature in received IT policy messages.

In one implementation elements of the call destination number mapping rules are implemented via an IT policy message which is pushed out to the mobile communication devices . Using IT policy messages the mobile communication devices can be instructed to enforce modify or terminate aspects of the call destination number mapping rules . Using IT policy messages in this manner allows call destination number mapping rules to be added to mobile communication devices already managed by the administration server and in new mobile communication devices which are added to a list of devices managed by the administration server including new users device replacements or upgrades or device switches . In some implementations the IT administrator has the option of setting the IT policy globally for all mobile communication devices managed by the administration server or for groups or classes of mobile communication devices managed by the administration server or for one or more individual communication devices managed by the administration server . IT policies administered in this manner allow for central administration and distribution of rules without requiring individual user input. This process can be invisible to the user.

In some implementations the rules are stored in protected memory of the mobile communication device for example in flash memory . The protected memory is protected from user access device wipes for example device wipes initiated by the user or resulting from device replacements or switches or from triggered data security protections which erase data stored on the mobile communication device or both. Access to the protected memory is also restricted to authorized applications and typically authorized applications are restricted to authorized uses. Storage of the rules in protected memory prevents the user of the mobile communication device from accessing the rules and tampering with the rules in an attempt to modify or delete the rules or otherwise prevent or alter the rules . Methods of implementing memory protection are known in the art and will not be described.

Generally the IT policy rules may only be added updated or removed via an IT policy message sent via the administration server . In this way IT policy rules control authority is restricted to the administration server and the IT administrator. Typically the rules will only be accessible by the mobile communication device when the access request is received from an authorized program application such as the call destination number mapping module . Even in such cases access is typically limited to authorized purposes.

Referring to example rules are shown. Each rule is listed with a suffix a b c . . . to distinguish the rules in the FIG. for ease of reference.

Rule provides an example HELP call destination number mapping rule . For example rule could provide that if a call action is requested for the call destination number 4357 numeric equivalent of HELP in order to access a corporate help desk. The rule maps the number 4357 to a full PSTN phone number that can be dialed on the network to reach a corporate help desk for example at 14165555555 in North America. The rule could include a location state condition such that different help desk call destination numbers could be provided for different locations. For example a location state condition of Europe could have a European Help desk call destination number while a location state condition of North America could have a North American help desk call destination number. The help desk rule could be one rule with alternative state conditions and mapped call destination numbers or the help desk rule could be two separate rules each with separate state conditions and mapped call destination number.

Rule provides an example long distance call destination number mapping rule example implementations of which have been described earlier in this description. The rule could be applied to the call destination number 14165555555 from the application of rule . The order of rules provides assigned priorities for the application of the rules 

Rule provides an example roaming call destination mapping rule . For example rule could provide that if a call action is requested for a PSTN call destination number representing a corporate headquarters then the rule will check the roaming status condition of the device through a roaming indicator auxiliary i o subsystem and map the call destination number to an unpublished toll free call destination number such as a 1 800 number if the device is in a home non roaming coverage roaming state condition in order to reduce costs but will use the regular POTS number when device is in a roaming coverage roaming state condition . This example roaming rule assumes that the geographic roaming coverage and the geographic toll free number coverage are the same. For example a mobile communication device may have a rate plan for free roaming in North America and a toll free number may also cover North America. Alternative rules can be developed for different situations.

In the example implementation the rules are assigned priorities by the mapping module simply through the order in which the rules appear in the rules . Thus the mapping module applies each rule in sequence. If the application of one rule eg. results in replacement of the call destination number then the next rule eg. is applied to the replaced call destination number. Any call destination numbers that are replaced after the first original call destination number can be referred to as intermediate call destination numbers. Many alternate methods to assign priorities are possible and will be evident to those skilled in the art in light of the description herein. For example rules could be assigned priorities through a priority field not shown in the rule that could be searched by the mapping module to determine the order in which the rules are to be applied.

Multiple devices can be administered through the administration server . The administration server can provide common rules to a plurality of devices .

State conditions can be based for example on location information determined at the device for example by checking a GPS location of the device using a GPS auxiliary I O subsystem . Other methods of determining location information can be derived from cell towers with which the device is communicating. Also presence information can be used for example from on device applications such as the calendar application that may indicate the anticipated location of the user on a particular day and time. As will be evident to those skilled in the art there are other methods of determining a location for the device .

An example implementation of a rule employing a location state condition could be a device location long distance rule governing replacement of a long distance call destination number by a call destination number including a long distance network access code. For example if a call action is requested for a first call destination number a long distance mapping rule is applied. The rule has a location state condition that must be matched by the device state before the rule can be applied. The device determines a location for the device as described above.

Referring to an example method by which the mobile communication device can operate is set out. Such method can be embodied primarily in the mapping module executing on mobile communication device . At the mobile communication device requests a call action within the device for a first call destination number of a call destination. At the mobile communication device maps the first call destination number to a second call destination number in accordance with one or more call destination mapping rules stored on the device. At the mobile communication device replacing the first call destination number in the call action by the second call destination number.

Referring to a further example method by which the mobile communication device can operate is set out. At prior to requesting a call action the mobile communication device stores a plurality of call destination rules on the mobile communication device . At the mobile communication device assigns relative priorities to the rules . At a call action is requested by the mobile communication device from within the mobile communication device . At the mobile communication device mapping the first call destination number in accordance with a plurality of the call destination number mapping rules by priority through one or more intermediate call destination numbers to the second call destination number provided that the mobile communication device prior to mapping a destination number to another destination number in accordance with a call destination number rule determines if a mobile communication device state matches the state condition for the rule and the mobile communication device maps the destination number to another destination number only if the mobile communication device state matches the state condition for the rule .
