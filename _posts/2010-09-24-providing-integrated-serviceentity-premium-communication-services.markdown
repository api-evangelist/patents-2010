The subject specification generally relates to providing communication services and more particularly to systems methods and devices for providing integrated service entity premium communication services.

Mobile communication devices e.g. wireless mobile phone or smart phone electronic note pad electronic netbook etc. have become prevalent in everyday life. While a primary application of such devices can be phone calls the use of such devices for other applications including messaging e.g. text messages multimedia messages instant messages etc. location mapping social networking event documenting e.g. taking photographs or video recording audio etc. word processing etc. is ever increasing. The leveraging of mobile communication devices for other applications continues to extend to a variety of areas of subscriber s lives.

Currently subscribers can buy bundled services from a service provider wherein the bundled services can comprise fixed or wireline services e.g. home services such as television TV programming music programming home or landline phone with voice mail and or other phone features broadband Digital Subscriber Line DSL or other type of communication network connectivity etc. and wireless services e.g. wireless voice call services messaging services cellular or WI FI communication network connectivity etc. that can be utilized via a mobile communication device. However conventionally only the wireless services are considered portable. When the subscriber is on a vacation or business trip and stays in a hotel the subscriber will be provided with hotel specific communication services which can include a different room phone number different set of TV channels a TV channel to view bill or check out information credit card type room keys etc. All of the communication services offered by the hotel are not integrated. Accordingly today there is no way to desirably provide integrated hotel premium communication services that include integration of hotel specific communication services and the subscriber s bundled services.

The above described deficiencies of today s systems are merely intended to provide an overview of some of the problems of conventional systems and are not intended to be exhaustive. Other problems with the state of the art and corresponding benefits of some of the various non limiting embodiments may become further apparent upon review of the following detailed description.

The following presents a simplified summary of the various embodiments in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects described herein. This summary is not an extensive overview of the disclosed subject matter. It is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of the disclosed subject matter nor delineate the scope of the subject embodiments. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the disclosed subject matter in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.

Systems methods and devices that can integrate at least a desired portion of a subscriber s communication services e.g. home wireline communication services wireless communication services with service entity communication services e.g. hotel communication services are presented. In an aspect a subscriber s user equipment UE can be associated with a subscription for communication services comprising wireline e.g. Internet Protocol Television IPTV music services home phone and messaging services etc. and wireless communication services e.g. mobile phone services mobile messaging services application based services etc. of the subscriber wherein the wireline and or wireless communication services typically can be provided to the subscriber at a desired location e.g. subscriber s home or work office and the wireless communication services can be provided to the UE in locations where wireless communication is supported.

When the subscriber checks in or registers with a service entity e.g. hotel and or casino convention center entertainment venue etc. information associated with the subscriber s UE e.g. UE identifier portability key associated with the subscriber s communication services etc. and the subscriber can be provided to an enhanced service management component ESMC associated with the entity management system of the service provider to facilitate integrating the UE with the entity management system and integrating a desired portion of the subscriber s own communication services with the service entity s communication services. In accordance with various embodiments the ESMC can provide a unique security code to the UE or a radio frequency identification RFID tag comprising the security code can be associated with e.g. attached to the UE. In an aspect the entity management system can comprise a desired number of access points APs e.g. femto APs pico APs WI FI APs WI FI direct APs etc. that can be distributed throughout the premises of the service entity to facilitate providing desired wireless communication services to the UEs and other communication devices located in the coverage area of the APs wherein upon checking in or registering the UE identifier can be added to a list e.g. whitelist of allowed communication devices which is provided to the APs to facilitate communication by the UE via the APs while the UE is operating on the premises of the service entity.

In accordance with various aspects if the subscriber is part of a group of people e.g. one member of a family school group work group etc. all or a desired portion of the UEs of subscribers in the group can be registered and integrated at the same time as the initial subscriber or at a future time as desired. A same or different security code can be used for each UE in the group as desired. Further if any of the subscribers and associated UEs in the group are not present when the initial subscriber in the group is registered and the UE identifier s of the non present UE s has already been provided to the ESMC the ESMC can send the security code s to the non present UEs wherein for example the non present subscribers can use the non present UEs and the information in the message to register with the ESMC and be integrated with the entity management system. As desired for security reasons the message comprising the security code can be time sensitive wherein the message can be erased or become non accessible and or the information in the message can be rendered no longer valid by the ESMC after a predefined amount of time has elapsed without the non present UE s being registered. A subscriber of a non registered UE can register by going through the normal registration process e.g. register online register at reception or registration desk of the service entity etc. .

In an aspect when registered or otherwise associated with the service entity the subscriber s UE can be used to facilitate controlling a door lock to the subscriber s room provided by the service entity to the subscriber. In another aspect the UE can download an application e.g. UE integration application that can be employed to facilitate configuring the UE to be integrated with the entity management component. The UE can be configured to have a designated unlock button s that can be used to generate and transmit an unlock door request to the ESMC to facilitate unlocking the door lock for the subscriber s room. In accordance with various embodiments the unlock door request can comprise the UE identifier and or the security code which can be authenticated by the ESMC or door lock to facilitate validating the unlock door request. If the unlock door request is validated by the ESMC or the door lock e.g. when the UE communicates the unlock door request directly to the door lock and the door lock has the capability to authenticate the request the door lock can be unlocked and if the request is not validated the request can be denied.

In still another aspect using the UE or communication devices e.g. television TV and associated remote control unit in the subscriber s room provided by the service entity as desired at least a portion of the subscriber s communication services including at least a portion of the subscriber s wireline communication services can be integrated with the service entity s communication services such that the integrated communication services can be provided to the UE or other communication device e.g. subscriber s room TV for example while the subscriber is registered or otherwise associated with the service entity. For example when the subscriber s communication services and the service entity s communication services are provided by the same service provider a desired portion of the subscriber s own communication services e.g. up to a predefined number of TV or music channels or other video programming can be integrated with the service entity s communication channels for presentation on a communication device e.g. subscriber s room TV provided by the service entity e.g. in the subscriber s room at the service entity s premises . For instance the service entity s portal can be accessed using the UE or the room s TV and remote control unit and an API s can be invoked to connect with the service provider to facilitate selection of desired available communication services of the subscriber to be ported in or integrated with the service entity s communication services. If desired additional communication services of the subscriber can be integrated for example at a predefined cost per additional communication service. In an aspect employing the UE integration application the UE can be configured to have a hot soft button e.g. hot soft key that when manipulated e.g. pressed can allow the subscriber to use the UE to access the service entity s portal communication services or other available communication services in a same or similar as when the subscriber uses the room s remote control unit and TV to access the service entity s communication services. In an aspect the voice messaging and IP based network e.g. Internet services of the service entity also can be integrated with the subscriber s Unified Communication UC portal so that desired voice calls voice mail messages alerts etc. can be viewed from the same UC portal which can be accessed for example by the subscriber s UE when desired.

In still another aspect when a first service provider that provides the subscriber s communication services is different than a second service provider that provides the service entity s communication services a broker service e.g. video broker service can be employed to facilitate provision and integration of at least some of the subscriber s communication services wherein for example a charge plan can be agreed upon by the subscriber for the provision of the subscriber s communication services.

In an aspect as the UE moves through a wireless communication network environment at various times the UE can be connected e.g. wirelessly connected to one of a plurality APs e.g. macro AP femto AP pico AP etc. such as an AP e.g. femto AP pico AP etc. that can operate in the wireless communication network environment. An AP e.g. can serve a specified coverage area to facilitate communication by the UE in the wireless communication network environment. The AP can serve a respective coverage cell e.g. macrocell femtocell picocell etc. that can cover a respective specified area and the AP can service mobile wireless devices such as UE located in the respective area covered by the respective cell where such coverage can be achieved via a wireless link e.g. uplink UL downlink DL . When an attachment attempt is successful the UE can be served by the AP and incoming voice and data traffic can be paged and routed to the UE through the AP and outgoing voice and data traffic from the UE can be paged and routed through the AP to other communication devices e.g. another UE in the communication network environment. In an aspect UE can be connected and can communicate wirelessly using virtually any desired wireless technology including for example cellular WI FI WI MAX wireless local area networks WLAN etc.

In another aspect the communication network e.g. 2G 3G 4G or xG network where x can be virtually any desired integer or real value can facilitate wireless connection with the UEs connected to an AP e.g. AP macro AP not shown in and facilitate communication by the UE and or other UEs associated with the communication network with other communication devices e.g. wireless communication devices wireline communication devices in the communication network environment. The communication network e.g. a core network or network comprising a core network and or IP based network can facilitate routing voice and data communications between a communication device s e.g. UE and other communication devices e.g. UE landline phone computer email server STB multimedia server audio server video server news server financial or stock information server other communication devices etc. associated with the communication network in the communication network environment. The communication network also can allocate resources to the UEs in the communication network convert or enforce protocols establish and enforce Quality of Service QoS for the UEs provide applications or services in the communication network translate signals and or perform other desired functions to facilitate system interoperability and communication in the communication network e.g. wireless portion of the communication network or wireline portion of the communication network . The communication network further can include desired components such as routers nodes switches interfaces controllers etc. that can facilitate communication of data between communication devices in the communication network environment.

In another aspect system can include an entity management component that can cover and perform operations including provision of communication services controlling access to respective areas e.g. dedicated areas such as hotel rooms security of the service entity s premises etc. relating to or on behalf of the service entity e.g. hotel operator venue operator etc. . The entity management system can include a sufficient number of APs including AP so as to be able to cover all or at least a desired portion of the environment e.g. premises of the service entity to facilitate desired communication by and provision of desired services to communication devices e.g. UE and associated subscribers that are located on the service entity environment. The entity management system can be associated with e.g. connected to the communication network to facilitate communication between communication devices e.g. UE connected to the AP or other APs in the entity management system or connected via a wireline connection in the entity management system with other communication devices associated with the communication network .

The entity management system can provide desired communication services e.g. television TV services music services voice or phone services messaging services gaming services IP based services etc. via the communication network for which the service entity has a subscription wherein as desired the communications services can be provided to persons e.g. subscriber using UE associated with the service entity s environment e.g. connected to the entity management system using the UE when in the service entity s environment . In another aspect the entity management system also can comprise local communication services local comm. services e.g. service entity portal services voice services video services UE lock access control value added services etc. that can be provided to subscribers e.g. subscriber using UE associated with the service entity s environment.

At desired times the subscriber with the UE can enter into the environment of a desired service entity e.g. to check in and stay at a hotel wherein when the subscriber can register or check in with the service entity e.g. register or check in as a guest of the hotel . When registered or checked in the service entity can provide an integrated communication service experience by bridging the subscriber s services e.g. home communication services which can include wireless communication services and wireline communication services with the service entity s services comprising communication services and local communication services . The UE can connect to the AP e.g. when registered at the hotel and added to a list e.g. whitelist of allowed users permitted to access and use the AP and the service entity s communication platform to facilitate communication by the UE with other communication devices and integration of and access to the subscriber s services e.g. wireless communication services wireline communication services and service entity s services e.g. communication services and local communication services .

It is to be appreciated and understood that while not expressly shown in a portion of the communication network may be privately owned by the service entity e.g. the service entity may own at least some private branch exchanges PBXs to offer local phone services to subscribers and at least a portion of the local communication services can be provided via a local communication network associated with the service entity e.g. owned or operated by the service entity .

In accordance with various aspects the entity management system can include an enhanced services management component ESMC that can facilitate integration of the subscriber s services e.g. wireless communication services wireline communication services and the service entity s services e.g. communication services and local communication services provision of communication services controlling access to respective areas e.g. dedicated areas such as hotel rooms security of the service entity s premises etc. relating to or on behalf of the service entity . The AP and other APs that are part of the entity management system can be associated with e.g. connected to the ESMC .

In accordance with an aspect the UE can be integrated with the services of the service entity to configure the UE to be usable as a room key to control locking and unlocking of the lock on the room s door. For instance when registering with the service entity the subscriber s UE identifier e.g. cell phone number can be recorded by the entity management system e.g. the subscriber s UE identifier can be entered and stored in the ESMC via a computer associated with the entity management system . If the subscriber has other family members or business partners sharing the same room all or a desired portion of respective UE identifiers of respective UEs of the other members or partners also can be recorded by the entity management system . The ESMC can generate a security code that can be used by the UE and associated subscriber to facilitate controlling access to the subscriber s room at the service entity . The entity management system can be programmed in any desired manner of the various ways to manage the security code.

In an aspect an application e.g. services integration application can be downloaded to the UE for example during registration. The application can employed to install and configure the UE to utilize a UE side enhanced services management component UE ESMC that can be used to facilitate integration of the subscriber s services e.g. wireless communication services wireline communication services and the service entity s services e.g. communication services and local communication services use desired integrated communication services controlling access to respective areas e.g. dedicated areas such as the subscriber s room etc.

In one embodiment to facilitate using the UE to control the lock on the subscriber s door the security code can be a visible code that is provided to the subscriber and or UE . At a desired time e.g. during registering the UE can be configured to have a key programmed to be an unlock key that can be used e.g. pressed to unlock the room door of the subscriber. When the subscriber manipulates e.g. presses a preprogrammed unlock key on the UE the subscriber can be prompted to enter the security code into the UE via an interface e.g. keypad touchscreen keypad on the UE . In response to entering and sending the security code the UE employing the UE ESMC can transmit both the subscriber s UE identifier and the security code to the ESMC via the AP e.g. when AP is the AP providing coverage in the location where the door lock is located or another AP that is serving the UE wherein the ESMC can send a command to the room door to unlock the room. By having the subscriber enter a security code in addition to pressing an unlock key on the UE secure control of the door lock and room security can be facilitated.

In another embodiment the security code can be an invisible code that can be embedded in the UE e.g. in the UE ESMC . In this instance the subscriber can manipulate the unlock key on the UE to unlock the room door wherein the subscriber is not required to enter the security code into the UE to unlock the door. As the security code is embedded in the UE when the subscriber manipulates the unlock key the UE ESMC can send the security code and UE identifier to the ESMC which can send an unlock command to unlock the subscriber s room door.

In still another embodiment the security code is not provided to the subscriber or embedded in the UE but can be programmed in the lock on the subscriber s room door. When the subscriber manipulates the unlock key on the UE the UE identifier can be sent by the UE as facilitated by the UE ESMC to the ESMC and the ESMC can send a command to unlock the door and the door lock can be unlocked.

In yet another embodiment the security code can be a radio frequency identification RFID tag comprising a specified value e.g. security number that can be attached e.g. snapped onto pasted to the UE . When the subscriber manipulates the unlock key the UE as facilitated by the UE ESMC can transmit the UE identifier to the ESMC and the ESMC can compare and match the received RFID security code with the reader e.g. having a specified value that can be embedded in the room door lock of the subscriber s room. When there is a match between the received RFID tag and the reader the ESMC can send an unlock command to the door lock on the room and the door lock can be unlocked in response to the received unlock command.

In an aspect the door lock on the subscriber s room can be controlled based at least in part on location of the UE in addition to the UE identifier associated with the UE and the security code. For instance if the ESMC receives a request to unlock the door from the UE but the ESMC detects that the UE is in a location that is relatively far away from the door lock and associated room the ESMC can send an alert or prompt message to the UE to notify the subscriber that a door unlock request was received by the UE and prompt the subscriber to verify that the door unlock request was desired by the subscriber and or request authentication information or credentials from the subscriber to verify that the subscriber or other authorized person is actually the person making the door unlock request. The location of the UE can be identified by the ESMC using for example GPS Assisted GPS AGPS Cell ID WI FI and or Indoor etc. location techniques and or identifying the particular AP that is serving the UE at the time of the request wherein the location of the coverage area of the AP can indicate the location of the UE . Such features of the disclosed subject matter can facilitate reducing undesired unlocking of the door in response to accidental or undesired door unlock requests or undesired door unlock requests by unauthorized persons.

In certain instances the subscriber s may not have all the UEs presented during the check in time in such instances the subscriber s will have to provide all room members UE identifiers to be registered in the ESMC . In such instances there are a number of techniques that can be employed to preprogram these UEs so that they can be utilized as the room keys to the subscriber s room with the service entity . As desired in an aspect the security code can be the same for all UEs associated with a group or there can be different security codes for all or a desired portion of the UEs.

In one embodiment the ESMC can send a message e.g. SMS message MMS message to each of the UEs. The message can comprise information e.g. web site address link to the web site security code and or other information that can direct the UEs to a web portal associated with the ESMC to get the UEs preprogrammed to be used to control the lock on the room door. As desired the security code can be available and or displayed for a predefined amount of time e.g. 1 minute 2 minutes 3 minutes . . . after which the security code can be erased.

In another embodiment when the UE s are equipped with a near field communication NFC chipset the UE e.g. that has been preprogrammed can synchronize with other UEs using NFC capability. Because all possible guests UE identifiers were pre registered in the ESMC during the registration time a UE with a UE identifier that was pre registered can be configured to control locking unlocking the room door but a non registered UE identifier will not be able to unlock the room door.

In still another aspect the ESMC can track and log all lock and unlock transactions of a room by respective UE identifiers room number door lock identifier and or security code for example. Information relating to the transaction can be stored in a data store associated with the ESMC . When desired the information or a desired portion thereof e.g. as controlled by the service entity and or the subscriber can be provided to the subscriber of UE and or another authorized person s .

In yet another aspect if the UE is stolen or lost the subscriber can choose to remove the UE identifier from the authorized list or change the security code and the ESMC can update the information to make such changes to the subscriber s profile stored in the data store associated with the ESMC . For example the subscriber can request a service entity employee e.g. employee at the front desk of the hotel to reprogram the lock key code for the subscriber s room. The subscriber also can login to a service entity s portal e.g. using another UE to request to the ESMC to reprogram the subscriber s security key code e.g. using the security code and the UE identifier or remove the UE identifier from the authorized list stored in the data store. If other authorized UEs use the same security code and the code is changed the ESMC can generate and send an alert message comprising the new security code to those other UEs in the group wherein those UEs can be re programmed to be used as a room key as more fully disclosed herein.

In an aspect when the subscriber de registers or checks out with the service entity the ESMC can re program the lock on the room of the subscriber to a desired security code and the ESMC can update and store the information relating to the room with the new security code. For instance the lock can be re programmed after a de registration or checkout message is received e.g. at the front desk or via a self check out service associated with the ESMC .

In another aspect when the de registration or check out time is approaching but no de registration or check out action is performed the ESMC can send e.g. automatically send an alert message to the subscriber s UE that the lock will soon be re programmed unless an extension request is initiated by the subscriber. The subscriber can use the UE and UE ESMC to de register or check out or can issue an extension request and such action or request can be sent from the UE to the ESMC for processing. In one aspect the subscriber using the UE with the UE ESMC can even request to extend the registration e.g. stay at the hotel for a desired period of time e.g. one or more days by as little as a single manipulation of e.g. click on an extension request button that can be displayed on the display screen e.g. touch screen of the UE .

In still another aspect as desired by the service entity the ESMC can re program the door lock with a universal open code or more than one level of security code for example to allow maintenance activities especially when the room is not occupied e.g. by the subscriber . Whenever the door lock is locked or unlocked the ESMC can track these door transactions and store them in a central log that can be employed to facilitate tracking and maintaining all events or transactions relating to the door lock and associated room. As desired all or a desired portion of the events can be shared with the subscriber by the service entity via the ESMC . For example all or a desired portion of the activities involving the subscriber and others in his group e.g. family members and or other activities e.g. maid cleaning activities wherein the maid can use a different security code than the subscriber so the subscriber can learn when the room is being cleaned however the maid s security code will not provided to the subscriber and the subscriber will not be able to detect what security code the maid is using or has used can be provided to the UE or other communication device associated with the subscriber by the ESMC . The other activities can be respectively associated with different security codes or indicators that can be tracked and logged in the central log by the ESMC wherein the different security codes or indicators can facilitate providing information to the subscriber e.g. a desired portion of the information can be provided to the subscriber and service entity as to what types of activities have been performed in relation to the room when such activities occurred who participated in the activities etc.

In yet another aspect the UE can be integrated with the portal services associated with the ESMC and service entity . Integration of the UE with the portal services and operation of the UE to access the portal services can be facilitated by the ESMC and UE ESMC . For instance at a desired time e.g. during registration of the subscriber the UE can be programmed with a soft key hot key wherein programming and configuring of the UE to have the soft key hot key can be facilitated by the ESMC and UE ESMC . When the soft key hot key is manipulated e.g. pressed or clicked on the UE can be connected to the portal associated with the ESMC and service entity and the subscriber can be authenticated automatically or if additional security is desired the subscriber can be requested required to enter the security code associated with the subscriber s room or other authentication credentials wherein the ESMC can compare the received UE identifier security code or authentication credentials to facilitate authenticating the UE and associated subscriber.

In some aspects the teachings herein can or may be employed in a network that includes macro scale coverage e.g. a large area cellular network such as a 3G network typically referred to as a macrocell network and smaller scale coverage e.g. a residence based or building based network environment . As an access terminal AT moves through such a network the AT may be served in certain locations by access nodes ANs that provide macro coverage while the AT may be served at other locations by access nodes that provide smaller scale coverage. In some aspects the smaller coverage nodes may be used to provide incremental capacity growth in building coverage and different services e.g. for a more robust user experience . In the discussion herein a node that provides coverage over a relatively large area may be referred to as a macro node. A node that provides coverage over a relatively small area e.g. a residence may be referred to as a femto node. A node that provides coverage over an area that is smaller than a macro area and larger than a femto area may be referred to as a pico node e.g. providing coverage within a commercial building .

A cell associated with a macro node a femto node or a pico node may be referred to as a macrocell a femtocell or a picocell respectively. In some implementations each cell may be further associated with e.g. divided into one or more sectors.

In various applications other terminology may be used to reference a macro node a femto node or a pico node. For example a macro node may be configured or referred to as an access node base station access point eNodeB macro cell and so on. Also a femto node may be configured or referred to as a Home NodeB Home eNodeB access point base station femtocell and so on.

Referring again to the owner of a femto node may subscribe to mobile service such as for example 3G mobile service offered through the mobile operator core network . In addition an access terminal may be capable of operating both in macro environments and in smaller scale e.g. residential network environments. In other words depending on the current location of the access terminal the access terminal may be served by an access node of the macro cell mobile network or by any one of a set of femto nodes e.g. the femto nodes A and B that reside within a corresponding user residence . For example when a subscriber is outside his home he is served by a standard macro access node e.g. node and when the subscriber is at home he is served by a femto node e.g. node A . Here it should be appreciated that a femto node may be backward compatible with existing access terminals .

A femto node may be deployed on a single frequency or in the alternative on multiple frequencies. Depending on the particular configuration the single frequency or one or more of the multiple frequencies may overlap with one or more frequencies used by a macro node e.g. node .

In some aspects an access terminal may be configured to connect to a preferred femto node e.g. the home femto node of the access terminal whenever such connectivity is possible. For example whenever the access terminal is within the user s residence it may be desired that the access terminal communicate only with the home femto node .

In some aspects if the access terminal operates within the macro cellular network but is not residing on its most preferred network e.g. as defined in a preferred roaming list the access terminal may continue to search for the most preferred network e.g. the preferred femto node using a Better System Reselection BSR which may involve a periodic scanning of available systems to determine whether better systems are currently available and subsequent efforts to associate with such preferred systems. With the acquisition entry the access terminal may limit the search for specific band and channel. For example the search for the most preferred system may be repeated periodically. Upon discovery of a preferred femto node the access terminal selects the femto node for camping within its coverage area.

A femto node may be restricted in some aspects. For example a given femto node may only provide certain services to certain access terminals. In deployments with so called restricted or closed association a given access terminal may only be served by the macro cell mobile network and a defined set of femto nodes e.g. the femto nodes that reside within the corresponding user residence . In some implementations a node may be restricted to not provide for at least one node at least one of signaling data access registration paging or service.

In some aspects a restricted femto node which may also be referred to as a Closed Subscriber Group Home NodeB is one that provides service to a restricted provisioned set of access terminals. This set may be temporarily or permanently extended as necessary. In some aspects a Closed Subscriber Group CSG may be defined as the set of access nodes e.g. femto nodes that share a common access control list of access terminals. A channel on which all femto nodes or all restricted femto nodes in a region operate may be referred to as a femto channel.

Various relationships may thus exist between a given femto node and a given access terminal. For example from the perspective of an access terminal an open femto node may refer to a femto node with no restricted association. A restricted femto node may refer to a femto node that is restricted in some manner e.g. restricted for association and or registration . A home femto node may refer to a femto node on which the access terminal is authorized to access and operate on. A guest femto node may refer to a femto node on which an access terminal is temporarily authorized to access or operate on. An alien femto node may refer to a femto node on which the access terminal is not authorized to access or operate on except for perhaps emergency situations e.g. 911 calls .

From a restricted femto node perspective a home access terminal may refer to an access terminal that authorized to access the restricted femto node. A guest access terminal may refer to an access terminal with temporary access to the restricted femto node. An alien access terminal may refer to an access terminal that does not have permission to access the restricted femto node except for perhaps emergency situations for example such as 911 calls e.g. an access terminal that does not have the credentials or permission to register with the restricted femto node .

For convenience the disclosure herein describes various functionality in the context of a femto node. It should be appreciated however that a pico node may provide the same or similar functionality for a larger coverage area. For example a pico node may be restricted a home pico node may be defined for a given access terminal and so on.

A wireless multiple access communication system may simultaneously support communication for multiple wireless access terminals. As mentioned above each terminal may communicate with one or more base stations via transmissions on the forward and reverse links. The forward link or downlink refers to the communication link from the base stations to the terminals and the reverse link or uplink refers to the communication link from the terminals to the base stations. This communication link may be established via a single in single out system a multiple in multiple out MIMO system or some other type of system.

A MIMO system employs multiple N transmit antennas and multiple N receive antennas for data transmission. A MIMO channel formed by the Ntransmit and Nreceive antennas may be decomposed into Nindependent channels which are also referred to as spatial channels where N minN N. Each of the Nindependent channels corresponds to a dimension. The MIMO system may provide improved performance e.g. higher throughput and or greater reliability if the additional dimensionalities created by the multiple transmit and receive antennas are utilized.

A MIMO system may support time division duplex TDD and frequency division duplex FDD . In a TDD system the forward and reverse link transmissions are on the same frequency region so that the reciprocity principle allows the estimation of the forward link channel from the reverse link channel. This enables the access point to extract transmit beam forming gain on the forward link when multiple antennas are available at the access point.

The teachings herein may be incorporated into a node e.g. a device employing various components for communicating with at least one other node. depicts several sample components that may be employed to facilitate communication between nodes. Specifically illustrates a wireless device e.g. an access point and a wireless device e.g. an access terminal of a MIMO system . At the device traffic data for a number of data streams is provided from a data source to a transmit TX data processor .

In some aspects each data stream is transmitted over a respective transmit antenna. The TX data processor formats codes and interleaves the traffic data for each data stream based on a particular coding scheme selected for that data stream to provide coded data.

The coded data for each data stream may be multiplexed with pilot data using OFDM techniques. The pilot data is typically a known data pattern that is processed in a known manner and may be used at the receiver system to estimate the channel response. The multiplexed pilot and coded data for each data stream is then modulated i.e. symbol mapped based on a particular modulation scheme e.g. BPSK QSPK M PSK or M QAM selected for that data stream to provide modulation symbols. The data rate coding and modulation for each data stream may be determined by instructions performed by a processor . A data memory may store program code data and other information used by the processor or other components of the device .

The modulation symbols for all data streams are then provided to a TX MIMO processor which may further process the modulation symbols e.g. for OFDM . The TX MIMO processor then provides Nmodulation symbol streams to Ntransceivers XCVR A through T. In some aspects the TX MIMO processor applies beam forming weights to the symbols of the data streams and to the antenna from which the symbol is being transmitted.

Each transceiver receives and processes a respective symbol stream to provide one or more analog signals and further conditions e.g. amplifies filters and upconverts the analog signals to provide a modulated signal suitable for transmission over the MIMO channel. Nmodulated signals from transceivers A through T are then transmitted from Nantennas A through T respectively.

At the device the transmitted modulated signals are received by Nantennas A through R and the received signal from each antenna is provided to a respective transceiver XCVR A through R. Each transceiver conditions e.g. filters amplifies and downconverts a respective received signal digitizes the conditioned signal to provide samples and further processes the samples to provide a corresponding received symbol stream.

A receive RX data processor then receives and processes the Nreceived symbol streams from Ntransceivers based on a particular receiver processing technique to provide N detected symbol streams. The RX data processor then demodulates deinterleaves and decodes each detected symbol stream to recover the traffic data for the data stream. The processing by the RX data processor is complementary to that performed by the TX MIMO processor and the TX data processor at the device .

A processor periodically determines which pre coding matrix to use discussed below . The processor formulates a reverse link message comprising a matrix index portion and a rank value portion. A data memory may store program code data and other information used by the processor or other components of the device .

The reverse link message may comprise various types of information regarding the communication link and or the received data stream. The reverse link message is then processed by a TX data processor which also receives traffic data for a number of data streams from a data source modulated by a modulator conditioned by the transceivers A through R and transmitted back to the device .

At the device the modulated signals from the device are received by the antennas conditioned by the transceivers demodulated by a demodulator DEMOD and processed by a RX data processor to extract the reverse link message transmitted by the device . The processor then determines which pre coding matrix to use for determining the beam forming weights then processes the extracted message.
