Passwords may be used in many situations where a user needs to be authenticated. Situations requiring authentication may include the ability to access or use a computer mobile phone PDA or any other device. They may also enable access to a physical location or allow use of a credit debit card or similar instrument. Passwords are typically alpha numeric strings or sequences entered on a keyboard. Graphical authentication systems where passwords are comprised of graphical components also exist.

In some graphical authentication systems a user must move a previously selected reference point on an overlay image such as a grid to a previously selected reference point on a base image. With existing graphical authentication systems shoulder surfing can occur. For example a third party observer may be able to determine where a cursor is located at the end of the authentication process. In some situations a third party observer may observe where the user s fingers are pointing. In other situations a computer algorithm could be used to determine a pattern of where certain points on the overlay image are located at the end of the authentication process.

Thus the present disclosure proposes a graphical authentication system in which moving images are used.

The communication system comprises a number of mobile communication devices mobile devices which may be connected to the remainder of system in any of several different ways. Accordingly several instances of mobile communication devices are depicted in employing different example ways of connecting to system . Mobile communication devices are connected to a wireless communication network which may comprise one or more of a Wireless Wide Area Network WWAN and a Wireless Local Area Network WLAN or other suitable network arrangements. In some embodiments the mobile communication devices are configured to communicate over both the WWAN and WLAN and to roam between these networks. In some embodiments the wireless network may comprise multiple WWANs and WLANs .

The WWAN may be implemented as any suitable wireless access network technology. By way of example but not limitation the WWAN may be implemented as a wireless network that includes a number of transceiver base stations one of which is shown in where each of the base stations provides wireless Radio Frequency RF coverage to a corresponding area or cell.

Although WWAN is described as a Wide Area network that term is intended herein also to incorporate wireless Metropolitan Area Networks WMAN and other similar technologies for providing coordinated service wirelessly over an area larger than that covered by typical WLANs.

The WWAN may further comprise a wireless network gateway which connects the mobile communication devices to transport facilities and through the transport facilities to a wireless connector system . Transport facilities may include one or more private networks or lines the public internet a virtual private network or any other suitable network. The wireless connector system may be operated for example by an organization or enterprise such as a corporation university or governmental department which allows access to a network such as an internal or enterprise network and its resources or the wireless connector system may be operated by a mobile network provider. In some embodiments the network may be realised using the internet rather than an internal or enterprise network.

The wireless network gateway provides an interface between the wireless connector system and the WWAN which facilitates communication between the mobile communication devices and other devices not shown connected directly or indirectly to the WWAN . Accordingly communications sent via the mobile communication devices are transported via the WWAN and the wireless network gateway through transport facilities to the wireless connector system . Communications sent from the wireless connector system are received by the wireless network gateway and transported via the WWAN to the mobile communication devices .

The WLAN comprises a wireless network which in some embodiments conforms to IEEE 802.11x standards sometimes referred to as Wi Fi such as for example the IEEE 802.11a 802.11b and or 802.11g standard. Other communication protocols may be used for the WLAN in other embodiments such as for example IEEE 802.11n IEEE 802.16e also referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or WIMAX or IEEE 802.20 also referred to as Mobile Wireless Broadband Access . The WLAN includes one or more wireless RF Access Points AP one of which is shown in that collectively provide a WLAN coverage area.

The WLAN may be a personal network of the user an enterprise network or a hotspot offered by an Internet service provider ISP a mobile network provider or a property owner in a public or semi public area for example. The access points are connected to an access point AP interface which may connect to the wireless connector system directly for example if the access point is part of an enterprise WLAN in which the wireless connector system resides or indirectly via the transport facilities if the access point is a personal Wi H network or Wi Fi hotspot in which case a mechanism for securely connecting to the wireless connector system such as a virtual private network VPN may be appropriate . The AP interface provides translation and routing services between the access points and the wireless connector system to facilitate communication directly or indirectly with the wireless connector system .

The wireless connector system may be implemented as one or more servers and is typically located behind a firewall . The wireless connector system manages communications including email messages to and from a set of managed mobile communication devices . The wireless connector system also provides administrative control and management capabilities over users and mobile communication devices which may connect to the wireless connector system .

The wireless connector system allows the mobile communication devices to access the network and connected resources and services such as a messaging server for example a Microsoft Exchange IBM Lotus Domino or Novell GroupWise email messaging server having a global address book and optionally other servers . The other servers may comprise a content server for providing content such as internet content or content from an organization s internal servers to the mobile communication devices in the wireless network and an application server for implementing server based applications.

The global address book comprises electronic contact records generated and maintained by an IT information technology administrator of the network . Typically the global address book is maintained exclusively by the messaging server and there is no local copy on the mobile device . In addition the global address book typically comprises contact records for all users of the respective network e.g. enterprise . The contact records in the global address book may be one or more of individual contact records or user records or a group address or distribution list which lists multiple individual users .

The wireless connector system typically provides a secure exchange of data e.g. email messages personal information manager PIM data and IM data with the mobile communication devices . In some embodiments communications between the wireless connector system and the mobile communication devices are encrypted. In some embodiments communications are encrypted using a symmetric encryption key implemented using Advanced Encryption Standard AES or Triple Data Encryption Standard Triple DES encryption. Private encryption keys are generated in a secure two way authenticated environment and are used for both encryption and decryption of data.

The wireless network gateway is adapted to send data packets received from the mobile device over the WWAN to the wireless connector system . The wireless connector system then sends the data packets to the appropriate connection point such as the messaging server content server not shown or application servers . Conversely the wireless connector system sends data packets received for example from the messaging server or other server to the wireless network gateway which then transmit the data packets to the destination mobile device . The AP interfaces of the WLAN provide similar sending functions between the mobile device the wireless connector system and network connection point such as the messaging server content server and application server .

The network may comprise a private local area network metropolitan area network wide area network the public internet or combinations thereof and may include virtual networks constructed using any of these alone or in combination.

The mobile device includes a rigid case not shown housing the components of the device . The internal components of the device are constructed on a printed circuit board PCB . The mobile device includes a controller comprising at least one processor such as a microprocessor which controls the overall operation of the device . The processor interacts with device subsystems such as a wireless communication subsystem sometimes referred to as a radio layer for exchanging radio frequency signals with the wireless network to perform communication functions. The processor interacts with additional device subsystems including a display screen such as a liquid crystal display LCD screen input devices such as a keyboard and control buttons flash memory random access memory RAM read only memory ROM auxiliary input output I O subsystems data port such as serial data port such as a Universal Serial Bus USB data port speaker microphone short range communication subsystem and other device subsystems generally designated as .

The mobile device may communicate with any one of a plurality of fixed transceiver base stations of the wireless network within its geographic coverage area. The mobile device may send and receive communication signals over the wireless network after the required network registration or activation procedures have been completed. Signals received by the antenna through the wireless network are input to the receiver which may perform such common receiver functions as signal amplification frequency down conversion filtering channel selection etc. as well as analog to digital A D conversion. A D conversion of a received signal allows more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding to be performed in the DSP . In a similar manner signals to be transmitted are processed including modulation and encoding for example by the DSP . These DSP processed signals are output to the transmitter for digital to analog D A conversion frequency up conversion filtering amplification and transmission to the wireless network via the antenna . The DSP not only processes communication signals but may also provide for receiver and transmitter control. For example the gains applied to communication signals in the receiver and the transmitter may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP .

Each of the software applications may include layout information defining the placement of particular fields and graphic elements e.g. text fields input fields icons etc. in the user interface i.e. the display screen according to the application.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the software modules or parts thereof may be temporarily loaded into volatile memory such as the RAM . The RAM is used for storing runtime data variables and other types of data or information as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Although specific functions are described for various types of memory this is merely one example and those skilled in the art will appreciate that a different assignment of functions to types of memory could also be used.

In some embodiments the auxiliary I O subsystems may comprise an external communication link or interface for example an Ethernet connection. The mobile device may comprise other wireless communication interfaces for communicating with other types of wireless networks for example a wireless network such as an orthogonal frequency division multiplexed OFDM network or a GPS Global Positioning System subsystem comprising a GPS receiver or transceiver for communicating with a GPS satellite network not shown . The auxiliary I O subsystems may comprise a pointing or navigational input device such as a touchpad a clickable trackball or scroll wheel or thumbwheel or a vibrator for providing vibratory notifications in response to various events on the device such as receipt of an electronic message or incoming phone call or for other purposes such as haptic feedback touch feedback .

In some embodiments the mobile device also includes a removable memory card or module typically comprising flash memory and a memory card interface . Network access is typically associated with a subscriber or user of the mobile device via the memory card which may be a Subscriber Identity Module SIM card for use in a GSM network or other type of memory card for use in the relevant wireless network type. The memory card is inserted in or connected to the memory card interface of the mobile device in order to operate in conjunction with the wireless network .

The mobile device also stores other data in an erasable persistent memory which in one example embodiment is the flash memory . In various embodiments the data includes service data comprising information required by the mobile device to establish and maintain communication with the wireless network . The data may also include user application data such as email messages address book and contact information calendar and schedule information notepad documents image files and other commonly stored user information stored on the mobile device by its user and other data. The data stored in the persistent memory e.g. flash memory of the mobile device may be organized at least partially into a number of databases each containing data items of the same data type or associated with the same application. For example email messages contact records and task items may be stored in individual databases within the device memory.

The mobile device also includes a battery as a power source which is typically one or more rechargeable batteries that may be charged for example through charging circuitry coupled to a battery interface such as the serial data port . The battery provides electrical power to at least some of the electrical circuitry in the mobile device and the battery interface provides a mechanical and electrical connection for the battery . The battery interface is coupled to a regulator not shown which provides power V to the circuitry of the mobile device .

The short range communication subsystem is an additional optional component which provides for communication between the mobile device and different systems or devices which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example the subsystem may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components or a wireless bus protocol compliant communication mechanism such as a Bluetooth communication module to provide for communication with similarly enabled systems and devices.

A predetermined set of applications that control basic device operations including data and voice communication applications will normally be installed on the mobile device during or after manufacture. Additional applications and or upgrades to the operating system or software applications may also be loaded onto the mobile device through the wireless network the auxiliary I O subsystem the serial port the short range communication subsystem or other suitable subsystem . The downloaded programs or code modules may be permanently installed for example written into the program memory i.e. the flash memory or written into and executed from the RAM for execution by the processor at runtime. Such flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of the mobile device and may provide enhanced on device functions communication related functions or both. For example secure communication applications may enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using the mobile device .

The mobile device may provide two principal modes of communication a data communication mode and a voice communication mode. In the data communication mode a received data signal such as a text message an email message or Web page download will be processed by the communication subsystem and input to the processor for further processing. For example a downloaded Web page may be further processed by a browser application or an email message may be processed by the email messaging application and output to the display . A user of the mobile device may also compose data items such as email messages for example using the input devices in conjunction with the display screen . These composed items may be transmitted through the communication subsystem over the wireless network .

In the voice communication mode the mobile device provides telephony functions and operates as a typical cellular phone. The overall operation is similar except that the received signals are output to the speaker and signals for transmission are generated by a transducer such as the microphone . The telephony functions are provided by a combination of software firmware i.e. the phone application and hardware i.e. the microphone the speaker and input devices . Alternative voice or audio I O subsystems such as a voice message recording subsystem may also be implemented on the mobile device . Although voice or audio signal output is typically accomplished primarily through the speaker the display screen may also be used to provide an indication of the identity of a calling party duration of a voice call or other voice call related information.

The phone application can be split into multiple applications or sub modules for example one or more user phone modules and a call control module. The user phone modules provide a variety of telephony features through a user interface while the call control module provides access to common telephony functions desired by the user phone modules such that telephony requests from phone modules can be coordinated and so that the user phone modules do not need to each provide instructions understood by the wireless communications subsystem . The call control function typically makes telephony features available to user phone modules through an application programming interface API . It is to be recognized that all or part of the phone application features or functions could be provided through the operating system or otherwise distributed in the device while continuing to fall within the term phone application .

Referring now to an exemplary computer readable media will be described. The computer readable media have computer readable instructions stored thereon that when implemented cause a processor to execute any one of the methods described herein. For the purposes of the application computer readable media comprise any tangible computer storage such as but not limited to flash memory read only memory CD DVD and memory sticks. Graphical authentication module described above with reference to is an exemplary implementation of computer readable media . However it is to be understood that the computer readable media is not limited to use on mobile devices such as mobile device described above. Non limiting examples of the processor include a CPU central processing unit on a personal computer laptop computer tablet device personal digital assistant PDA mobile telephone smart phone bank machine digital authentication system for entry to rooms or buildings or control system. Any device with a processor a display and a user interface enabling a user to move images on the display could feasibly make use of the computer readable media to authenticate users.

A flow chart of a method implemented by the processor is shown in . The method is a method of authenticating a user of a computing device the computing device having a memory storing an authentication video having a pre selected time reference point. The method starts with displaying on a display the authentication video. Then the method continues with receiving an input at a point in time in the video. Then at action in response to the point in time in the video matching the pre selected time reference point positive authentication is indicated. The input in some embodiments is the depression of a key on the computing device. In other embodiments it is a touch on a touchscreen. In other embodiments the input is a key press on a keyboard. Any form of input recognisable by the computing device is feasible In some embodiments there is a tolerance for the time of the input. For example if the time of the point in time in the video is within the tolerance before or after the pre selected time reference point positive authentication will be indicated. Non limiting examples of indicating positive authentication include providing a visual indicator providing an audible indicator and allowing user access.

Referring now to another example method will be described. The method in starts with actions and from . Then after receiving the input a determination is made of whether or not the point in time matches the pre selected time reference point. If the determination is that there is a match the method proceeds to action which is the same as action in that is indicating positive authentication. If there is no match the method proceeds to indicating that authentication failed.

The indication that authentication failed in some embodiments is an audio signal. In some embodiments the indication that authentication failed is a visual output on the display. In some embodiments if authentication failed the method starts over. In some embodiments after a set number of failed authentication attempts a user is locked out and not permitted to attempt authentication again In some embodiments the user is locked out until an administrator overrides the lock out. In other embodiments the lock out is for a set time period.

In some embodiments the method further comprises timing the authentication attempt. If positive authentication is not indicated within a time limit the method proceeds to action i.e. indicating that authentication failed.

In an alternate embodiment when the overlay image is moved the modified base image disappears. In other words the moving comprises moving the overlay image and the method further comprises removing the modified base image from the display in response to receiving the input. Therefore the user must remember where the base image reference point was located on the display and align the overlay image reference point without being able to see it. This adds security in that a third party can not see any two points being aligned However tolerances for alignment would likely be less strict than in the case where the user can see the base image reference point.

In some embodiments the video is animated. In some embodiments the video is live action. In some embodiments the authentication video stored comprises data and or instructions for generating an animated video of a selection of images. In some embodiments displaying the authentication video comprises replaying the authentication video until positive authentication is indicated or until the method is terminated in some other manner such as a failure to authenticate or a cancellation command.

In some embodiments the method further comprises receiving a further input at a further point in time in the video wherein positive authentication is only indicated if the point in time in the video matches the pre selected time reference point and the further point in time matches a further pre selected time reference point. In some embodiments the input comprises activating an input mechanism on the computing device and the further input comprises releasing the input mechanism.

Some implementations display a further video on the display concurrently with the authentication video. In these implementations a third party observer would have difficulty determining which video a user is watching and thus have difficulty determining the pre selected time reference point even if the third party observer did observe an inputting action.

In some embodiments positive authentication further requires that a reference point be selected at the pre selected time reference point. For example if the video depicts a person walking the reference point could be the person s hat and positive authentication could require selection of the hat at a point in time when the person is passing by a particular tree.

In some implementations the method further comprises displaying an overlay image comprising a pre selected overlay image reference point and receiving a further input to move the overlay image. Positive authentication is indicated in response to the overlay image reference point being aligned with a pre selected image present in the video at the pre selected time reference point. The use of the overlay image makes it difficult to determine the pre selected image in the video because the third party observer will not know what part of the overlay image is the overlay image reference point. In some embodiments positive authentication is indicated in response to the overlay image reference point being aligned with a pre selected image present in the video at the pre selected time and in response to the overlay image reference point being aligned with a further pre selected image present in the video at a further pre selected time. In some implementations alignment with the pre selected image is indicated by activating an input mechanism on the computing device and alignment with the further pre selected image is indicated by releasing the input mechanism.

In some embodiments the reference point on either the authentication video or on the overlay image or both are represented by a dot an x or some other symbol next to a recognizable part of the image such as a number character or object. In some embodiments dots x s or other symbols appear next to some or all other objects in the video or overlay image. In some embodiments aligning the reference point with the pre selected image includes bringing the reference point within a predefined distance of the pre selected image. In other words there may be a tolerance zone. An example of a tolerance zone is an area around a reference point in which a user selection will be interpreted as selection of the reference point. The tolerance zone can be made smaller for increased security or larger where less precision is possible. In some embodiments the tolerance zone is variable and is made smaller when increased security is required.

It is to be understood that any number and combination of pre selected time reference points and reference points can be used.

In some example embodiments the computer readable media is located on the computing device. shows a computing device with computer readable media installed thereon. The computing device also comprises a memory on which the authentication video is stored. Non limiting examples of formats for storing the authentication video include H.263 H.264 and MPEG 4. In some embodiments the memory is an external memory such as a memory stick or a memory on a server. A display is also provided for displaying representations or modified versions of the authentication video and the overlay image . In some embodiments the display is a touchscreen. In some embodiments the display is a multi touch screen. In some embodiments the display is a 3 D screen.

As mentioned above some embodiments use an overlay image. shows the computing device with an overlay image also stored in the memory . It is to be understood that the video and the overlay image in other embodiments are stored on different memories. Non limiting examples of formats in which the overlay image are stores are bitmap PDF JPEG and PNG. In some embodiments for example where a grid is used the format of the image can include different fonts or font technologies.

In some embodiments of the computer readable media a modified overlay image is generated and displayed In some embodiments generating the modified overlay image comprises randomly altering the position of the overlay image reference point. In some embodiments both the reference point in the video and the overlay image reference point positions are altered. Examples of altering the overlay image include but are not limited to stretching the image rubber band effect blurring portions of the image compressing the image and morphing the image. Another example involves generating a collage of images from the base image or overlay image where the collage can be reconfigured. In such an embodiment in presenting the collage or modified image the respective reference points should be visible and not overlapped. In some embodiments if the reference point is a number or character the font can be changed.

Non limiting examples of displaying the modified overlay image include presenting the overlay image at a different location each time the instructions are executed distorting the appearance of the image and rotating the modified image.

In some embodiments of the computer readable media the input comprises a movement of a cursor or pointer or of the overlay image. The movement is achieved by the user using navigation controls on the computing device in some embodiments. For example a mouse can be used to click and drag the overlay image. If a touch screen is used the user can touch and drag the overlay image. Other non limiting navigation controls include keys on a keyboard a touchpad a trackball a thumbwheel and a joystick. In an exemplary embodiment the input comprises a sequence of movements. In some embodiments the representations of the overlay image must be moved in a specific sequence. Some embodiments restrict the movement in horizontal diagonal or vertical directions. In some embodiments gestures are used to control the movement. For example pressure or an accelerometer can control the movement.

Screen wrap can also be used in some embodiments to confuse third party observers. Screen wrap can be used in at least two manners. In the first when part of the image moves off one edge of the display that part appears immediately on the opposite side. In the first manner the image is usually the same size as the display. In the second manner which is sometimes used when the image is larger than the display part of the image moves off the edge but is not seen immediately on the opposite side In this case the third party observer would not see the entire image. In some such embodiments one or more of the reference points may not be visible on the screen at first and the user has to move the representation of the respective image to bring the reference point into view.

In one embodiment the overlay image is a grid of numbers and when the modified overlay image is displayed the grid could move up or down with only a portion of the grid visible i.e higher or lower numbers may not be visible. The user moves the grid to align the pre selected number with the reference point on the modified base image. In some embodiments the pre selected number must be moved up or down to the proper height and then moved left or right to align with the reference point on the authentication video. The requirement to move a reference point vertically and then horizontally or vice versa can be used in any embodiment and is not limited to a grid of numbers.

In some embodiments the overlay image is a grid of images or objects and displaying the modified overlay image comprises altering the position of the pre selected overlay image reference point while maintaining at least one of a column and a row with images or objects having a common characteristic. In an exemplary embodiment the grid is a grid of numbers with all of the x1s in one column 1 11 21 etc. and all of the x2s in another column 2 12 22 etc and so on but the position of each number with the respective column changes each time the instructions are executed. For example if the grid is a grid of numbers and the pre selected reference point on the overlay image is the number 23 each time the grid is presented the reference point will be in a different row and column but always in the same column as the 20s and the same row as the x3s . If the grid consists of shapes of varying sizes colours or other features a feature square shape for example could always be in the same column but the position in the column could change. Maintaining the reference point in a column or row with points of a common characteristic provides some assistance to the user in finding the reference point while maintaining the added security of randomly altering the location of the reference point.

In still another embodiment the grid is randomly generated in response to a user input such as but not limited to a gesture selecting a key and a sequence of keystrokes. For example with a device with an accelerometer shaking could reset the grid. In other embodiments the authentication video or the modified overlay image or both could be programmed to reset after a predetermined period of time.

Referring to a computing device will be described. In some embodiments the computing device is a mobile communications device such as the mobile device described herein. However it is to be understood that the computing device can be any computing device. Non limiting examples include a personal computer laptop computer tablet device personal digital assistant PDA mobile telephone smart phone bank machine digital authentication system for entry to rooms or buildings or control system.

The computing device comprises the computer readable media a display and a processor . The user interface is for receiving user instructions for instructions to align the base image reference point and the overlay image reference point. The display is used to display the authentication video and the modified overlay image. The processor for executing the instructions. The computing device in some embodiments also comprises a flash memory on which the authentication module is located.

In some embodiments dedicated controls are provided on the computing device for moving the representations of the authentication video or the overlay image or both.

It is to be understood that the embodiments described herein are not limited to one authentication video and one overlay image. Multiple layers of images or videos are possible. Furthermore multiple reference points on each layer are also possible.

Referring now to the screens shots of and a specific implementation of a proposed method will be described. shows a screen shot of an authentication video at a first point in time. A scene including a number of objects is shown. For illustrative purposes the scene includes a flower a tree a bird a cloud and a sun . Also shown is a person walking past the flower along a path. Any number of the objects in the video is in motion. The pre selected point in time in the authentication video in this case is the time when the person walks past the tree . This point in time is shown in . Receipt of the input at this pre selected point in time results in positive authentication.

Referring now to and a specific implementation of a proposed method using an authentication video and an overlay image will be described. shows the authentication video at the same point in time as . An overlay image comprising a grid of randomly generated numbers from 1 to 12 is displayed over the video . An overlay image reference point has been pre selected. In this case the overlay image reference point is the number 8. In the video has progressed to the same point in time as in and the overlay image has been moved so that the number 8 is aligned with the person as the person is passing by the tree . Receiving an input such as a release of an input mechanism at this point in time results in positive authentication in this example.
