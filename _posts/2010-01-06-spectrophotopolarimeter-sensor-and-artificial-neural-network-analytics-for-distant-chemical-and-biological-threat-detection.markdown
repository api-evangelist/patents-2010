Accordingly the examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the embodiments herein.

According to the embodiments herein an aerosol aggregate is interrogated by multiple COlaser beams spanning the middle infrared region where the subject analyte is molecularly vibration active. Incident irradiance and backscatter radiance of the beams are distinctly polarization modulated for electronic acquisition of the Mueller matrix and building of a core database. The database is a resource of input data fields for training and validating hybrid Kohonen self organizing map feed forward artificial neural network models that serve pattern recognition and classification roles. The best performance networks mathematically cluster analyte interferent and control plumes accurately with near overlap of aerosol classes. Referring now to the drawings and more particularly to where similar reference characters denote corresponding features consistently throughout the figures there are shown preferred embodiments.

For ease of understanding notations of vectors are designated in italics below. From classical field theory consider a transverse electromagnetic wave TEMW propagating in direction k kn 2 n with field vector E of mathematical form 1 where k is wavevector n is its unit normal vector is wavelength. 2 is circular frequency and linear frequency of oscillation t is time of propagation x is field position and are orthogonal unit basis vectors in the reference frame of TEMW and the complex field amplitudes along those basis vectors are 2 with real amplitudes a a and phases . Now consider E x t representing the TEMW of an infrared laser beam onto aerosol aggregate as depicted in . A Stokes vector is constructed by the parameterization of E x t amplitudes and phases by defining relationships 3a 3b 2 2cos 3c 2 2sin 3d where asterisk signifies a complex conjugation the dot symbol denotes the inner product of basis and electric field vectors paired vertical bars designate modulus or absolute value of the inner product complex number and Re Im represent real imaginary components of their respective arguments. The M matrix is a 4 4 transformation of incident laser beam 1 4 Stokes vector s s s s s into the scattered beam Stokes vector s s s s s accordingly s Ms where superscript T designates transposition. M can be derived by linking algebras of Pauli and Jones accordingly 4 where J is the complex Jones matrix are real Pauli matrices tr denotes trace of matrix product and the dagger symbol represents Hermitian transposition. Substitution and factorization yield the elegant Jones representation of M.

M elements carry functional dependencies on geometric particle shape and size of scatterer bundled variables denoted as symbol d in and its spectroscopy is derived from the complex refractive index N i . Real and imaginary components of N are nonlinear variables in the neighborhood of resonant absorption of a beam by the aerosol aggregate whereby d d 0. An evanescence phase change is manifest in s superscript a absorptive at the peak absorption beam cross section relative to phase conservation in s superscript n nonabsorptive at the resonance tail where N . A DIAMMS sensor of identifies the analyte by discerning contrasts between sand s i.e. sets of susceptible differential absorption M elements are associated to the analyte and vice versa one to one . Artificial neural network technology is the preferred embodiment for mappings of M elements into detection events or non events.

In Stokes vectors a Mueller matrix and polarized scattering from an aerosol aggregate are depicted. Stacked rectangular objects depict the electromagnetic field wavefronts surfaces of exact constant phase of an incident infrared laser beam moving right to left onto the aerosol aggregate direction of arrow inside rectangle . The beam is polarization modulated via variable stress birefringence imposed on a ZnSc crystal. The incident beam of defined Stokes vectors sscatters from aerosol aggregate comprising interferents and analyte particles producing a scattered beam reactant Stokes vector swhose wavefronts are of constant phase propagating away from aerosol aggregate which is distinctly polarization modulated a second time. The Mueller matrix is the transformation of Stokes vectors and its elements M elements are generally functions of beam wavelength polar and azimuth orientations and particle shape and size d . The embodiments herein focus on backscattering i s . The polarization modulation of incident and scattered beam wavefronts encode sfor electronic measurement of all 16 M elements. Those M elements exhibiting susceptible behaviors by the analyte as it is driven in to and out of molecular vibration resonance by probing beams provide a foundation for the identification and standoff detection of that analyte .

The dual continuous wave COlaser beams the asterisk implies laser with isotopic COgain medium are directed into entrance ports of the optical switching device whose output is an alternate square wave sequence . . . . . . of equal intensity beams. Moreover the device directs into optical spectrum analyzers for wavelength determinations and splits a small fraction of . . . . . . into power meter head . Upon exiting the device . . . . . . is directed through coupled linear polarizer then photoelastic modulation optics POL PEM mounted to precision rotary stage . The POL confines the temporal TEMW E field vector to a given plane and establishes s. The PEM then polarization modulates svia periodic stress strain birefringence transduction whose mechanism is described below.

The orthogonal E field components of TEMW incident to the front surface of PEM birefringent ZnSe crystal are aligned such that components of equal amplitude traverse extra ordinary and ordinary axes in the crystalline structure by virtue of a 45 alignment between axes of POL PEM optics. The phase in the traveling extra ordinary TEMW component undulates as cos as natural mechanical resonance in the cleaved and antireflection coated ZnSe crystal is driven via tuned piezoelectric stress compression relaxation acting across opposing ends of the crystal transduction where is the peak phase retardation and is the modulation frequency of the transducer. The traveling orthogonal ordinary component of TEMW is unaltered in phase. Ordinary and extra ordinary E field components in and out of phase with each other combine at the exiting surface of ZnSe PEM crystal transforming linearly polarized sinto a continuum of left and right linear elliptical circular polarization states.

The subject aerosol aggregate reacts to one continuum polarization cycle in 27.03 s transmitter PEM modulates at 37 kHz ad interim and ad fin. The incident polarization modulated beams . . . . . . are next reflected twice by 90 by flat mirrors not visible in the view provided in but proximate to position behind the spider as well as position in the center of spider with a latter mirror mounted onto spider and then the beams . . . . . . are directed through aerosol chamber of with entrance exit apertures centered on axis of the spectrophotopolarimeter receiver the receiver comprising primary telescope spherical mirror secondary Cassegrain telescope spherical mirror i.e. near position a 10 condenser optic in the style of a Cassegrain telescope second mated PEM then POL pair variable neutral density filter wheel 90 parabolic mirror and cryogenic detector whose 1 1 mmHgCdTe photoconductive chip is on focus of mirror . As in the transmitter the PEM POL group is axially aligned 45 and permuted by its rotary stage not clearly visible in the view provided in but proximate to position in accordance to M elements data acquisition protocol. The receiver PEM modulates at 39 kHz a 2 kHz offset from the transmitter PEM. A conversion of dual PEM polarization modulation to intensity modulation in s Msis a ramification of the linear polarizer optic POL in receiver PEM POL . This intensity of s received at the HgCdTe chip is regulated via the bidirectional rotation of a variable neutral density filter wheel for proper M elements production.

The determination of the M elements is equivalent to a lock in detection of eight coefficients of primary and overtone frequencies in splus an additional phase insensitive component. There is one and only one M element assignment per primary overtone frequency. Furthermore all frequency components in shave Bessel coefficients J where is the maximum retardation of stressed PEM crystals. The quantity 2.404 radians a null in the zero order Bessel function J 0 is held during spectral M elements acquisitions. J are dampening coefficients in the Fourier transformation intensity functional I of s 

Transmitter and receiver optic groups POL PEM PEM POL are permuted in four distinct 45 rotations two permutations each between POL PEM and PEM POL optic groups and of to produce a full 16 element backscattering M of aerosol aggregate of per beam wavelength of . The effect of permutations is reassignment of M elements in Iwith degeneracy. The order of permutations is enacted within the sensor s electronics and modular C code blocks that choreograph M acquisitions in sequences. Moreover sis called a scattergram the set of optics POL PEM PEM POL is a Mueller matrix spectrometer MMS and the MMS with integrated data acquisition and preprocessing system is a DIAMMS standoff identification and detection system.

Table 1 illustrates a method of spectrophotopolarimeter calibration. Known calibrator optic is inserted and rotated within the MMS engine accordingly POL PEMM PEM POL where axial orientations in POL PEM transmitter and PEM POL receiver are V 45 45 V where V is vertical to the reference plane optics table 2 in and the sign convention is clockwise counterclockwise as viewing the laser source from the transmitter or aerosol backscattering cross section from the receiver of sensor . Calibrator is a polarizer P a quarter wave plate Q or an ordered combination thereof QP or PQ with one optic positioned stationary vertical while the other rotates uniformly. The calibration source beam is tuned to the 10 P 20 line of nonisotopic COlaser as Q and P optics are manufactured for precise wave retardation and peak extinction ratio respectively at 10.6 m.

When PEMs of MMS are active and under computer control peak retardation 2.404 radians maintained for all laser beam wavelengths the amplitude and phase inputs to each phase sensitive detector board channels 2 through 9 are adjusted so as to match s known M element in rotation angle . Table 1 lists the exact sinusoid functional associations per M element.

As indicated in Table 1 the calibration of Mueller matrix spectrometer MMS engine in the POL PEM PEM POL configuration is shown where POL PEM PEM POL axes are V 45 or 0 45 V with vertical V and 45 orientations relative to the plane of optics table of as viewing laser in the transmitter optics or backscattering in the receiver optics sources. The piezoelectric transducer frequencies of transmitter and receiver photoelastic modulation PEM crystals are 37 kHz and 39 kHz respectively and is the calibrator optic s comprising of linear polarizer POL and or quarter wave plate Q. POL 0 and Q rotate about their central axis normal to the incident laser beam Waveforms shown are the known of Mueller matrix elements of POL Q Q 0 Q POL 0 Q and Q POL 0 as listed. Mueller matrix element 1 1 the phase insensitive element is acquired separately from a split in the scattergram waveform and output by an individual lock in detection board of the DIAMMS data acquisition system of .

As an example calibration for element 1 4 requires P 0 Q a quarter wave plate rotating axially followed by a fixed vertical linear polarizer they are noncommutative optics . Channel a phase sensitive detector PSD board is active with transmitter PEM primary frequency 37 kHz as reference input sas signal input Equation 6 and Mueller element 1 4 as output. Calibration of this channel is complete when phase and amplitude settings on the PSD are adjusted to yield sin 2 precisely at the PSD output node. Likewise channels 2 and 4 9 are calibrated in the sensor s data acquisition system per the matching M element procedure described above.

The DIAMMS sensor of may be aligned to aerosol chamber for inspection of uniformity of dispersed aerosol sample inside the chamber and measurement of particle size distribution and concentration of sampling plume. A visible HeNe laser beam on axis of the sensor receiver of is shown as dotted line in . Flat mirrors are aligned outside of the chamber reflecting visible HeNe laser beam in a Z pattern and back onto itself for direct inspections of particle scattering and thus vertical aerosol density. The HeNe laser points its beam left to right in . Flat mirror is positioned at a predetermined angle that reflects the incident beam to flat mirror which then reflects the beam to flat mirror which retroreflects the beam back to the laser . A console is operatively connected to the APS for display of APS aerosol statistics.

In entrance aperture and exit aperture are aligned to the optical axis of the sensor receiver of and use shutters to close and open in synchronous to allow aerosol injection and beam transmissions through the chamber . With shutters closed material is drawn from hopper which is constantly agitated by an enclosed vibrating membrane so as to prevent binding or lumping of powder stock through nozzle via a high pressure line. An air ionizer may be used inside the chamber at times to neutralize frictionally charged particles ejected from the tip of the nozzle . With the sample dispersed shutters open . . . . . . is backscattered from aerosol and M elements data collection sequences begin via menu driven scripts. Furthermore with the shutters open a slight negative pressure inside the chamber is enacted through duct to contain aerosol mass between apertures . Subsequently ducts ventilate a slight particle laden laminar flow outside the chamber after high efficiency particulate air HEPA filtration.

The APS monitors the geometry and concentration of aerosol particles inside the chamber when M elements data collection sequences are on line. A difference in inertia lag exhibited by various particle shapes and masses become sorted in flow through a pneumatic cell of the APS via intake port . Two offset laser beams internal to the APS focused at the exit aperture not shown of the APS pneumatic cell are scattered by particles emanating from that APS cell in flow and time intervals of pulses are correlated to diameters of particles in a statistical distribution. Particle statistics and M acquisitions by the spectrophotopolarimeter are synchronized by computer clocks time stamping these disparate datasets.

As indicated above when cleaning the chamber after measurement trial s the ventilation is switched at switch so as to draw lingering aerosol mass inside the chamber outward through a HEPA filter bank via duct and outside the chamber via duct as shown in . Afterwards gloves are used to safely wash down and disinfect the internal walls of the chamber .

Furthermore as indicated above in the chamber is illustrated prior to an aerosol M elements data collection run and after chamber sensor optical alignment. Visible beam of from a He Ne laser co aligns entrance exit apertures a laboratory exit port not shown and the optical axis of the spectrophotopolarimeter receiver of . Another visible beam crisscrosses the length and height of the interior of the chamber via flat mirrors mounted just outside the clear chamber . Homogeneity of an aerosol scatterer is inspected by direct observation of scattered beam . These observations help balance the slight negative internal pressure of the chamber discussed above. Aerosol particle number density surface density and mass count are recorded in computer memory e.g. as shown in along with particle size and concentration statistics. These data are inclusive of particle count medium mean standard deviation geometric standard deviation skewness coefficient of variance and diameter average statistics with or without log normal distribution.

Examples of software platforms for developing all hybrid Kohonen self organizing map feed forward artificial neural network models are the NeuralSight software the Neural Works Predict software and libraries supplied by the NeuralWare company of Carnegie Pa. USA. The NeuralSight software is a high throughput artificial neural network ANN model generator that automates structural and learning rule decisions in training SOM models while the NeuralWorks Predict software utilizes an extensive library of mathematical transformations for producing inputs to the ANN multi classifiers.

SOM architectures are currently specified manually. The multi classifiers of aerosol aggregates comprise standard feed forward ANNs trained using the gradient descent back propagation algorithm and relative entropy as an internal fitness function. In this modeling effort a wide variety of mathematical transformations from the NeuralWorks Predict software operate on raw M elements input vectors from the sensor. A genetic algorithm optimizer is executed moreover to identify the most promising variables for ANN training and validation. A method of cascade correlation training within specified limits is used to automatically determine nodes per dimension in the final architecture of candidate ANN classifiers.

Experimental results of SOM modeling from data in the core Mueller matrix knowledge repository the middle infrared measurements of all 16 M elements from nonviable irradiated and chicken egg white albumen analytes Arizona road dust and water vapor interferents and two talcum powders are summarized in Table 2. Dimensions and number of epochs passes through the dataset for SOM maps varied in training the ANN classifier. In generating the results 16 data fields 15 normalized non 1 1 M elements plus the 1 1 element are clustered per aerosol spanning the 9.1 12.0 m bandwidth of the sensor of . All SOM maps are trained from the same dataset used to train the ANN classification models. SOM training may be terminated after 20 000 iterations through an M elements dataset comprising 1 560 records all aerosols . Table 2 summarizes the classification model performance metrics of the SOM.

However the transition of DIAMMS technology to a field able tactical sensor must fulfill certain requirements for success. Among these are demonstrating the capabilities of DIAMMS to i characterize threat agents in situ at safe distances by type and if possible quantity with minimum false positives negatives ii mitigate contaminant threat and produce guidance in evacuating areas of danger and iii aid in establishing contamination avoidance perimeters.
